               INT. COFFEE SHOP  MORNING

               A normal Denny's, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles. 
               It's about 9:00 in the morning. While the place isn't jammed, 
               there's a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching 
               on bacon and eating eggs.

               Two of these people are a YOUNG MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN. The 
               Young Man has a slight working-class English accent and, 
               like his fellow countryman, smokes cigarettes like they're 
               going out of style.

               It is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or 
               how old she is; everything she does contradicts something 
               she did. The boy and girl sit in a booth. Their dialogue is 
               to be said in a rapid pace "HIS GIRL FRIDAY" fashion.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm 
                         through doin' that shit.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         You always say that, the same thing 
                         every time: never again, I'm through, 
                         too dangerous.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I know that's what I always say. I'm 
                         always right too, but 

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                          but you forget about it in a day 
                         or two -

                                     YOUNG MAN
                          yeah, well, the days of me 
                         forgittin' are over, and the days of 
                         me rememberin' have just begun.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         When you go on like this, you know 
                         what you sound like?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I sound like a sensible fucking man, 
                         is what I sound like.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         You sound like a duck.
                              (imitates a duck)
                         Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, 
                         quack, quack...

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Well take heart, 'cause you're never 
                         gonna hafta hear it again. Because 
                         since I'm never gonna do it again, 
                         you're never gonna hafta hear me 
                         quack about how I'm never gonna do 
                         it again.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         After tonight.

               The boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in 
               there, back and forth.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                              (with a smile)
                         Correct. I got all tonight to quack.

               A WAITRESS comes by with a pot of coffee.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Can I get anybody anymore coffee?

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Oh yes, thank you.

               The Waitress pours the Young Woman's coffee. The Young Man 
               lights up another cigarette.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I'm doin' fine.

               The Waitress leaves. The Young Man takes a drag off of his 
               smoke.

               The Young Woman pours a ton of cream and sugar into her 
               coffee.

               The Young Man goes right back into it.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I mean the way it is now, you're 
                         takin' the same fuckin' risk as when 
                         you rob a bank. You take more of a 
                         risk. Banks are easier!  Federal 
                         banks aren't supposed to stop you 
                         anyway, during a robbery. They're 
                         insured, why should they care? You 
                         don't even need a gun in a federal 
                         bank. I heard about this guy, walked 
                         into a federal bank with a portable 
                         phone, handed the phone to the teller, 
                         the guy on the other end of the phone 
                         said: "We got this guy's little girl, 
                         and if you don't give him all your 
                         money, we're gonna kill 'er."

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Did it work?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Fuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm 
                         talkin' about! Knucklehead walks in 
                         a bank with a telephone, not a pistol, 
                         not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone, 
                         cleans the place out, and they don't 
                         lift a fuckin' finger.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Did they hurt the little girl?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I don't know. There probably never 
                         was a little girl  the point of the 
                         story isn't the little girl. The 
                         point of the story is they robbed 
                         the bank with a telephone.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         You wanna rob banks?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks, 
                         I'm just illustrating that if we 
                         did, it would be easier than what we 
                         been doin'.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         So you don't want to be a bank robber?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Naw, all those guys are goin' down 
                         the same road, either dead or servin' 
                         twenty.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         And no more liquor stores?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         What have we been talking about? 
                         Yeah, no more-liquor-stores. Besides, 
                         it ain't the giggle it usta be. Too 
                         many foreigners own liquor stores. 
                         Vietnamese, Koreans, they can't 
                         fuckin' speak English. You tell 'em: 
                         "Empty out the register," and they 
                         don't know what it fuckin' means. 
                         They make it too personal. We keep 
                         on, one of those gook motherfuckers' 
                         gonna make us kill 'em.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         I'm not gonna kill anybody.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I don't wanna kill anybody either. 
                         But they'll probably put us in a 
                         situation where it's us of them. And 
                         if it's not the gooks, it these old 
                         Jews who've owned the store for 
                         fifteen fuckin' generations. Ya got 
                         Grandpa Irving sittin' behind the 
                         counter with a fuckin' Magnum. Try 
                         walkin' into one of those stores 
                         with nothin' but a telephone, see 
                         how far it gets you. Fuck it, forget 
                         it, we're out of it.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Well, what else is there, day jobs?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                              (laughing)
                         Not this life.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Well what then?

               He calls to the Waitress.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Garcon! Coffee!

               Then looks to his girl.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         This place.

               The Waitress comes by, pouring him some more.

                                     WAITRESS
                              (snotty)
                         "Garcon" means boy.

               She splits.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Here? It's a coffee shop.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         What's wrong with that? People never 
                         rob restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor 
                         stores, gas stations, you get your 
                         head blown off stickin' up one of 
                         them. Restaurants, on the other hand, 
                         you catch with their pants down. 
                         They're not expecting to get robbed, 
                         or not as expecting.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                              (taking to idea)
                         I bet in places like this you could 
                         cut down on the hero factor.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Correct. Just like banks, these places 
                         are insured. The managers don't give 
                         a fuck, they're just tryin' to get 
                         ya out the door before you start 
                         pluggin' diners.  Waitresses, forget 
                         it, they ain't takin' a bullet for 
                         the register. Busboys, some wetback 
                         gettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour 
                         gonna really give a fuck you're 
                         stealin' from the owner. Customers 
                         are sittin' there with food in their 
                         mouths, they don't know what's goin' 
                         on. One minute they're havin' a Denver 
                         omelet, next minute somebody's 
                         stickin' a gun in their face.

               The Young Woman visibly takes in the idea. The Young Man 
               continues in a low voice.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         See, I got the idea last liquor store 
                         we stuck up. 'Member all those 
                         customers kept comin' in?

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Yeah.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Then you got the idea to take 
                         everybody's wallet.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Uh-huh.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         That was a good idea.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Thanks.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         We made more from the wallets then 
                         we did the register.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Yes we did.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         A lot of people go to restaurants.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         A lot of wallets.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Pretty smart, huh?

               The Young Woman scans the restaurant with this new 
               information.

               She sees all the PATRONS eating, lost in conversations. The 
               tired WAITRESS, taking orders. The BUSBOYS going through the 
               motions, collecting dishes. The MANAGER complaining to the 
               COOK about something. A smiles breaks out on the Young Woman's 
               face.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Pretty smart.
                              (into it)
                         I'm ready, let's go, right here, 
                         right now.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Remember, same as before, you're 
                         crowd control, I handle the employees.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Got it.

               They both take out their .32-caliber pistols and lay them on 
               the table. He looks at her and she back at him.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         I love you, Pumpkin.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I love you, Honey Bunny.

               And with that, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny grab their weapons, 
               stand up and rob the restaurant. Pumpkin's robbery persona 
               is that of the in-control professional. Honey Bunny's is 
               that of the psychopathic, hair-triggered, loose cannon.

                                     PUMPKIN
                              (yelling to all)

                         I'll execute every one of you 
                         motherfuckers!  Got that?

               INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING)  MORNING

               An old gas guzzling, dirty, white 1974 Chevy Nova BARRELS 
               down a homeless-ridden street in Hollywood. In the front 
               seat are two young fellas  one white, one black  both 
               wearing cheap black suits with thin black ties under long 
               green dusters. Their names are VINCENT VEGA (white) and JULES 
               WINNFIELD (black). Jules is behind the wheel.

                                     JULES
                          Okay now, tell me about the hash 
                         bars?

                                     VINCENT
                         What so you want to know?

                                     JULES
                         Well, hash is legal there, right?

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a 
                         hundred percent legal. I mean you 
                         can't walk into a restaurant, roll a 
                         joint, and start puffin' away. You're 
                         only supposed to smoke in your home 
                         or certain designated places.

                                     JULES
                         Those are hash bars?

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah, it breaks down like this: it's 
                         legal to buy it, it's legal to own 
                         it and, if you're the proprietor of 
                         a hash bar, it's legal to sell it. 
                         It's legal to carry it, which doesn't 
                         really matter 'cause  get a load of 
                         this  if the cops stop you, it's 
                         illegal for this to search you. 
                         Searching you is a right that the 
                         cops in Amsterdam don't have.

                                     JULES
                         That did it, man  I'm fuckin' goin', 
                         that's all there is to it.

                                     VINCENT
                         You'll dig it the most. But you know 
                         what the funniest thing about Europe 
                         is?

                                     JULES
                         What?

                                     VINCENT
                         It's the little differences. A lotta 
                         the same shit we got here, they got 
                         there, but there they're a little 
                         different.

                                     JULES
                         Examples?

                                     VINCENT
                         Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer 
                         in a movie theatre. And I don't mean 
                         in a paper cup either. They give you 
                         a glass of beer, like in a bar. In 
                         Paris, you can buy beer at 
                         MacDonald's. Also, you know what 
                         they call a Quarter Pounder with 
                         Cheese in Paris?

                                     JULES
                         They don't call it a Quarter Pounder 
                         with Cheese?

                                     VINCENT
                         No, they got the metric system there, 
                         they wouldn't know what the fuck a 
                         Quarter Pounder is.

                                     JULES
                         What'd they call it?

                                     VINCENT
                         Royale with Cheese.

                                     JULES
                              (repeating)
                         Royale with Cheese. What'd they call 
                         a Big Mac?

                                     VINCENT
                         Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call 
                         it Le Big Mac.

                                     JULES
                         Le Big Mac. What do they call a 
                         Whopper?

                                     VINCENT
                         I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger 
                         King.  But you know what they put on 
                         french fries in Holland instead of 
                         ketchup?

                                     JULES
                         What?

                                     VINCENT
                         Mayonnaise.

                                     JULES
                         Goddamn!

                                     VINCENT
                         I seen 'em do it. And I don't mean a 
                         little bit on the side of the plate, 
                         they fuckin' drown 'em in it.

                                     JULES
                         Uuccch!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CHEVY (TRUNK)  MORNING

               The trunk of the Chevy OPENS UP, Jules and Vincent reach 
               inside, taking out two .45 Automatics, loading and cocking 
               them.

                                     JULES
                         We should have shotguns for this 
                         kind of deal.

                                     VINCENT
                         How many up there?

                                     JULES
                         Three or four.

                                     VINCENT
                         Counting our guy?

                                     JULES
                         I'm not sure.

                                     VINCENT
                         So there could be five guys up there?

                                     JULES
                         It's possible.

                                     VINCENT
                         We should have fuckin' shotguns.

               They CLOSE the trunk.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING COURTYARD  MORNING

               Vincent and Jules, their long matching overcoats practically 
               dragging on the ground, walk through the courtyard of what 
               looks like a hacienda-style Hollywood apartment building.

               We TRACK alongside.

                                     VINCENT
                         What's her name?

                                     JULES
                         Mia.

                                     VINCENT
                         How did Marsellus and her meet?

                                     JULES
                         I dunno, however people meet people. 
                         She usta be an actress.

                                     VINCENT
                         She ever do anything I woulda saw?

                                     JULES
                         I think her biggest deal was she 
                         starred in a pilot.

                                     VINCENT
                         What's a pilot?

                                     JULES
                         Well, you know the shows on TV?

                                     VINCENT
                         I don't watch TV.

                                     JULES
                         Yes, but you're aware that there's 
                         an invention called television, and 
                         on that invention they show shows?

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah.

                                     JULES
                         Well, the way they pick the shows on 
                         TV is they make one show, and that 
                         show's called a pilot. And they show 
                         that one show to the people who pick 
                         the shows, and on the strength of 
                         that one show, they decide if they 
                         want to make more shows. Some get 
                         accepted and become TV programs, and 
                         some don't, and become nothing. She 
                         starred in one of the ones that became 
                         nothing.

               They enter the apartment building.

               INT. RECEPTION AREA (APARTMENT BUILDING)  MORNING

               Vincent and Jules walk through the reception area and wait 
               for the elevator.

                                     JULES
                         You remember Antwan Rockamora? Half-
                         black, half-Samoan, usta call him 
                         Tony Rocky Horror.

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah maybe, fat right?

                                     JULES
                         I wouldn't go so far as to call the 
                         brother fat. He's got a weight 
                         problem.  What's the nigger gonna 
                         do, he's Samoan.

                                     VINCENT
                         I think I know who you mean, what 
                         about him?

                                     JULES
                         Well, Marsellus fucked his ass up 
                         good.  And word around the campfire, 
                         it was on account of Marsellus 
                         Wallace's wife.

               The elevator arrives, the men step inside.

               INT. ELEVATOR  MORNING

                                     VINCENT
                         What'd he do, fuck her?

                                     JULES
                         No no no no no no no, nothin' that 
                         bad.

                                     VINCENT
                         Well what then?

                                     JULES
                         He gave her a foot massage.

                                     VINCENT
                         A foot massage?

               Jules nods his head: "Yes."

                                     VINCENT
                         That's all?

               Jules nods his head: "Yes."

                                     VINCENT
                         What did Marsellus do?

                                     JULES
                         Sent a couple of guys over to his 
                         place.  They took him out on the 
                         patio of his apartment, threw his 
                         ass over the balcony.  Nigger fell 
                         four stories. They had this garden 
                         at the bottom, enclosed in glass, 
                         like one of them greenhouses  nigger 
                         fell through that. Since then, he's 
                         kinda developed a speech impediment.

               The elevator doors open, Jules and Vincent exit.

                                     VINCENT
                         That's a damn shame.

               INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY  MORNING

               STEADICAM in front of Jules and Vincent as they make a beeline 
               down the hall.

                                     VINCENT
                         Still I hafta say, play with matches, 
                         ya get burned.

                                     JULES
                         Whaddya mean?

                                     VINCENT
                         You don't be givin' Marsellus 
                         Wallace's new bride a foot massage.

                                     JULES
                         You don't think he overreacted?

                                     VINCENT
                         Antwan probably didn't expect 
                         Marsellus to react like he did, but 
                         he had to expect a reaction.

                                     JULES
                         It was a foot massage, a foot massage 
                         is nothing, I give my mother a foot 
                         massage.

                                     VINCENT
                         It's laying hands on Marsellus 
                         Wallace's new wife in a familiar 
                         way. Is it as bad as eatin' her out 
                          no, but you're in the same fuckin' 
                         ballpark.

               Jules stops Vincent.

                                     JULES
                         Whoa... whoa... whoa... stop right 
                         there.  Eatin' a bitch out, and givin' 
                         a bitch a foot massage ain't even 
                         the same fuckin' thing.

                                     VINCENT
                         Not the same thing, the same ballpark.

                                     JULES
                         It ain't no ballpark either. Look 
                         maybe your method of massage differs 
                         from mine, but touchin' his lady's 
                         feet, and stickin' your tongue in 
                         her holyiest of holyies, ain't the 
                         same ballpark, ain't the same league, 
                         ain't even the same fuckin' sport.
                         Foot massages don't mean shit.

                                     VINCENT
                         Have you ever given a foot massage?

                                     JULES
                         Don't be tellin' me about foot 
                         massages  I'm the foot fuckin' 
                         master.

                                     VINCENT
                         Given a lot of 'em?

                                     JULES
                         Shit yeah. I got my technique down 
                         man, I don't tickle or nothin'.

                                     VINCENT
                         Have you ever given a guy a foot 
                         massage?

               Jules looks at him a long moment  he's been set up.

                                     JULES
                         Fuck you.

               He starts walking down the hall.  Vincent, smiling, walks a 
               little bit behind.

                                     VINCENT
                         How many?

                                     JULES
                         Fuck you.

                                     VINCENT
                         Would you give me a foot massage  
                         I'm kinda tired.

                                     JULES
                         Man, you best back off, I'm gittin' 
                         pissed  this is the door.

               The two men stand in front of the door numbered "49." They 
               whisper.

                                     JULES
                         What time is it?

                                     VINCENT
                              (checking his watch)
                         Seven-twenty-two in the morning.

                                     JULES
                         It ain't quite time, let's hang back.

               They move a little away from the door, facing each other, 
               still whispering.

                                     JULES
                         Look, just because I wouldn't give 
                         no man a foot massage, don't make it 
                         right for Marsellus to throw Antwan 
                         off a building into a glass-
                         motherfuckin-house, fuckin' up the 
                         way the nigger talks. That ain't 
                         right, man. Motherfucker do that to 
                         me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause 
                         I'd kill'a motherfucker.

                                     VINCENT
                         I'm not sayin' he was right, but 
                         you're sayin' a foot massage don't 
                         mean nothing, and I'm sayin' it does. 
                         I've given a million ladies a million 
                         foot massages and they all meant 
                         somethin'. We act like they don't, 
                         but they do. That's what's so fuckin' 
                         cool about 'em. This sensual thing's 
                         goin' on that nobody's talkin about, 
                         but you know it and she knows it, 
                         fuckin' Marsellus knew it, and Antwan 
                         shoulda known fuckin' better. That's 
                         his fuckin' wife, man. He ain't gonna 
                         have a sense of humor about that 
                         shit.

                                     JULES
                         That's an interesting point, but 
                         let's get into character.

                                     VINCENT
                         What's her name again?

                                     JULES
                         Mia. Why you so interested in big 
                         man's wife?

                                     VINCENT
                         Well, Marsellus is leavin' for Florida 
                         and when he's gone, he wants me to 
                         take care of Mia.

                                     JULES
                         Take care of her?

               Making a gun out of his finger and placing it to his head.

                                     VINCENT
                         Not that! Take her out. Show her a 
                         good time. Don't let her get lonely.

                                     JULES
                         You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace 
                         out on a date?

                                     VINCENT
                         It ain't a date. It's like when you 
                         and your buddy's wife go to a movie 
                         or somethin'. It's just... you know... 
                         good company.

               Jules just looks at him.

                                     VINCENT
                         It's not a date.

               Jules just looks at him.

               INT. APARTMENT (ROOM 49)  MORNING

               THREE YOUNG GUYS, obviously in over their heads, sit at a 
               table with hamburgers, french fries and soda pops laid out.

               One of them flips the LOUD BOLT on the door, opening it to 
               REVEAL Jules and Vincent in the hallway.

                                     JULES
                         Hey kids.

               The two men stroll inside.

               The three young caught-off-guard Guys are:

               MARVIN, the black young man, who open the door, will, as the 
               scene progresses, back into the corner.

               ROGER, a young blond-haired surfer kid with a "Flock of 
               Seagulls" haircut, who has yet to say a word, sits at the 
               table with a big sloppy hamburger in his hand.

               BRETT, a white, preppy-looking sort with a blow-dry haircut.

               Vincent and Jules take in the place, with their hands in 
               their pockets. Jules is the one who does the talking.

                                     JULES
                         How you boys doin'?

               No answer.

                                     JULES
                              (to Brett)
                         Am I trippin', or did I just ask you 
                         a question.

                                     BRETT
                         We're doin' okay.

               As Jules and Brett talk, Vincent moves behind the young Guys.

                                     JULES
                         Do you know who we are?

               Brett shakes his head: "No."

                                     JULES
                         We're associates of your business 
                         partner Marsellus Wallace, you 
                         remember your business partner 
                         dont'ya?

               No answer.

                                     JULES
                              (to Brett)
                         Now I'm gonna take a wild guess here: 
                         you're Brett, right?

                                     BRETT
                         I'm Brett.

                                     JULES
                         I thought so. Well, you remember 
                         your business partner Marsellus 
                         Wallace, dont'ya Brett?

                                     BRETT
                         I remember him.

                                     JULES
                         Good for you. Looks like me and 
                         Vincent caught you at breakfast, 
                         sorry 'bout that.  What'cha eatin'?

                                     BRETT
                         Hamburgers.

                                     JULES
                         Hamburgers. The cornerstone of any 
                         nutritious breakfast. What kinda 
                         hamburgers?

                                     BRETT
                         Cheeseburgers.

                                     JULES
                         No, I mean where did you get'em?
                         MacDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-
                         Box, where?

                                     BRETT
                         Big Kahuna Burger.

                                     JULES
                         Big Kahuna Burger. That's that 
                         Hawaiian burger joint. I heard they 
                         got some tasty burgers. I ain't never 
                         had one myself, how are they?

                                     BRETT
                         They're good.

                                     JULES
                         Mind if I try one of yours?

                                     BRETT
                         No.

                                     JULES
                         Yours is this one, right?

                                     BRETT
                         Yeah.

               Jules grabs the burger and take a bite of it.

                                     JULES
                         Uuummmm, that's a tasty burger.
                              (to Vincent)
                         Vince, you ever try a Big Kahuna 
                         Burger?

                                     VINCENT
                         No.

               Jules holds out the Big Kahuna.

                                     JULES
                         You wanna bite, they're real good.

                                     VINCENT
                         I ain't hungry.

                                     JULES
                         Well, if you like hamburgers give 
                         'em a try sometime. Me, I can't 
                         usually eat 'em 'cause my girlfriend's 
                         a vegetarian. Which more or less 
                         makes me a vegetarian, but I sure 
                         love the taste of a good burger.
                              (to Brett)
                         You know what they call a Quarter 
                         Pounder with Cheese in France?

                                     BRETT
                         No.

                                     JULES
                         Tell 'em, Vincent.

                                     VINCENT
                         Royale with Cheese.

                                     JULES
                         Royale with Cheese, you know why 
                         they call it that?

                                     BRETT
                         Because of the metric system?

                                     JULES
                         Check out the big brain on Brett. 
                         You'a smart motherfucker, that's 
                         right. The metric system.
                              (he points to a fast 
                              food drink cup)
                         What's in this?

                                     BRETT
                         Sprite.

                                     JULES
                         Sprite, good, mind if I have some of 
                         your tasty beverage to wash this 
                         down with?

                                     BRETT
                         Sure.

               Jules grabs the cup and takes a sip.

                                     JULES
                         Uuuuummmm, hit's the spot!
                              (to Roger)
                         You, Flock of Seagulls, you know 
                         what we're here for?

               Roger nods his head: "Yes."

                                     JULES
                         Then why don't you tell my boy here 
                         Vince, where you got the shit hid.

                                     MARVIN
                         It's under the be 

                                     JULES
                          I don't remember askin' you a 
                         goddamn thing.
                              (to Roger)
                         You were sayin'?

                                     ROGER
                         It's under the bed.

               Vincent moves to the bed, reaches underneath it, pulling out 
               a black snap briefcase.

                                     VINCENT
                         Got it.

               Vincent flips the two locks, opening the case. We can't see 
               what's inside, but a small glow emits from the case. Vincent 
               just stares at it, transfixed.

                                     JULES
                         We happy?

               No answer from the transfixed Vincent.

                                     JULES
                         Vincent!

               Vincent looks up at Jules.

                                     JULES
                         We happy?

               Closing the case.

                                     VINCENT
                         We're happy.

                                     BRETT
                              (to Jules)
                         Look, what's your name? I got his 
                         name's Vincent, but what's yours?

                                     JULES
                         My name's Pitt, and you ain't talkin' 
                         your ass outta this shit.

                                     BRETT
                         I just want you to know how sorry we 
                         are about how fucked up things got 
                         between us and Mr. Wallace. When we 
                         entered into this thing, we only had 
                         the best intentions 

               As Brett talks, Jules takes out his gun and SHOOTS Roger 
               three times in the chest, BLOWING him out of his chair.

               Vince smiles to himself. Jules has got style.

               Brett has just shit his pants. He's not crying or whimpering, 
               but he's so full of fear, it's as if his body is imploding.

                                     JULES
                              (to Brett)
                         Oh, I'm sorry. Did that break your 
                         concentration? I didn't mean to do 
                         that.  Please, continue. I believe 
                         you were saying something about "best 
                         intentions."

               Brett can't say a word.

                                     JULES
                         Whatsamatter? Oh, you were through 
                         anyway.  Well, let me retort. Would 
                         you describe for me what Marsellus 
                         Wallace looks like?

               Brett still can't speak.

               Jules SNAPS, SAVAGELY TIPPING the card table over, removing 
               the only barrier between himself and Brett. Brett now sits 
               in a lone chair before Jules like a political prisoner in 
               front of an interrogator.

                                     JULES
                         What country you from!

                                     BRETT
                              (petrified)
                         What?

                                     JULES
                         "What" ain't no country I know! Do 
                         they speak English in "What?"

                                     BRETT
                              (near heart attack)
                         What?

                                     JULES
                         English-motherfucker-can-you-speak-
                         it?

                                     BRETT
                         Yes.

                                     JULES
                         Then you understand what I'm sayin'?

                                     BRETT
                         Yes.

                                     JULES
                         Now describe what Marsellus Wallace 
                         looks like!

                                     BRETT
                              (out of fear)
                         What?

               Jules takes his .45 and PRESSES the barrel HARD in Brett's 
               cheek.

                                     JULES
                         Say "What" again! C'mon, say "What" 
                         again!  I dare ya, I double dare ya 
                         motherfucker, say "What" one more 
                         goddamn time!

               Brett is regressing on the spot.

                                     JULES
                         Now describe to me what Marsellus 
                         Wallace looks like!

               Brett does his best.

                                     BRETT
                         Well he's... he's... black 

                                     JULES
                          go on!

                                     BRETT
                         ...and he's... he's... bald 

                                     JULES
                          does he look like a bitch?!

                                     BRETT
                              (without thinking)
                         What?

               Jules' eyes go to Vincent, Vincent smirks, Jules rolls his 
               eyes and SHOOT Brett in the shoulder.

               Brett SCREAMS, breaking into a SHAKING/TREMBLING SPASM in 
               the chair.

                                     JULES
                         Does-he-look-like-a-bitch?!

                                     BRETT
                              (in agony)
                         No.

                                     JULES
                         Then why did you try to fuck 'im 
                         like a bitch?!

                                     BRETT
                              (in spasm)
                         I didn't.

               Now in a lower voice.

                                     JULES
                         Yes ya did Brett. Ya tried ta fuck 
                         'im.  You ever read the Bible, Brett?

                                     BRETT
                              (in spasm)
                         Yes.

                                     JULES
                         There's a passage I got memorized, 
                         seems appropriate for this situation: 
                         Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the 
                         righteous man is beset on all sides 
                         by the inequities of the selfish and 
                         the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is 
                         he who, in the name of charity and 
                         good will, shepherds the weak through 
                         the valley of darkness, for he is 
                         truly his brother's keeper and the 
                         finder of lost children. And I will 
                         strike down upon thee with great 
                         vengeance and furious anger those 
                         who attempt to poison and destroy my 
                         brothers. And you will know my name 
                         is the Lord when I lay my vengeance 
                         upon you."

               The two men EMPTY their guns at the same time on the sitting 
               Brett.

               AGAINST BLACK, TITLE CARD:

               FADE IN:

               MEDIUM SHOT  BUTCH COOLIDGE

               We FADE UP on BUTCH COOLIDGE, a white, 26-year-old 
               prizefighter.  Butch sits at a table wearing a red and blue 
               high school athletic jacket. Talking to him OFF SCREEN is 
               everybody's boss MARSELLUS WALLACE. The black man sounds 
               like a cross between a gangster and a king.

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)
                         I think you're gonna find  when all 
                         this shit is over and done  I think 
                         you're gonna find yourself one smilin'

                         about. This business is filled to 
                         the brim with unrealistic 
                         motherfuckers who thought their ass 
                         aged like wine.  Besides, even if 
                         you went all the way, what would you

                         world. Who gives a shit? I doubt you 
                         can even get a credit card based on 
                         that.

               A hand lays an envelope full of money on the table in front 
               of Butch. Butch picks it up.

                                     BUTCH
                         In the fifth, my ass goes down.

               INT. CAR (MOVING)  DAY

               Vincent Vega looks really cool behind the wheel of a 1964 
               cherry red Chevy Malibu convertible. From the car radio, 
               ROCKABILLY MUSIC PLAYS. The b.g. is a COLORFUL PROCESS SHOT.

               EXT. SALLY LEROY'S  DAY

               Sally LeRoy's is a large topless bar by LAX that Marsellus 
               owns.

               Vincent's classic Malibu WHIPS into the near empty parking 
               lot and parks next to a white Honda Civic.

               Vince knocks on the door. The front entrance is unlocked, 
               revealing the Dapper Dan fellow on the inside: ENGLISH DAVE. 
               Dave isn't really English, he's a young black man from Baldwin 
               Park, who has run a few clubs for Marsellus, including Sally 
               LeRoy's.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         Vincent Vega, our man in Amsterdam, 
                         git your ass on in here.

               Vincent, carrying the black briefcase from the scene between 
               Vincent and Jules, steps inside. English Dave SLAMS the door 
               in our faces.

               INT. SALLY LEROY'S  DAY

               The spacious club is empty this time of day. English Dave 
               crosses to the bar, and Vince follows.

                                     VINCENT
                         Where's the big man?

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         He's over there, finishing up some 
                         business.

               VINCENT'S POV: Butch shakes hands with a huge figure with 
               his back to us. The huge figure is the infamous and as of 
               yet still UNSEEN Marsellus.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE (O.S.)
                         Hang back for a second or two, and 
                         when you see the white boy leave, go 
                         on over.  In the meanwhile, can I 
                         make you an espresso?

                                     VINCENT
                         How 'bout a cup of just plain lo' 
                         American?

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         Comin' up. I hear you're taking Mia 
                         out tomorrow?

                                     VINCENT
                         At Marsellus' request.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         Have you met Mia?

                                     VINCENT
                         Not yet.

               English Dave smiles to himself.

                                     VINCENT
                         What's so funny?

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         Not a goddamn thing.

                                     VINCENT
                         Look, I'm not a idiot. She's the big 
                         man's fuckin' wife. I'm gonna sit 
                         across a table, chew my food with my 
                         mouth closed, laugh at her jokes and 
                         that's all I'm gonna do.

               English Dave puts Vince's coffee in front of him.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         My name's Paul, and this is between 
                         y'all.

               Butch bellies up to the bar next to Vincent, drinking his 
               cup of "Plain ol' American."

                                     BUTCH
                              (to English Dave)
                         Can I get a pack'a Red Apples?

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         Filters?

                                     BUTCH
                         Non.

               While Butch waits for his smokes, Vincent just sips his 
               coffee, staring at him. Butch looks over at him.

                                     BUTCH
                         Lookin' at somethin', friend?

                                     VINCENT
                         I ain't your friend, palooka.

               Butch does a slow turn toward Vincent.

                                     BUTCH
                         What was that?

                                     VINCENT
                         I think ya heard me just fine, punchy.

               Butch turns his body to Vincent, when...

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)
                         Vincent Vega has entered the building, 
                         git your ass over here!

               Vincent walks forward OUT OF FRAME, never giving Butch another 
               glance. We DOLLY INTO CU on Butch, left alone in the FRAME, 
               looking like he's ready to go into the manners-teaching 
               business.

               BUTCH'S POV: Vincent hugging and kissing the obscured figure 
               that is Marsellus.

               Butch makes the wise decision that is this asshole's a friend 
               of Marsellus, he better let it go  for now.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE (O.S.)
                         Pack of Red Apples, dollar-forty.

               Butch is snapped out of his ass-kicking thoughts. He pays 
               English Dave and walks out of the SHOT.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. LANCE'S HOUSE (KITCHEN)  NIGHT

               CLOSEUP  JODY

               A woman who appears to have a fondness for earrings. Both of 
               her ears are pierced five times. She also sports rings in 
               her lips, eyebrows and nose.

                                     JODY
                         ...I'll lend it to you. It's a great 
                         book on body piercing.

               Jody, Vincent and a young woman named TRUDI sit at the kitchen 
               table of a suburban house in Echo Park. Even though Vince is 
               at the same table, he's not included in the conversation.

                                     TRUDI
                         You know how they use that gun when 
                         they pierce your ears? They don't 
                         use that when they pierce your 
                         nipples, do they?

                                     JODY
                         Forget that gun. That gun goes against 
                         the entire idea behind piercing. All 
                         of my piercing, sixteen places on my 
                         body, every one of 'em done with a 
                         needle. Five in each ear. One through 
                         the nipple on my left breast. One 
                         through my right nostril.  One through 
                         my left eyebrow. One through my lip. 
                         One in my clit. And I wear a stud in 
                         my tongue.

               Vince has been letting this conversation go through one ear 
               and out the other, until that last remark.

                                     VINCENT
                              (interrupting)
                         Excuse me, sorry to interrupt. I'm 
                         curious, why would you get a stud in 
                         your tongue?

               Jody looks at him and says as if it were the most obvious 
               thing in the world.

                                     JODY
                         It's a sex thing. It helps fellatio.

               That thought never occurred to Vincent, but he can't deny it 
               makes sense. Jody continues talking to Trudi, leaving Vincent 
               to ponder the truth of her statement.

               INT. LANCE'S BEDROOM  NIGHT

               Lance, late 20s, is a young man with a wild and woolly 
               appearance that goes hand-in-hand with his wild and woolly 
               personality. LANCE has been selling drugs his entire adult 
               life. He's never had a day job, never filed a tax return and 
               has never been arrested. He wears a red flannel shirt over a 
               "Speed Racer" tee-shirt.

               Three bags of heroin lie on Lance's bed.

               Lance and Vincent stand at the foot of the bed.

               Vincent takes his works out of his case and, as the two

               EXT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S  NIGHT

               In the past six years, 50's diners have sprung up all over 
               L.A., giving Thai restaurants a run for their money. They're 
               all basically the same. Decor out of an "Archie" comic book, 
               Golden Oldies constantly emanating from a bubbly Wurlitzer, 
               saucy waitresses in bobby socks, menus with items like the 
               Fats Domino Cheeseburger, or the Wolfman Jack Omelet, and 
               over prices that pay for all this bullshit.

               But then there's JACKRABBIT SLIM'S, the big mama of 50's 
               diners.

               Either the best or the worst, depending on your point of 
               view.

               Vincent's Malibu pulls up to the restaurant. A big sign with 
               a neon figure of a cartoon surly cool cat jackrabbit in a 
               red windbreaker towers over the establishment. Underneath 
               the cartoon is the name: JACKRABBIT SLIM'S. Underneath that 
               is the slogan: "Next best thing to a time machine."

                                     VINCENT
                         What the fuck is this place?

                                     MIA
                         This is Jackrabbit Slim's. An Elvis 
                         man should love it.

                                     VINCENT
                         Come on, Mia, let's go get a steak.

                                     MIA
                         You can get a steak here, daddy-o. 
                         Don't be a...

               Mia draws a square with her hands. Dotted lines appear on 
               the screen, forming a sqaure. The lines disperse.

                         After you, kitty-cat.

               INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S  NIGHT

               Compared to the interior, the exterior was that of a quaint 
               English pub. Posters from 50's A.I.P. movies are all over 
               the wall

               ("ROCK ALL NIGHT," "HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL," "ATTACK OF 
               THE CRAB MONSTER," and "MACHINE GUN KELLY"). The booths that 
               the patrons sit in are made out of the cut up bodies of 50s 
               cars.

               In the middle of the restaurant in a dance floor. A big sign 
               on the wall states, "No shoes allowed." Some wannabe beboppers 
               (actually Melrose-types), do the twist in their socks or 
               barefeet.

               The picture windows don't look out the street, but instead, 
               B & W movies of 50's street scenes play behind them. The 
               WAITRESSES and WAITERS are made up as replicas of 50's icons: 
               MARILYN MONROE, ZORRO, JAMES DEAN, DONNA REED, MARTIN and 
               LEWIS, and THE PHILIP MORRIS MIDGET, wait on tables wearing 
               appropriate costumes.

               Vincent and Mia study the menu in a booth made out of a red 
               '59 Edsel. BUDDY HOLLY (their waiter), comes over, sporting 
               a big button on his chest that says: "Hi I'm Buddy, pleasing 
               you please me."

                                     BUDDY
                         Hi, I'm Buddy, what can I get'cha?

                         bloody  and a five-dollar shake.

                                     BUDDY
                         How d'ya want that shake, Martin and

                                     BUDDY
                         Yep.

                         You don't put bourbon in it or 
                         anything?

                                     BUDDY
                         Nope.

                         Just checking.

               Buddy exits.

               Vincent takes a look around the place. The YUPPIES are 
               dancing, the DINERS are biting into big, juicy hamburgers, 
               and the icons are playing their parts. Marilyn is squealing, 
               The Midget is paging Philip Morris, Donna Reed is making her 
               customers drink their milk, and Dean and Jerry are acting a 
               fool.

                                     MIA
                         Whaddya think?

                         It's like a wax museum with a pulse 
                         rate.

               Vincent takes out his pouch of tobacco and begins rolling 
               himself a smoke.

               After a second of watching him 

                                     VINCENT
                         It's just tobacco.

                                     MIA
                         Oh. Well in that case, will you roll 
                         me one, cowboy?

               As he finishes licking it 

                                     VINCENT
                         You can have this one, cowgirl.

               He hands her the rolled smoke. She takes it, putting it to 
               her lips. Out of nowhere appears a Zippo lighter in Vincent's 
               hand. He lights it.

                                     MIA
                         Thanks.

                                     VINCENT
                         Think nothing of it.

               He begins rolling one for himself.

               As this time, the SOUND of a subway car fills the diner, 
               making everything SHAKE and RATTLE. Marilyn Monroe runs to a 
               square vent in the floor. An imaginary subway train BLOWS 
               the skirt of her white dress around her ears as she lets out 
               a squeal. The entire restaurant applauds.

               Back to Mia and Vincent.

                                     MIA
                         Marsellus said you just got back 
                         from Amsterdam.

                                     VINCENT
                         Sure did. I heard you did a pilot.

                                     MIA
                         That was my fifteen minutes.

                                     VINCENT
                         What was it?

                                     MIA
                         It was show about a team of female 
                         secret agents called "Fox Force Five."

                                     VINCENT
                         What?

                                     MIA
                         "Fox Force Five." Fox, as in we're a 
                         bunch of foxy chicks. Force, as in 
                         we're a force to be reckoned with. 
                         Five, as in there's one... two ... 
                         three... four... five of us. There 
                         was a blonde one, Sommerset O'Neal 
                         from that show "Baton Rouge," she 
                         was the leader. A Japanese one, a 
                         black one, a French one and a brunette 
                         one, me.  We all had special skills. 
                         Sommerset had a photographic memory, 
                         the Japanese fox was a kung fu master, 
                         the black girl was a demolition 
                         expert, the French fox' specialty 
                         was sex...

                                     VINCENT
                         What was your specialty?

                                     MIA
                         Knives. The character I played, Raven 
                         McCoy, her background was she was 
                         raised by circus performers. So she 
                         grew up doing a knife act. According 
                         to the show, she was the deadliest 
                         woman in the world with a knife. But 
                         because she grew up in a circus, she 
                         was also something of an acrobat. 
                         She could do illusions, she was a 
                         trapeze artist  when you're keeping 
                         the world safe from evil, you never 
                         know when being a trapeze artist's 
                         gonna come in handy. And she knew a 
                         zillion old jokes her grandfather, 
                         an old vaudevillian, taught her. If 
                         we woulda got picked up, they woulda 
                         worked in a gimmick where every 
                         episode I woulda told and ol joke.

                                     VINCENT
                         Do you remember any of the jokes?

                                     MIA
                         Well I only got the chance to say 
                         one, 'cause we only did one show.

                                     VINCENT
                         Tell me.

                                     MIA
                         No. It's really corny.

                                     VINCENT
                         C'mon, don't be that way.

                                     MIA
                         No. You won't like it and I'll be 
                         embarrassed.

                                     VINCENT
                         You told it in front of fifty million 
                         people and you can't tell it to me? 
                         I promise I won't laugh.

                                     MIA
                              (laughing)
                         That's what I'm afraid of.

                                     VINCENT
                         That's not what I meant and you know 
                         it.

                                     MIA
                         You're quite the silver tongue devil, 
                         aren't you?

                                     VINCENT
                         I meant I wouldn't laugh at you.

                                     MIA
                         That's not what you said Vince. Well 
                         now I'm definitely not gonna tell 
                         ya, 'cause it's been built up too 
                         much.

                                     VINCENT
                         What a gyp.

               Buddy comes back with the drinks. Mia wraps her lips around 
               the straw of her shake.

                                     MIA
                         Yummy!

                                     VINCENT
                         Can I have a sip of that? I'd like 
                         to know what a five-dollar shake 
                         tastes like.

                                     MIA
                         Be my guest.

               She slides the shake over to him.

                                     MIA
                         You can use my straw, I don't have 
                         kooties.

               Vincent smiles.

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah, but maybe I do.

                                     MIA
                         Kooties I can handle.

               He takes a sip.

                                     VINCENT
                         Goddamn! That's a pretty fuckin' 
                         good milk shake.

                                     MIA
                         Told ya.

                                     VINCENT
                         I don't know if it's worth five 
                         dollars, but it's pretty fuckin' 
                         good.

               He slides the shake back.

               Then the first of an uncomfortable silence happens.

                                     MIA
                         Don't you hate that?

                                     VINCENT
                         What?

                                     MIA
                         Uncomfortable silences. Why do we 
                         feel it's necessary to yak about 
                         bullshit in order to be comfortable?

                                     VINCENT
                         I don't know.

                                     MIA
                         That's when you know you found 
                         somebody special. When you can just 
                         shit the fuck up for a minute, and 
                         comfortably share silence.

                                     VINCENT
                         I don't think we're there yet. But 
                         don't feel bad, we just met each 
                         other.

                                     MIA
                         Well I'll tell you what, I'll go to 
                         the bathroom and powder my nose, 
                         while you sit here and think of 
                         something to say.

                                     VINCENT
                         I'll do that.

               INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (LADIES ROOM)  NIGHT

               Mia powders her nose by doing a big line of coke off the 
               bathroom sink. Her head jerks up from the rush.

                                     MIA
                              (imitating Steppenwolf)
                         I said goddamn!

               INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA)  NIGHT

               Vincent digs into his Douglas Sirk steak. As he chews, his 
               eyes scan the Hellsapopinish restaurant.

               Mia comes back to the table.

                                     MIA
                         Don't you love it when you go to the 
                         bathroom and you come back to find 
                         your food waiting for you?

                                     VINCENT
                         We're lucky we got it at all. Buddy 
                         Holly doesn't seem to be much of a 
                         waiter. We shoulda sat in Marilyn 
                         Monroe's section.

                                     MIA
                         Which one, there's two Marilyn 
                         Monroes.

                                     VINCENT
                         No there's not.

               Pointing at Marilyn in the white dress serving a table.

                                     VINCENT
                         That's Marilyn Monroe...

               Then, pointing at a BLONDE WAITRESS in a tight sweater and 
               capri pants, taking an order from a bunch of FILM GEEKS 

                                     VINCENT
                         ... and that's Mamie Van Doren. I 
                         don't see Jayne Mansfield, so it 
                         must be her night off.

                                     MIA
                         Pretty smart.

                                     VINCENT
                         I have moments.

                                     MIA
                         Did ya think of something to say?

                                     VINCENT
                         Actually, there's something I've 
                         wanted to ask you about, but you 
                         seem like a nice person, and I didn't 
                         want to offend you.

                                     MIA
                         Oooohhhh, this doesn't sound like 
                         mindless, boring, getting-to-know-
                         you chit-chat. This sounds like you 
                         actually have something to say.

                                     VINCENT
                         Only if you promise not to get 
                         offended.

                                     MIA
                         You can't promise something like 
                         that. I have no idea what you're 
                         gonna ask. You could ask me what 
                         you're gonna ask me, and my natural 
                         response could be to be offended. 
                         Then, through no fault of my own, I 
                         woulda broken my promise.

                                     VINCENT
                         Then let's just forget it.

                                     MIA
                         That is an impossibility. Trying to 
                         forget anything as intriguing as 
                         this would be an exercise in futility.

                                     VINCENT
                         Is that a fact?

               Mia nods her head: "Yes."

                                     MIA
                         Besides, it's more exciting when you 
                         don't have permission.

                                     VINCENT
                         What do you think about what happened 
                         to Antwan?

                                     MIA
                         Who's Antwan?

                                     VINCENT
                         Tony Rocky Horror.

                                     MIA
                         He fell out of a window.

                                     VINCENT
                         That's one way to say it. Another 
                         way is, he was thrown out. Another 
                         was is, he was thrown out by 
                         Marsellus. And even another way is, 
                         he was thrown out of a window by 
                         Marsellus because of you.

                                     MIA
                         Is that a fact?

                                     VINCENT
                         No it's not, it's just what I heard.

                                     MIA
                         Who told you this?

                                     VINCENT
                         They.

               Mia and Vincent smile.

                                     MIA
                         They talk a lot, don't they?

                                     VINCENT
                         They certainly do.

                                     MIA
                         Well don't by shy Vincent, what 
                         exactly did they say?

               Vincent is slow to answer.

                                     MIA
                         Let me help you Bashful, did it 
                         involve the F-word?

                                     VINCENT
                         No. They just said Rocky Horror gave 
                         you a foot massage.

                                     MIA
                         And...?

                                     VINCENT
                         No and, that's it.

                                     MIA
                         You heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horror 
                         out of a four-story window because 
                         he massaged my feet?

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah.

                                     MIA
                         And you believed that?

                                     VINCENT
                         At the time I was told, it seemed 
                         reasonable.

                                     MIA
                         Marsellus throwing Tony out of a 
                         four story window for giving me a 
                         foot massage seemed reasonable?

                                     VINCENT
                         No, it seemed excessive. But that 
                         doesn't mean it didn't happen. I 
                         heard Marsellus is very protective 
                         of you.

                                     MIA
                         A husband being protective of his 
                         wife is one thing. A husband almost 
                         killing another man for touching his 
                         wife's feet is something else.

                                     VINCENT
                         But did it happen?

                                     MIA
                         The only thing Antwan ever touched 
                         of mine was my hand, when he shook 
                         it. I met Anwan once  at my wedding 
                          then never again.  The truth is, 
                         nobody knows why Marsellus tossed 
                         Tony Rocky Horror out of that window 
                         except Marsellus and Tony Rocky 
                         Horror. But when you scamps get 
                         together, you're worse than a sewing 
                         circle.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         ...One lucky couple will win this 
                         handsome trophy that Marilyn here is 
                         holding.

               Marilyn holds the trophy.

                         ...Now, who will be our first 
                         contestants?

               Mia holds her hand.

                                     MIA
                         Right here.

               Vincent reacts.

                                     MIA
                         I wanna dance.

                                     VINCENT
                         No, no, no no, no, no, no, no.

                                     MIA
                              (overlapping)
                         No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I do 
                         believe Marsellus, my husband, your 
                         boss, told you to take me out and do 
                         whatever I wanted, Now, I want to 
                         dance. I want to win. I want that 
                         trophy.

                                     VINCENT
                              (sighs)
                         All right.

                                     MIA
                         So, dance good.

                                     VINCENT
                         All right, you asked for it.

               Vincent and Mia walk onto the dance floor, toward Ed Sullivan.

                                     ED SULLIVAN
                              (into microphone)
                         Let's hear it for our first 
                         contestants.

               Patrons cheer.

               Vincent and Mia walk up to the microphone.

                                     ED SULLIVAN
                         Now let's meet our first contestants 
                         here this evening. Young lady, what 
                         is your name?

                                     MIA
                              (into microphone)
                         Missus Mia Wallace.

                              (into microphone)
                         And, uh, how 'bout your fella here?

                                     MIA
                              (into microphone)
                         Vincent Vega.

                                     ED SULLIVAN
                              (into microphone)
                         All right, let's see what you can 
                         do. Take it away!

               Mia and Vincent dance to Chuck Berry's "YOU NEVER CAN TELL". 
               They make hand movements as they dance.

               INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOME  NIGHT

               The front door FLINGS open, and Mia and Vincent dance tango-
               style into the house, singing a cappella the song from the 
               previous scene. They finish their little dance, laughing.

               Then...

               The two just stand face to face looking at each other.

                                     VINCENT
                         Was than an uncomfortable silence?

                                     MIA
                         I don't know what that was.
                              (pause)
                         Music and drinks!

               Mia moves away to attend to both. Vincent hangs up his 
               overcoat on a big bronze coat rack in the alcove.

                                     VINCENT
                         I'm gonna take a piss.

                                     MIA
                         That was a little bit more information 
                         than I needed to know, but go right 
                         ahead.

               Vincent shuffles off to the john.

               Mia moves to her CD player, thumbs through a stack of CDs 
               and selects one: k.d. lang. The speakers BLAST OUT a high 
               energy country number, which Mia plays air-guitar to. She 
               dances her way around the room and finds herself by Vincent's 
               overcoat hanging on the rack. She touches its sleeve. It 
               feels good.

               Her hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch. 
               Like a little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco 
               on some rolling paper. Imitating what he did earlier, licks 
               the paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette. Maybe a 
               little too fat, but not bad for a first try. Mia thinks so 
               anyway. Her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out 
               his Zippo lighter. She SLAPS the lighter against her leg, 
               trying to light it fancy-style like Vince did. What do you 
               know, she did it! Mia's one happy clam. She triumphantly 
               brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it up, 
               then LOUDLY SNAPS the Zippo closed.

               The Mia-made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she 
               takes a long, cool drag. Her hand slides the Zippo back in 
               the overcoat pocket. But wait, her fingers touch something 
               else. Those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder 
               inside, the madman that Vincent bought earlier from Lance. 
               Wearing a big smile, Mia brings the bag of heroin up to her 
               face.

                                     MIA
                              (like you would say 
                              Bingo!)
                         Disco! Vince, you little cola nut, 
                         you've been holding out on me.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BATHROOM (MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE)  NIGHT

               Vincent stands at the sink, washing his hands, talking to 
               himself in the mirror.

                                     VINCENT
                         One drink and leave. Don't be rude, 
                         but drink your drink quickly, say 
                         goodbye, walk out the door, get in 
                         your car, and go down the road.

               LIVING ROOM

               Mia has the unbeknownst-to-her heroin cut up into big lines 
               on her glass top coffee table. Taking her trusty hundred 
               dollar bill like a human Dust-Buster, she quickly snorts the 
               fat line.

               CLOSEUP  MIA

               Her head JERKS back. Her hands go to her nose (which feels 
               like it's on fucking fire), something is terribly wrong. 
               Then... the rush hits...

               BATHROOM

               Vincent dries his hands on a towel while he continues his 
               dialogue with the mirror.

                                     VINCENT
                         ...It's a moral test of yourself, 
                         whether or not you can maintain 
                         loyalty. Because when people are 
                         loyal to each other, that's very 
                         meaningful.

               LIVING ROOM

               Mia is on all fours trying to crawl to the bathroom, but 
               it's like she's trying to crawl with the bones removed from 
               her knees. Blood begins to drip from Mia's nose. Then her 
               stomach gets into the act and she VOMITS.

               BATHROOM

               Vince continues.

                                     VINCENT
                         So you're gonna go out there, drink 
                         your drink, say "Goodnight, I've had 
                         a very lovely evening," go home, and 
                         jack off.  And that's all you're 
                         gonna do.

               Now that he's given himself a little pep talk, Vincent's 
               ready for whatever's waiting for him on the other side of 
               that door. So he goes through it.

               LIVING ROOM

               We follow behind Vincent as he walks from the bathroom to 
               the living room, where he finds Mia lying on the floor like 
               a rag doll. She's twisted on her back. Blood and puke are 
               down her front. And her face is contorted. Not out of the 
               tightness of pain, but just the opposite, the muscles in her 
               face are so relaxed, she lies still with her mouth wide open. 
               Slack-jawed.

                                     VINCENT
                         Jesus Christ!

               Vincent moves like greased lightning to Mia's fallen body. 
               Bending down where she lays, he puts his fingers on her neck 
               to check her pulse. She slightly stirs.

               Mia is aware of Vincent over her, speaking to her.

                                     VINCENT
                              (sounding weird)
                         Mia! MIA! What the hell happened?

               But she's unable to communicate Mia makes a few lost mumbles, 
               but they're not distinctive enough to be called words.

               Vincent props her eyelids open and sees the story.

                                     VINCENT
                              (to himself)
                         I'll be a son-of-a-bitch.
                              (to Mia)
                         Mia! MIA! What did you take? Answer 
                         me honey, what did you take?

               Mia is incapable of answering. He SLAPS her face hard.

               Vincent SPRINGS up and RUNS to his overcoat, hanging on the 
               rack.

               He goes through the pockets FRANTICALLY. It's gone. Vincent 
               makes a beeline to Mia. We follow.

                                     VINCENT
                              (yelling to Mia)
                         Okay honey, we're getting you on 
                         your feet.

               He reaches her and hoists the dead weight up in his arms.

                                     VINCENT
                         We're on our feet now, and now we're 
                         gonna talk out to the car. Here we 
                         go, watch us walk.

               We follow behind as he hurriedly walks the practically-
               unconscious Mia through the house and out the front door.

               EXT. VINCENT'S HOT ROD (MOVING)  NIGHT

               INSERT SPEEDOMETER: red needle on a hundred.

               Vincent driving like a madman in a town without traffic laws, 
               speeds the car into turns and up and over hills.

               INT.VINCENT'S HOT ROD (MOVING)  NIGHT

               Vincent, one hand firmly on the wheel, the other shifting 
               like Robocop, both eyes staring straight ahead except when 
               he glances over at Mia.

               Mia, slack-jawed expression, mouth gaping, posture of a bag 
               of water.

               Vincent takes a cellular phone out of his pocket. He punches 
               a number.

               INT. LANCE'S HOUSE  NIGHT

               At this late hour, LANCE has transformed from a bon vivant 
               drug dealer to a bathrobe creature.

               He sits in a big comfy chair, ratty blue gym pants, a worn-
               out but comfortable tee-shirt that has, written on it, "TAFT, 
               CALIFORNIA", and a moth-ridden terry cloth robe. In his hand 
               is a bowl of Cap'n Crunch with Crunch Berries. In front of 
               him on the coffee table is a jug of milk, the box the Cap'n 
               Crunch with Crunch Berries came out of, and a hash pipe in 
               an ashtray.

               On the big-screen TV in front of the table is the Three 
               Stooges, and they're getting married.

                                     PREACHER (EMIL SIMKUS)
                              (on TV)
                         Hold hands, you love birds.

               The phone RINGS.

               Lance puts down his cereal and makes his way to the phone.

               It RINGS again.

               Jody, his wife, CALLS from the bedroom, obviously woken up.

                                     JODY (O.S.)
                         Lance! The phone's ringing!

                                     LANCE
                              (calling back)
                         I can hear it!

                                     JODY (O.S.)

                         assholes never to call this late!

                                     LANCE
                              (by the phone)
                         I told 'em and that's what I'm gonna 
                         tell this fuckin' asshole right now!
                              (he answers the phone)
                         Hello, do you know how late it is? 
                         You're not supposed to be callin' me 
                         this fuckin' late.

                                                                   BACK TO:

               VINCENT IN THE MALIBU

               Vincent is still driving like a stripe-assed ape, clutching 
               the phone to his ear. WE CUT BACK AND FORTH during the 
               conversation.

                                     VINCENT

                                     VINCENT
                         Negative.

                                     LANCE
                         She ain't my fuckin' problem, you 
                         fucked her up, you deal with it  
                         are you talkin' to me on a cellular 
                         phone?

                                     VINCENT
                         Sorry.

                                     LANCE
                         I don't know you, who is this, don't 
                         come here, I'm hangin' up.

                                     VINCENT
                         Too late, I'm already here.

               At that moment inside Lance's house, WE HEAR VINCENT's Malibu 
               coming up the street. Lance hangs up the phone, goes to his 
               curtains and YANKS the cord. The curtains open with a WHOOSH 
               in time to see Vincent's Malibu DRIVING UP on his front lawn 
               and CRASHING into his house. The window Lance is looking out 
               of SHATTERS from the impact.

                                     JODY (O.S.)
                         What the hell was that?

               Lance CHARGES from the window, out the door to his front 
               lawn.

               EXT. LANCE'S HOUSE  NIGHT

               Vincent is already out of the car, working on getting Mia 
               out.

                         Wallace's wife. Now if she fuckin' 
                         croaks on me, I'm a grease spot. But 
                         before he turns me into a bar soap,

                         how you coulda saved her life, but 
                         instead you let her die on your front 
                         lawn.

               INT. LANCE'S HOUSE  NIGHT

               WE START in Lance's and Jody's bedroom.

               Jody, in bed, throws off the covers and stands up. She's 
               wearing a long tee-shirt with a picture of Fred Flintstone 
               on it.

               We follow HANDHELD behind her as she opens the door, walking 
               through the hall into the living room.

                                     JODY
                         It's only one-thirty in the goddamn 
                         mornin'! What the fuck's goin' on 
                         out here?

               As she walks in the living room, she sees Vincent and Lance 
               standing over Mia, who's lying on the floor in the middle of 
               the room.

               From here on in, everything in this scene is frantic, like a 
               DOCUMENTARY in an emergency ward, with the big difference 
               here being nobody knows what the fuck they're doing.

                                     JODY
                         Who's she?

               Lance looks up at Jody.

                                     LANCE
                         Get that black box in the bedroom I

                         What's wrong with her?

                                     VINCENT
                         She's ODing on us.

                                     JODY
                         Well get her the hell outta here!

                                     LANCE AND VINCENT
                              (in stereo)

                         Don't yell and me!

               She angrily turns and disappears into the bedroom looking 
               for the shot.

               WE MOVE into the room with the two men.

                                     VINCENT

               WE FOLLOW Lance as he runs out of the living room into a...

               INT. SPARE ROOM

               With a bunch of junk in it. He frantically starts scanning 
               the junk for the book he's looking for, repeating the words, 
               "Come on," endlessly.

               From OFF SCREEN we hear:

                         Hurry up man! We're losin' her!

                                     LANCE
                              (calling back)
                         I'm looking as fast as I can!

               Lance continues his frenzied search.

               WE HEAR Jody in the living room now as she talks to Vincent.

                                     JODY (O.S.)
                         What's he lookin' for?

                                     VINCENT (O.S.)
                         I dunno, some medical book.

               Jody calls to LANCE.

                                     JODY (O.S.)
                         What are you lookin' for?

                                     LANCE
                         My black medical book!

               As he continues searching, flipping and knocking over shit, 
               Jody appears in the doorway.

                                     JODY
                         Whata're you looking for?

                                     LANCE
                         My black fuckin' medical book. It's 
                         like a text book they give to nurses.

                                     JODY
                         I never saw a medical book.

                         Trust me, I have one.

                                     JODY
                         Well if it's that important, why 
                         didn't you keep it with the shot?

               Lance spins toward her.

                                     LANCE
                         I don't know! Stop bothering me!

                                     JODY
                         While you're lookin' for it, that 
                         girl's gonna die on our carpet. You're 
                         never gonna find it in all this shit.  
                         For six months now, I've been telling 
                         you to clean this room 

                                     VINCENT (O.S.)
                          get your ass in here, fuck the 
                         book!

               Lance angrily knocks over a pile of shit and leaves the SHOT 
               heading for the living room.

               LIVING ROOM

               Vincent is bent over Mia, talking softly to her, when Lance 
               reenters the room.

                                     VINCENT
                         Quit fuckin' around man and give her 
                         the shot!

               Lance bends down by the black case brought in by Jody. He 
               opens it and begins preparing the needle for injection.

                                     LANCE
                         While I'm doing this, take her shirt 
                         off and find her heart.

               Vince rips her blouse open.

               Jody stumbles back in the room, hanging back from the action.

                                     VINCENT
                         Does it have to be exact?

                                     LANCE
                         Yeah, it has to be exact! I'm giving 
                         her an injection in the heart, so I 
                         gotta exactly hit her in the heart.

                                     VINCENT
                         Well, I don't know exactly where her 
                         heart is, I think it's here.

               Vince points to Mia's right breast.  Lance glances over and 
               nods.

                                     LANCE
                         That's it.

               As Lance readies the injection, Vincent looks up at Jody.

                                     VINCENT
                         I need a big fat magic marker, got 
                         one?

                                     JODY
                         What?

                                     VINCENT
                         I need a big fat magic marker, any 
                         felt pen'll do, but a magic marker 
                         would be great.

                                     JODY
                         Hold on.

               Jody runs to the desk, opens the top drawer and, in her 
               enthusiasm, she pulls the drawer out of the desk, the contents 
               of which (bills, papers, pens) spill to the floor.

               The injection is ready. Lance hands Vincent the needle.

                                     LANCE
                         It's ready, I'll tell you what to 
                         do.

                                     VINCENT
                         You're gonna give her the shot.

                                     LANCE
                         No, you're gonna give her the shot.

                                     VINCENT
                         I've never does this before.

                                     LANCE
                         I've never done this before either, 
                         and I ain't starting now. You brought 
                         'er here, that means you give her 
                         the shot. The day I bring an ODing 
                         bitch to your place, then I gotta 
                         give her the shot.

               Jody hurriedly joins them in the huddle, a big fat red magic 
               marker in her hand.

                                     JODY
                         Got it.

               Vincent grabs the magic marker out of Jody's hand and makes 
               a big red dot on Mia's body where her heart is.

                                     VINCENT
                         Okay, what do I do?

                                     LANCE
                         Well, you're giving her an injection 
                         of adrenaline straight to her heart. 
                         But she's got a breast plate in front 
                         of her heart, so you gotta pierce 
                         through that. So what you gotta do 
                         is bring the needle down in a stabbing 
                         motion.

               Lance demonstrates a stabbing motion, which looks like "The 
               Shape" killing its victims in "HALLOWEEN".

                                     VINCENT
                         I gotta stab her?

                                     LANCE
                         If you want the needle to pierce 
                         through to her heart, you gotta stab 
                         her hard.

               Then once you do, push down on the plunger.

                                     VINCENT
                         What happens after that?

                                     LANCE
                         I'm curious about that myself.

                                     VINCENT
                         This ain't a fuckin' joke man!

                                     LANCE
                         She's supposed to come out of it 
                         like 
                              (snaps his fingers)
                          that.

               Vincent lifts the needle up above his head in a stabbing 
               motion.

               He looks down on Mia.

               Mia is fading fast. Soon nothing will help her.

               Vincent's eyes narrow, ready to do this.

                                     VINCENT
                         Count to three.

               Lance, on this knees right beside Vincent, does not know 
               what to expect.

                                     LANCE
                         One...

               RED DOT on Mia's body.

               Needle raised ready to strike.

                                     LANCE (O.S.)
                         ...two...

               Jody's face is alive with anticipation.

               NEEDLE in that air, poised like a rattler ready to strike.

                                     LANCE (O.S.)
                         ...three!

               The needle leaves frame, THRUSTING down hard.

               Vincent brings the needle down hard, STABBING Mia in the 
               chest.

               Mia's head is JOLTED from the impact.

               The syringe plunger is pushed down, PUMPING the adrenaline 
               out through the needle.

               Mia's eyes POP WIDE OPEN and she lets out a HELLISH cry of 
               the banshee. She BOLTS UP in a sitting position, needle stuck 
               in her chest  SCREAMING.

               Vincent, Lance and Jody, who were in sitting positions in 
               front of Mia, JUMP BACK, scared to death.

               Mia's scream runs out. She slowly starts taking breaths of 
               air.

               The other three, now scooted halfway across the room, shaken 
               to their bones, look to see if she's alright.

                                     LANCE
                         If you're okay, say something.

               Mia, still breathing, not looking up at them, says in a 
               relatively normal voice.

                                     MIA
                         Something.

               Vincent and Lance collapse on their backs, exhausted and 
               shaking from how close to death Mia came.

                                     JODY
                         Anybody want a beer?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. VINCENT'S MALIBU (MOVING)  NIGHT

               Vincent is behind the wheel driving Mia home. No one says 
               anything, both are still too shaken.

               EXT. FRONT OF MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE  NIGHT

               The Malibu pulls up to the front. Mia gets out without saying 
               a word (still in a daze) and begins walking down the walkway 
               toward her front door.

                                     VINCENT (O.S.)
                         Mia!

               She turns around.

               Vincent's out of the car, standing on the walkway, a big 
               distance between the two.

                                     VINCENT
                         What are your thoughts on how to 
                         handle this?

                                     MIA
                         What's yours?

                                     VINCENT
                         Well I'm of the opinion that Marsellus 
                         can live his whole live and never 
                         ever hear of this incident.

               Mia smiles.

                                     MIA
                         Don't worry about it. If Marsellus 
                         ever heard of this, I'd be in as 
                         much trouble as you.

                                     VINCENT
                         I seriously doubt that.

                                     MIA
                         If you can keep a secret, so can I.

                                     VINCENT
                         Let's shake on it.

               The two walk toward each other, holding out their hands to 
               shake and shake they do.

                                     VINCENT
                         Mum's the word.

               Mia lets go of Vincent's hand and silently makes the see-no-
               evil, hear-no-evil, and speak-no-evil sign with her hands.

               Vincent smiles.

                                     VINCENT
                         If you'll excuse me, I gotta go home 
                         and have a heart attack.

               Mia giggles.

               Vincent turns to leave.

                                     MIA
                         You still wanna hear my "FOX FORCE 
                         FIVE" joke?

               Vincent turns around.

                                     VINCENT
                         Sure, but I think I'm still a little 
                         too petrified to laugh.

                                     MIA
                         Uh-huh. You won't laugh because it's 
                         not funny. But if you still wanna 
                         hear it, I'll tell it.

                                     VINCENT
                         I can't wait.

                         Three tomatoes are walking down the 
                         street, a poppa tomato, a momma 
                         tomato, and a little baby tomato. 
                         The baby tomato is lagging behind 
                         the poppa and momma tomato. The poppa 
                         tomato gets mad, goes over to the 
                         momma tomato and stamps on him 
                              (stamps on the ground)
                          and says: catch up.

               They both smile, but neither laugh.

               BUTCH'S POV

               We're in the living room of a modest two bedroom house in 
               Alhambra, California, in the year 1972. BUTCH'S MOTHER, 35ish, 
               stands in the doorway leading into the living room. Next to 
               her is a man dressed in the uniform of an American Air Force 
               officer. The CAMERA is the perspective of a five-year old 
               boy.

                                     MOTHER
                         Butch, stop watching TV a second. We 
                         got a special visitor. Now do you 
                         remember when I told you your daddy 
                         dies in a P.O.W. camp?

                                     BUTCH (O.S.)
                         Uh-huh.

                                     MOTHER
                         Well this here is Capt. Koons. He 
                         was in the P.O.W. camp with Daddy.

               CAPT. KOONS steps inside the room toward the little boy and 
               bends down on one knee to bring him even with the boy's 
               eyeline. When Koons speaks, he speaks with a slight Texas 
               accent.

                                     CAPT. KOONS
                         Hello, little man. Boy I sure heard 
                         a bunch about you. See, I was a good 
                         friend of your Daddy's. We were in 
                         that Hanoi pit of hell over five 
                         years together.  Hopefully, you'll 
                         never have to experience this 
                         yourself, but when two men are in a 
                         situation like me and your Daddy 
                         were, for as long as we were, you 
                         take on certain responsibilities of 
                         the other. If it had been me who had 
                         not made it, Major Coolidge would be 
                         talkin' right now to my son Jim. But 
                         the way it worked out is I'm talkin' 
                         to you, Butch. I got somethin' for 
                         ya.

               The Captain pulls a gold wrist watch out of his pocket.

                                     CAPT. KOONS
                         This watch I got here was first 
                         purchased by your great-granddaddy. 
                         It was bought during the First World 
                         War in a little general store in 
                         Knoxville, Tennessee. It was bought 
                         by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge 
                         the day he set sail for Paris. It 
                         was your great-granddaddy's war watch, 
                         made by the first company to ever 
                         make wrist watches. You see, up until 
                         then, people just carried pocket 
                         watches. Your great-granddaddy wore 
                         that watch every day he was in the 
                         war. Then when he had done his duty, 
                         he went home to your great-
                         grandmother, took the watch off his 
                         wrist and put it in an ol' coffee 
                         can. And in that can it stayed 'til 
                         your grandfather Dane Coolidge was 
                         called upon by his country to go 
                         overseas and fight the Germans once 
                         again. This time they called it World 
                         War Two. Your great-granddaddy gave 
                         it to your granddad for good luck.  
                         Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as 
                         good as his old man's. Your granddad 
                         was a Marine and he was killed with 
                         all the other Marines at the battle 
                         of Wake Island. Your granddad was 
                         facing death and he knew it. None of 
                         those boys had any illusions about 
                         ever leavin' that island alive. So 
                         three days before the Japanese took 
                         the island, your 22-year old 
                         grandfather asked a gunner on an Air 
                         Force transport named Winocki, a man 
                         he had never met before in his life, 
                         to deliver to his infant son, who he 
                         had never seen in the flesh, his 
                         gold watch. Three days later, your 
                         grandfather was dead. But Winocki 
                         kept his word. After the war was 
                         over, he paid a visit to your 
                         grandmother, delivering to your infant 
                         father, his Dad's gold watch. This 
                         watch. This watch was on your Daddy's 
                         wrist when he was shot down over 
                         Hanoi. He was captured and put in a 
                         Vietnamese prison camp. Now he knew 
                         if the gooks ever saw the watch it'd 
                         be confiscated. The way your Daddy 
                         looked at it, that watch was your 
                         birthright. And he'd be damned if 
                         and slopeheads were gonna put their 
                         greasy yella hands on his boy's 
                         birthright. So he hid it in the one 
                         place he knew he could hide somethin'. 
                         His ass. Five long years, he wore 
                         this watch up his ass. Then when he 
                         died of dysentery, he gave me the 
                         watch. I hid with uncomfortable hunk 
                         of metal up my ass for two years. 
                         Then, after seven years, I was sent 
                         home to my family. And now, little 
                         man, I give the watch to you.

               Capt. Koons hands the watch to Butch. A little hand comes 
               into FRAME to accept it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LOCKER ROOM  NIGHT

               The 27-year old Butch Coolidge is dressed in boxing regalia: 
               trunks, shoes and gloves. He lies on a table catching a few 
               zzzzzz's before his big fight. Almost as soon as WE CUT to 
               him, he wakes up with a start. Shaken by the bizarre memory, 
               he wipes his sweaty face with his boxing glove.

               His trainer KLONDIKE, an older fireplug, opens the door a 
               little, sticking his head in the room. Pandemonium seems to 
               be breaking out behind Klondike in the hallway.

                                     KLONDIKE
                         It's time, Butch.

                                     BUTCH
                         I'm ready.

               Klondike steps inside, closing the door on the WILD MOB 
               outside.

               He goes to the long yellow robe hanging on a hook. Butch 
               hops off the table and, without a word, Klondike helps him 
               on with the robe, which says on the back: "BATTLING BUTCH 
               COOLIDGE".

               The two men head for the door. Klondike opens the door for 
               Butch.

               As Butch steps into the hallway, the Crowd goes apeshit. 
               Klondike closes the door behind him, leaving us in the quiet, 
               empty locker room.

               A taxi is parked in a dark alley next to an auditorium. The 
               sky is PISSIN' DOWN RAIN. WE SLOWLY DOLLY toward the parked 
               car. The SOUND of the CAR RADIO can be heard coming from 
               inside.

                         than I've ever seen a victorious 
                         boxer vacate the ring. Do you think 
                         he knew Willis was dead?

                         My guess would be yes, Richard. I 
                         could see from my position here, the 
                         frenzy in his eyes give way to the 
                         realization of what he was doing. I 
                         think any man would've left the ring 
                         that fast.

                         help but shake the world of boxing 
                         to its very foundation. But it's of 
                         paramount importance that during the

               She takes a sip of coffee, then hears a NOISE behind her in 
               the alley. She sticks her head out of the car door to see:

               EXT. BOXING AUDITORIUM (RAINING)  NIGHT

               A window about three stories high opens on the auditorium-
               side of the alley. A gym bag is tossed out into a garbage 
               dumpster below the window. Then, Butch Coolidge, still dressed 
               in boxing trunks, shoes, gloves and yellow robe, LEAPS to 
               the dumpster below.

               ESMARELDA'S REACTION takes in the strangeness of this sight.

               Gym bag in hand, Butch CLIMBS out of the dumpster and RUNS 
               to the taxi. Before he climbs in, he takes off his robe and 
               throws it to the ground.

               INT. TAXI (PARKED / RAINING)  NIGHT

               Butch, soaking wet, naked except for trunks, shoes and gloves, 
               HOPS in the backseat, SLAMMING the door.

               Esmarelda, staring straight ahead, talks to Butch through 
               the rearview mirror:

                                     ESMARELDA

                         Are you the man I was supposed to 
                         pick up?

                                     BUTCH
                         If you're the cab I called, I'm the 
                         guy you're supposed to pick up.

                         Where to?

               The cab WHIPS out of the alley, FISH-TAILING on the wet 
               pavement in front of the auditorium at a rapid pace.

                                     MIA
                         Great. I never thanked you for the 
                         dinner.

               In the room, black boxer FLOYD RAY WILLIS lies on a table  
               dead.

               His face looks like he went dunking for bees. His TRAINER is 
               on his knees, head on Floyd's chest, crying over the body.

               The huge figure that is Marsellus Wallace stands at the table, 
               hand on the Trainer's shoulder, lending emotional support. 
               We still do not see Marsellus clearly, only that he is big.

               Mia sits in a chair at the far end of the room.

               Marsellus looks up, sees English Dave and walks over to him.

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)
                         What'cha got?

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         He booked.

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)
                         I'm prepared to scour the earth for 
                         this motherfucker. If Butch goes to 
                         Indo China, I want a nigger hidin' 
                         in a bowl of rice, ready to pop a 
                         cap in his ass.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         I'll take care of it.

               INT. CAB (MOVING / RAINING)  NIGHT

               Butch gets one of his boxing gloves off.

               Esmeralda watches in the rearview mirror.

               He tries to roll down one of the backseat windows, but can't 
               find the roll bar.

                                     BUTCH
                         Hey, how do I open the window back 
                         here?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         I have to do it.

               She presses a button and the back window moves down. Butch 
               tosses his boxing glove out the window, then starts untying 
               the other one.

               Esmeralda can't keep quiet anymore.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         Hey, mister?

                                     BUTCH
                              (still working on the 
                              glove)
                         What?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         You were in that fight? The fight on 
                         the radio  you're the fighter?

               As he tosses his other glove out the window.

                                     BUTCH
                         Whatever gave you that idea?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         No c'mon, you're him, I know you're 
                         him, tell me you're him.

                                     BUTCH
                              (drying himself with 
                              a gym towel)
                         I'm him.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         You killed the other boxing man.

                                     BUTCH
                         He's dead?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         The radio said he was dead.

               He finished wiping himself down.

                                     BUTCH
                              (to himself)
                         Sorry 'bout that, Floyd.

               He tosses the towel out the window.

               Silence, as Butch digs in his bag for a t-shirt.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         What does it feel like?

                                     BUTCH
                              (finds his shirt)
                         What does what feel like?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         Killing a man. Beating another man 
                         to death with your bare hands.

               Butch pulls on his tee-shirt.

                                     BUTCH
                         Are you some kinda weirdo?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         No, it's a subject I have much 
                         interest in. You are the first person 
                         I ever met who has killed somebody. 
                         So, what was it like to kill a man?

                                     BUTCH
                         Tell ya what, you give me one of 
                         them cigarettes, I'll give you an 
                         answer.

               Esmarelda bounces in her seat with excitement.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         Deal!

               Butch leans forward. Esmarelda, keeping her eyes on the road, 
               passes a cigarette back to him. He takes it. Then, still not 
               looking behind her, she brings up her hand, a lit match in 
               it.

               Butch lights his smoke, then blows out the match.

               He takes a long drag.

                                     BUTCH
                         So...

               He looks at her license.

                                     BUTCH
                         ...Esmarelda Villalobos  is that 
                         Mexican?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         The name is Spanish, but I'm 
                         Columbian.

                                     BUTCH
                         It's a very pretty name.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         It mean "Esmarelda of the wolves."

                                     BUTCH
                         That's one hell of a name you got 
                         there, sister.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         Thank you. And what is your name?

                                     BUTCH
                         Butch.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         Butch. What does it mean?

                                     BUTCH
                         I'm an American, our names don't 
                         mean shit. Anyway, moving right along, 
                         what is it you wanna know, Esmarelda?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         I want to know what it feels like to 
                         kill a man 

                                     BUTCH
                          I couldn't tell ya. I didn't know 
                         he was dead 'til you told me he was 
                         dead. Now I know he's dead, do you 
                         wanna know how I feel about it?

               Esmarelda nods her head: "yes."

                                     BUTCH
                         I don't feel the least little bit 
                         bad.

               EXT. PHONE BOOTH (RAINING)  NIGHT

               We DOLLY around a phone booth as Butch talks inside.

                                     BUTCH
                              (into phone)
                         What'd I tell ya, soon as the word 
                         got out a fix was in, the odds would 
                         be outta control. Hey, if he was a 
                         better fighter he's be alive. If he 
                         never laced up his gloves in the 
                         first place, which he never shoulda 
                         done, he'd be alive. Enough about 
                         the poor unfortunate Mr. Floyd, let's 
                         talk about the rich and prosperous 
                         Mr. Butch.  How many bookies you 
                         spread it around with?

                                     (PAUSE)
                         Eight? How long to collect?
                              (pause)
                         So by tomorrow evening, you'll have 
                         it all?
                              (pause)
                         Good news Scotty, real good news  I 
                         understand a few stragglers aside. 
                         Me an'  Fabienne're gonna leave in 
                         the morning. It should take us a 
                         couple days to get into Knoxville. 
                         Next time we see each other, it'll 
                         be on Tennessee time.

               Butch hangs up the phone. He looks at the cab waiting to 
               take him wherever he wants to go.

                                     BUTCH
                              (to himself in French 
                              with English subtitles)
                         Fabienne my love, our adventure 
                         begins.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MOTEL (STOPPED / RAINING)  NIGHT

               Esmeralda's taxi pulled into the motel parking lot. The rain 
               has stopped, but the night is still soaked. Butch gets out, 
               now fully dressed in tee-shirt, jeans and high school athletic 
               jacket. He leans in the driver's side window.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         Forty-five sixty.

               Handing her the money.

                                     BUTCH
                         Merci beaucoup. And here's a little 
                         something for the effort.

               Butch holds up a hundred dollar bill.

               Esmarelda's eyes light up. She goes to take it. Butch holds 
               it out of reach.

                                     BUTCH
                         Now if anybody should ask you about 
                         who your fare was tonight, what're 
                         you gonna tell 'em?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         The truth. Three well-dressed, 
                         slightly toasted, Mexicans.

               He gives her the bill.

                                     BUTCH
                         Bon soir, Esmarelda.

                                     ESMARELDA
                              (in Spanish)
                         Sleep well, Butch.

               He tweaks her nose, she smiles, and he turns and walks away. 
               She drives off.

               INT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX)  NIGHT

               Butch enters and turns on the light.

               Lying curled up on the bed, fully dressed, with her back to 
               us is Butch's French girlfriend, FABIENNE.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Keep the light off.

               Butch flicks the switch back, making the room dark again.

                                     BUTCH
                         Is that better, sugar pop?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Oui. Hard day at the office?

                                     BUTCH
                         Pretty hard. I got into a fight.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Poor baby. Can we make spoons?

               Butch climbs into bed, spooning Fabienne from behind.

               When Butch and Fabienne speak to each other, they speak in 
               babytalk.

                                     FABIENNE
                         I was looking at myself in the mirror.

                                     BUTCH
                         Uh-huh?

                                     FABIENNE
                         I wish I had a pot.

                                     BUTCH
                         You were lookin' in the mirror and 
                         you wish you had some pot?

                                     FABIENNE
                         A pot. A pot belly. Pot bellies are 
                         sexy.

                                     BUTCH
                         Well you should be happy, 'cause you 
                         do.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Shut up, Fatso! I don't have a pot! 
                         I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna 
                         when she did "Lucky Star," it's not 
                         the same thing.

                                     BUTCH
                         I didn't realize there was a 
                         difference between a tummy and a pot 
                         belly.

                                     FABIENNE
                         The difference is huge.

                                     BUTCH
                         You want me to have a pot?

                                     FABIENNE
                         No. Pot bellies make a man look either 
                         oafish, or like a gorilla. But on a 
                         woman, a pot belly is very sexy. The 
                         rest of you is normal. Normal face, 
                         normal legs, normal hips, normal 
                         ass, but with a big, perfectly round 
                         pot belly. If I had one, I'd wear a 
                         tee-shirt two sizes too small to 
                         accentuate it.

                                     BUTCH
                         You think guys would find that 
                         attractive?

                                     FABIENNE
                         I don't give a damn what men find 
                         attractive. It's unfortunate what we 
                         find pleasing to the touch and 
                         pleasing to the eye is seldom the 
                         same.

                                     BUTCH
                         If you a pot belly, I'd punch you in 
                         it.

                                     FABIENNE
                         You'd punch me in my belly?

                                     BUTCH
                         Right in the belly.

                                     FABIENNE
                         I'd smother you. I'd drop it on your 
                         right on your face 'til you couldn't 
                         breathe.

                                     BUTCH
                         You'd do that to me?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Yes!

                                     BUTCH
                         Did you get everything, sugar pop?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Yes, I did.

                                     BUTCH
                         Good job.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Did everything go as planned?

                                     BUTCH
                         You didn't listen to the radio?

                                     FABIENNE
                         I never listen to your fights. Were 
                         you the winner?

                                     BUTCH
                         I won alright.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Are you still retiring?

                                     BUTCH
                         Sure am.

                                     FABIENNE
                         What about the man you fought?

                                     BUTCH
                         Floyd retired too.

                                     FABIENNE
                              (smiling)
                         Really?! He won't be fighting no 
                         more?!

                                     BUTCH
                         Not no more.

                                     FABIENNE
                         So it all worked out in the finish?

                                     BUTCH
                         We ain't at the finish, baby.

               Fabienne rolls over and Butch gets on top of her. They kiss.

                                     FABIENNE
                         We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?

               Butch nods his head: "yes."

                                     FABIENNE
                         If they find us, they'll kill us, 
                         won't they?

               Butch nods his head: "yes."

                                     FABIENNE
                         But they won't find us, will they?

               Butch nods his head: "no."

                                     FABIENNE
                         Do you still want me to go with you?

               Butch nods his head: "yes."

                                     FABIENNE
                         I don't want to be a burden or a 
                         nuisance -

               Butch's hand goes out of frame and starts massaging her 
               crotch.

               Fabienne reacts.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Say it!

                                     BUTCH
                         Fabienne, I want you to be with me.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Forever?

                                     BUTCH
                         ...and ever.

               Fabienne lies her head back.

               Butch continues to massage her crotch.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Do you love me?

                                     BUTCH
                         Oui.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Butch? Will you give me oral pleasure?

               Butch kisses her on the mouth.

                                     BUTCH
                         Will you kiss it?

               She nods her head: "yes."

                                     FABIENNE
                         But you first.

               Butch's head goes down out of frame to carry out the oral 
               pleasure. Fabienne's face is alone in the frame.

                                     FABIENNE
                              (in French, with 
                              English subtitles)
                         Butch my love, the adventure begins.

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

               FADE UP:

               MOTEL ROOM

               Same motel room, except empty. WE HEAR THE SHOWER RUNNING in 
               the bathroom. The CAMERA MOVES to the bathroom doorway. We 
               see Fabienne in a white terry cloth robe that seems to swallow 
               her up.

               She's drying her head with a towel. Butch is inside the shower 
               washing up. We see the outline of his naked body through the 
               smoky glass of the shower door. Steam fills the bathroom. 
               Butch turns the shower off and opens the door, popping his 
               head out.

                                     BUTCH
                         I think I cracked a rib.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Giving me oral pleasure?

                                     BUTCH
                         No retard, from the fight.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Don't call me retard.

                                     BUTCH
                              (in a Mongoloid voice)
                         My name is Fabby! My name is Fabby!

                                     FABIENNE
                         Shut up fuck head! I hate that 
                         Mongoloid voice.

                                     BUTCH
                         Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, I take it 
                         back!  Can I have a towel please, 
                         Miss Beautiful Tulip.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Oh I like that, I like being called 
                         a tulip. Tulip is much better than 
                         Mongoloid.

               She finishes drying her hair and wraps the towel like a turban 
               on her head.

                                     BUTCH
                         I didn't call you a Mongoloid, I 
                         called you a retard, but I took it 
                         back.

               She hands him a towel.

                                     BUTCH
                         Merci beaucoup.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Butch?

                                     BUTCH
                              (drying his head)
                         Yes, lemon pie.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Where are we going to go?

                                     BUTCH
                         I'm not sure yet. Wherever you want. 
                         We're gonna get a lot of money from 
                         this. But it ain't gonna be so much, 
                         we can live like hogs in the fat 
                         house forever. I was thinking we 
                         could go somewhere in the South 
                         Pacific. The kinda money we'll have'll 
                         carry us a long way down there.

                                     FABIENNE
                         So if we wanted, we could live in 
                         Bora Bora?

                                     BUTCH
                         You betcha. And if after awhile you 
                         don't dig Bora Bora, then we can 
                         move over to Tahiti or Mexico.

                                     FABIENNE
                         But I do not speak Spanish.

                                     BUTCH
                         You don't speak Bora Boran either.
                         Besides, Mexican is easy: Donde esta 
                         el zapataria?

                                     FABIENNE
                         What does that mean?

                                     BUTCH
                         Where's the shoe store?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Donde esta el zapataria?

                                     BUTCH
                         Excellent pronunciation. You'll be 
                         my little mama ceta in no time.

               Butch exits the bathroom. We stay on Fabienne as she brushes 
               her teeth.

               Butch keeps on from the other room.

                                     BUTCH (O.S.)
                         Que hora es?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Que hora es?

                                     BUTCH (O.S.)
                         What time is it?

                                     FABIENNE
                         What time is it?

                                     BUTCH (O.S.)
                         Time for bed. Sweet dream, jellybean.

               Fabienne brushes her teeth. We watch her for a moment or 
               two, then she remember something.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Butch.

               She walks out of the bathroom to ask Butch a question, only 
               to find him sound asleep in bed.

               She looks at him for a moment.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Forget it.

               She exits frame, going back in the bathroom. WE STAY on the 
               WIDE SHOT of the unconscious Butch in bed.

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

               FADE UP:

               MOTEL ROOM  MORNING

               SAME SHOT AS BEFORE, the next morning. We find Butch still 
               asleep in bed.

               Fabienne brushes her teeth half in and half out of the 
               bathroom so she can watch TV at the same time. She still 
               wears the terry cloth robe from the night before.

               ON TV: WILLIAM SMITH and a BUNCH OF HELL'S ANGELS are taking 
               on the entire Vietnamese army in the film "THE LOSERS".

               Butch wakes from his sleep, as if a scary monster was chasing 
               him.

               His start startles Fabienne.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Merde! You startled me. Did you have 
                         a bad dream?

               Butch squints down the front of the bed at her, trying to 
               focus.

               Butch, still trying to chase the cobwebs away, sees on TV 
               Hell's Angels tear-assin' through a Vietnamese prison camp.

                                     BUTCH
                         What are you watching?

                                     FABIENNE
                         A motorcycle movie, I'm not sure the 
                         name.

                                     BUTCH
                         Are you watchin' it?

               Fabienne enters the room.

                                     FABIENNE
                         In a way. Why? Would you like for me 
                         to switch it off?

                                     BUTCH
                         Would you please?

               She reaches over and turns off the TV.

                                     BUTCH
                         It's a little too early in the morning 
                         for explosions and war.

                                     FABIENNE
                         What was it about?

                                     BUTCH
                         How should I know, you were the one 
                         watchin' it.

               Fabienne laughs.

                                     FABIENNE
                         No, imbecile, what was your dream 
                         about?

                                     BUTCH
                         Oh, I... don't remember. It's really 
                         rare I remember a dream.

                                     FABIENNE
                         You just woke up from it.

                                     BUTCH
                         Fabienne, I'm not lying to you, I 
                         don't remember.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Well, let's look at the grumpy man 
                         in the morning. I didn't say you 
                         were lying, it's just odd you don't 
                         remember your dreams. I always 
                         remember mine. Did you know you talk 
                         in your sleep?

                                     BUTCH
                         I don't talk in my sleep, do I talk 
                         in my sleep?

                                     FABIENNE
                         You did last night.

                                     BUTCH
                         What did I say?

               Laying on top of him.

                                     FABIENNE
                         I don't know. I couldn't understand 
                         you.

               She kisses Butch.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Why don't you get up and we'll get 
                         some breakfast at that breakfast 
                         place with the pancakes.

                                     BUTCH
                         One more kiss and I'll get up.

               Fabienne gives Butch a sweet long kiss.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Satisfied?

                                     BUTCH
                         Yep.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Then get up, lazy bones.

               Butch climbs out of bed and starts pulling clothes out of 
               the suitcase that Fabienne brought.

                                     BUTCH
                         What time is it?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Almost nine in the morning. What 
                         time does our train arrive?

                                     BUTCH
                         Eleven.

                                     FABIENNE
                         I'm gonna order a big plate of 
                         blueberry pancakes with maple syrup, 
                         eggs over easy, and five sausages.

                                     BUTCH
                              (surprised at her 
                              potential appetite)
                         Anything to drink with that?

               Butch is finished dressing.

                                     FABIENNE
                              (referring to his 
                              clothes)
                         Oh yes, that looks nice. To drink, a 
                         tall glass or orange juice and a 
                         black cup of coffee. After that, I'm 
                         going to have a slice of pie.

               As he goes through the suitcase.

                                     BUTCH
                         Pie for breakfast?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Any time of the day is a good time 
                         for pie. Blueberry pie to go with 
                         the pancakes. And on top, a thin 
                         slice of melted cheese 

                                     BUTCH
                          where's my watch?

                                     FABIENNE
                         It's there.

                                     BUTCH
                         No, it's not. It's not here.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Have you looked?

               By now, Butch is frantically rummaging through the suitcase.

                                     BUTCH
                         Yes I've fuckin' looked!!

               He's now throwing clothes.

                                     BUTCH
                         What the fuck do you think I'm doing?! 
                         Are you sure you got it?

               Fabienne can hardly speak, she's never seen Butch this way.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Uhhh... yes... beside the table drawer 
                         

                                     BUTCH
                          on the little kangaroo.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Yes, it was on your little kangaroo.

                                     BUTCH
                         Well it's not here!

                                     FABIENNE
                              (on the verge of tears)
                         Well it should be!

                                     BUTCH
                         Oh it most definitely should be here, 
                         but it's not. So where is it?

               Fabienne is crying and scared.

               Butch lowers his voice, which only serves to make him more 
               menacing.

                                     BUTCH
                         Fabienne, that was my father's fuckin' 
                         watch. You know what my father went 
                         through to git me that watch?... I 
                         don't wanna get into it right now... 
                         but he went through a lot. Now all 
                         this other shit, you coulda set on 
                         fire, but I specifically reminded 
                         you not to forget my father's watch. 
                         Now think, did you get it?

                                     FABIENNE
                         I believe so...

                                     BUTCH
                         You believe so? You either did, or 
                         you didn't, now which one is it?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Then I did.

                                     BUTCH
                         Are you sure?

                                     FABIENNE
                              (shaking)
                         No.

               Butch freaks out, he punches the air.

               Fabienne SCREAMS and backs into a corner, Butch picks up the 
               motel TV and THROWS IT AGAINST the wall.

               Fabienne SCREAMS IN HORROR.

               Butch looks toward her, suddenly calm.

                                     BUTCH
                              (to Fabienne)
                         No! It's not your fault.
                              (he approached her)
                         You left it at the apartment.

               He bends down in front of the woman who has sunk to the floor.

               He touches her hand, she flinches.

                                     BUTCH
                         If you did leave it at the apartment, 
                         it's not your fault. I had you bring 
                         a bunch of stuff. I reminded you 
                         about it, but I didn't illustrate 
                         how personal the watch was to me. If 
                         all I gave a fuck about was my watch, 
                         I should've told you. You ain't a 
                         mind reader.

               He kisses her hand. Then rises.

               Fabienne is still sniffling.

               Butch goes to the closet.

                                     FABIENNE
                         I'm sorry.

               Butch puts on his high school jacket.

                                     BUTCH
                         Don't be. It just means I won't be 
                         able to eat breakfast with you.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Why does it mean that?

                                     BUTCH
                         Because I'm going back to my apartment 
                         to get my watch.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Won't the gangsters be looking for 
                         you there?

                                     BUTCH
                         That's what I'm gonna find out. If 
                         they are, and I don't think I can 
                         handle it, I'll split.

               Rising from the floor.

                                     FABIENNE
                         I was so dreadful. I saw your watch, 
                         I thought I brought it. I'm so sorry.

               Butch brings her close and puts his hands on her face.

                                     BUTCH
                         Don't feel bad, sugar pop. Nothing 
                         you could ever do would make me 
                         permanently angry at you.
                              (pause)
                         I love you, remember?
                              (he digs some money 
                              out of his wallet)
                         Now here's some money, order those 
                         pancakes and have a great breakfast.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Don't go.

                                     BUTCH
                         I'll be back before you can say, 
                         blueberry pie.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Blueberry pie.

                                     BUTCH
                         Well maybe not that fast, but fast. 
                         Okay?  Okay?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Okay.

               He kisses her once more and heads for the door.

                                     BUTCH
                         Bye-bye, sugar pop.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Bye.

                                     BUTCH
                         I'm gonna take your Honda.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Okay.

               And with that, he's out the door.

               Fabienne sits on the bed and looks at the money he gave her.

               INT. HONDA (MOVING)  DAY

               Butch is beating the steering wheel and the dash with his 
               fists as he drives down the street.

                                     BUTCH
                         Of all the fuckin' things she coulda 
                         forgot, she forgets my father's watch. 
                         I specifically reminded her not to 
                         forget it. "Bedside table  on the 
                         kangaroo." I said the words: "Don't 
                         forget my father's watch."

               EXT. CITY STREET  DAY

               The little Honda races toward its destination as fast as is 
               little engine will take it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A parking meter red flag rises up, then out, leaving the 
               arrow pointing at one hour.

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET CORNER  DAY

               Butch isn't completely reckless. He has parked his car a 
               couple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before 
               he goes boppin' through the front door.

               EXT. ALLEY  DAY

               Butch walks down the alley until he gets to another street, 
               then he discreetly glances out.

               EXT. STREET  BUTCH'S APARTMENT  DAY

               Everything seems normal. More or less the right number of 
               cars in the street. None of the parked cars appear out of 
               place. None of them have a couple of goons sitting inside.  
               Basically, it looks like normal morning activity in front of 
               Butch's home.

               Butch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information.

               Butch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything. He 
               crosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard.

               Across the street from Butch's building, on the corner, is a 
               combination donut shop and Japanese restaurant. A big sign 
               sticks up in the air, with the name "Teriyaki Donut" and a 
               graphic of a donut sticking out of a bowl of rice.

               EXT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT COURTYARD  DAY

               Butch is in the courtyard of his North Hollywood apartment 
               building. Once again, everything appears normal  the laundry 
               room, the pool, his apartment door  nothing appears 
               disturbed.

               Butch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment, number 12. 
               He steps outside the door and listens inside. Nothing.

               Butch slowly inserts the key into the door, quietly opening 
               it.

               INT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT  DAY

               His apartment hasn't been touched.

               He cautiously steps inside, shuts the door and takes a quick 
               look around. Obviously, no one is there.

               Butch walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the 
               refrigerator.

               He takes out a carton of milk and drinks from it.

               With carton in hard, Butch surveys the apartment. Then he 
               goes to the bedroom.

               His bedroom is like the rest of the apartment  neat, clean 
               and anonymous. The only things personal in his room are a 
               few boxing trophies, an Olympic silver medal, a framed issue 
               of "Ring Magazine" with Butch on the cover, and a poster of 
               Jerry Quarry and one of George Chuvalo.

               Sure enough, there's the watch just like he said it was: On 
               the bedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue.

               He walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen. He 
               opens a cupboard and takes out a box of Pop Tarts. Putting 
               down the milk, he opens the box, takes out two Pop Tarts and 
               puts them in the toaster.

               Butch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something.

               What he sees is a small compact Czech M61 submachine gun 
               with a huge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter.

                                     BUTCH
                              (softly)
                         Holy shit.

               He picks up the intimidating peace of weaponry and examines 
               it.

               Then... a toilet FLUSHES.

               Butch looks up to the bathroom door, which is parallel to 
               the kitchen. There is someone behind it.

               Like a rabbit caught in a radish patch, Butch freezes, not 
               knowing what to do.

               The bathroom door opens and Vincent Vega steps out of the 
               bathroom, tightening his belt. In his hand is the book 
               "MODESTY BLAISE" by Peter O'Donnell.

               Vincent and Butch lock eyes.

               Vincent freezes.

               Butch doesn't move, except to point the M61 in Vincent's 
               direction.

               Neither man opens his mouth.

               Then... the toaster LOUDLY kicks up the Pop Tarts.

               That's all the situation needed.

               Butch's finger HITS the trigger.

               MUFFLED FIRE SHOOTS out of the end of the gun.

               Vincent is seemingly WRACKED with twenty bullets 
               SIMULTANEOUSLY  LIFTING him off his feet, PROPELLING him 
               through the air and CRASHING through the glass shower door 
               at the end of the bathroom.

               By the time Butch removes his finger from the trigger, Vincent 
               is annihilated.

               Butch stands frozen, amazed at what just happened. His look 
               goes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once 
               Vincent, down to the powerful piece of artillery in his grip.

               With the respect it deserves, Butch carefully places the M61 
               back on the kitchen counter.

               Then he exits the apartment, quickly.

               EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD  DAY

               Butch, not running, but walking very rapidly, crosses the 
               courtyard...

               ...comes out of the apartment building, crosses the street...

               ...goes through the alley...

               ...and into his car in one STEADICAM SHOT.

               EXT. HONDA  DAY

               Butch CRANKS the car into gear and drives away. The big wide 
               smile of a survivor breaks across his face.

               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING STREET  DAY

               The Honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his 
               apartment building.

               INT. HONDA  DAY

               Butch looks out the window at his former home.

                                     BUTCH
                         That's how you're gonna beat 'em, 
                         Butch.  They keep underestimatin' 
                         ya.

               This makes the boxer laugh out loud. As he laughs, he flips 
               a tape in the cassette player. When the MUSIC starts, he 
               SINGS along with it.

               He drives by the apartment, but is stopped at the light on 
               the corner across from Teriyaki Donut.

               Butch is still chuckling, singing along with the song, as we 
               see:

               THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

               The big man himself, Marsellus Wallace, exit Teriyaki Donut, 
               carrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam 
               cups of coffee. He steps off the curb, crossing the street 
               in front of Butch's car. This is the first time we see 
               Marsellus clearly.

               Laughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front 
               of him.

               When Marsellus is in front of Butch's car, he casually glances 
               to his left, sees Butch, continues walking... then STOPS!

               DOUBLE-TAKE: "Am I really seeing what I'm seeing?"

               Butch doesn't wait for the big man to answer his own question. 
               He STOMPS on the gas pedal.

               The little Honda SLAMS into Marsellus, sending him, the donuts 
               and the coffee HITTING the pavement at thirty miles an hour.

               Butch CUTS into cross traffic and is BROAD-SIDED by a gold 
               Camaro Z-28, BREAKING all the windows in the Honda and sending 
               it up on the sidewalk.

               Butch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what 
               at one time was Fabienne's Honda. Blood flows from his 
               nostrils. The still-functional tape player continues to play. 
               A PEDESTRIAN pokes his head inside.

                                     PEDESTRIAN
                         Jesus, are you okay?

               Butch look at him, spaced-out.

                                     BUTCH
                         I guess.

               Marsellus Wallace lies sprawled out in the street. GAWKERS 
               gather around the body.

                                     GAWKER #1
                              (to the others)
                         He's dead! He's dead!

               This jerk's yelling makes Marsellus come to.

               TWO PEDESTRIANS help the shaken Butch out of the wreckage.

               The woozy Marsellus gets to his feet.

                                     GAWKER #2
                         If you need a witness in court, I'll 
                         be glad to help. He was a drunken 
                         maniac. He hit you and crashed into 
                         that car.

                                     MARSELLUS
                              (still incoherent)
                         Who?

                                     GAWKER #2
                              (pointing at Butch)
                         Him.

               Marsellus follows the Gawker's finger and sees Butch Coolidge 
               down the street, looking a shambles.

                                     MARSELLUS
                         Well, I'll be damned.

               The big man takes out a .45 Automatic and the Gawkers back 
               away.

               Marsellus starts moving toward Butch.

               Butch sees the fierce figure making a wobbly bee-line toward 
               him.

                                     BUTCH
                         Sacre bleu.

               Marsellus brings up his weapon and FIRES, but he's so hurt, 
               shaky and dazed that his arm goes wild.

               He HITS a LOOKY-LOO WOMAN in the hip. She falls to the ground, 
               screaming.

                                     LOOKY-LOO WOMAN
                         Oh my God, I've been shot!

               That's all Butch needs to see. He's outta here.

               Marsellus RUNS after him.

               The CROWD looks agape.

               Butch is in a mad, limping RUN.

               The big man's hot on his ass with a cockeyed wobbly run.

               Butch cuts across traffic and dashes into a business with a 
               sign that reads "MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP".

               INT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP  DAY

               MAYNARD, a hillbilly-lookin' boy, stands behind the counter 
               of his pawnshop when, all of a sudden, chaos in the form of 
               Butch RACES into his world.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Can I help you wit' somethin'?

                                     BUTCH
                         Shut up!

               Butch quickly takes measure of the situation, than stands 
               next to the door.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Now you just wait one goddamn minute 
                         

               Before Maynard can finish his threat, Marsellus CHARGES in. 
               He doesn't get past the doorway because Butch LANDS his fist 
               in Marsellus' face.

               The gangster's feet go out from under him and the big man 
               FALLS FLAT on his back.

               Outside, two police cars with their SIRENS BLARING race by.

               Butch POUNCES on the fallen body, PUNCHING him twice more in 
               the face.

               Butch takes the gun out of Marsellus' hand, than grabs ahold 
               of his middle finger.

                                     BUTCH
                         So you like chasing people, huh?

               He BREAKS the finger. Marsellus lets out a pain sound.  Butch 
               then places the barrel of the .45 between his eyes, PULLS 
               back the hammer and places his open hand behind the gun to 
               shield the splatter.

                                     BUTCH
                         Well guess what, big man, you caught 
                         me 

                                     MAYNARD (O.S.)
                          hold it right there, godammit!

               Butch and Marsellus look up at Maynard, who's brandishing a 
               pumpaction shotgun, aimed at the two men.

                                     BUTCH
                         Look mister, this ain't any of your 
                         business 

                                     MAYNARD
                          I'm makin' it my business! Now 
                         toss that gun!

               Butch does.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Now you on top, stand up and come to 
                         the counter.

               Butch slowly gets up and moves to the counter. As soon as he 
               gets there, Maynard HAULS OFF, HITTING him hard in the face 
               with the butt of the shotgun, knocking Butch down and out.

               After Butch goes down, Maynard calmly lays the shotgun on 
               the counter and moves to the telephone.

               Marsellus Wallace, from his position on the floor, groggily 
               watches the pawnshop owner dial a number. Maynard waits on 
               the line while the other end rings. Then it picks up.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Zed? It's Maynard. The spider just 
                         caught a coupl'a flies.

               Marsellus passes out.

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

               FADE UP:

               INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM  DAY

               TWO SHOT  BUTCH AND MARSELLUS

               They are tied up in two separate chairs. In their mouths are 
               two S&M-style ball gags (a belt goes around their heads and 
               a little red ball sticks in their mouths). Both men are 
               unconscious.

               Maynard steps in with a fire extinguisher and SPRAYS both 
               guys until they're wide awake and wet as otters. The two 
               prisoners look up at their captors.

               Maynard stands in front of them, fire extinguisher in one 
               hand, shotgun in the other, and Marsellus' .45 sticking in 
               his belt.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Nobody kills anybody in my place of 
                         business except me or Zed.

               A BUZZER buzzes.

                                     MAYNARD
                         That's Zed.

               Without saying another word, Maynard climbs up the stairs 
               that lead to red curtains and goes through them.

               WE HEAR, on the other side of the curtains, Maynard let Zed 
               inside the store.

               Butch and Marsellus look around the room. The basement of 
               the pawnshop has been converted into a dungeon. After taking 
               in their predicament, Butch and Marsellus look at each other, 
               all traces of hostility gone, replaced by a terror they both 
               share at what they've gotten themselves into.

               Maynard and ZED come through the curtains. Zed is an even 
               more intense version of Maynard, if such a thing is possible. 
               The two hillbillys are obviously brothers. Where Maynard is 
               a vicious pitbull, Zed is a deadly cobra. Zed walks in and 
               stands in front of the two captives. He inspects them for a 
               long time, then says:

                                     ZED
                              (to Maynard)
                         You said you waited for me?

                                     MAYNARD
                         I did.

                                     ZED
                         Then how come they're all beat up?

                                     MAYNARD
                         They did that to each other. They 
                         was fightin' when they came in. This 
                         one was gonna shoot that one.

                                     ZED
                              (to Butch)
                         You were gonna shoot him?

               Butch makes no reply.

                                     ZED
                         Hey, is Grace gonna be okay in front 
                         of this place?

                                     MAYNARD
                         Yeah, it ain't Tuesday is it?

                                     ZED
                         No, it's Thursday.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Then she'll be fine.

                                     ZED
                         Bring out The Gimp.

                                     MAYNARD
                         I think The Gimp's sleepin'.

                                     ZED
                         Well, I guess you'll just wake 'em 
                         up then, won't you?

               Maynard opens a trap door in the floor.

                                     MAYNARD
                              (yelling in the hole)
                         Wake up!

               Maynard reaches into the hole and comes back holding onto a 
               leash.

               He gives it a rough yank and, from below the floor, rises 
               THE GIMP.

               The Gimp is a man they keep dressed from head to toe in black 
               leather bondage gear. There are zippers, buckles and studs 
               here and there on the body. On his head is a black leather 
               mask with two eye holes and a zipper (closed) for a mouth. 
               They keep him in a hole in the floor big enough for a large 
               dog.

               Zed takes the chair, sits it in front of the two prisoners, 
               then lowers into it. Maynard hands The Gimp's leash to Zed, 
               then backs away.

                                     MAYNARD
                              (to The Gimp)
                         Down!

               The Gimp gets on its knees.

               Maynard hangs back while Zed appraises the two men.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Who's first?

                                     ZED
                         I ain't fer sure yet.

               Then with his little finger, Zed does a silent "Eenie, meany, 
               miney, moe... " just his mouth mouthing the words and his 
               finger going back and forth between the two.

               Butch are Marsellus are terrified.

               Maynard looks back and forth at the victims.

               The Gimps's eyes go from one to the other inside the mask.

               Zed continues his silent sing-song with his finger moving 
               left to right, then it stops.

               TWO SHOT  BUTCH AND MARSELLUS

               After a beat, THE CAMERA MOVES to the right, zeroing in on 
               Marsellus.

               Zed stands up.

                                     ZED
                         Wanna do it here?

                                     MAYNARD
                         Naw, drag big boy to Russell's old 
                         room.

               Zed grabs Marsellus' chair and DRAGS him into Russell's old 
               room.

               Russell, no doubt, was some other poor bastard that has the 
               misfortune of stumbling into the Mason-Dixie pawnshop. 
               Whatever happened to Russell is known only to Maynard and 
               Zed because his old room, a back room in the back of the 
               back room, is empty.

               As Marsellus is dragged away, he locks eyes with Butch before 
               he disappears behind the door of Russell's old room.

                                     MAYNARD
                              (to The Gimp)
                         Up!

               The Gimp rises. Maynard ties The Gimp's leash to a hook on 
               the ceiling.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Keep an eye on this one.

               The Gimp bows its head: "yes." Maynard disappears into 
               Russell's old room. There must be a stereo in there because 
               suddenly The Judds, singing in harmony, fills the air.

               Butch looks at The Gimp. The Gimp giggles from underneath 
               the mask as if this were the funniest moment in the history 
               of comedy.

               From behind the door we hear country MUSIC, struggling, and:

                                     MAYNARD (O.S.)
                         Whoa, this boy's got a bit of fight 
                         in 'em!

               We the HEAR Maynard and Zed beat on Marsellus.

                                     ZED (O.S.)
                         You wanna fight? You wanna fight? 
                         Good, I like to fight!

               Butch pauses, listens to the voices. Then, in a panic, 
               hurriedly struggles to get free.

               The Gimp is laughing wildly.

               The ropes are on too tight and Butch can't break free.

               The Gimp slaps his knee laughing In the back room, we hear:

                                     MAYNARD (O.S.)
                         That's it... that's it boy, you're 
                         goin' fine. Oooooooh, just like 
                         that... that's good.
                              (grunting faster)
                         Stay still... stay still goddamn ya! 
                         Zed goddammit, git over here and 
                         hold 'em!

               Butch stops struggling and lifts up on his arms. Then, quite 
               easily, the padded chair back slides up and off as if it 
               were never connected by a bolt.

               The Gimp sees this and its eyes widen.

                                     THE GIMP
                         Huhng?

               The Gimp FLAILS WILDLY, trying to get the leash off the hook. 
               He tries to yell, but all that comes out are excited gurgles 
               and grunts.

               Butch is out of his chair, quickly dispensing three BOXER'S 
               PUNCHES to its face. The punches knock The Gimp out, making 
               him fall to his knees, this HANGING HIMSELF by the leash 
               attached to the hook, Butch removes the ball gag, then 
               silently makes his way through the red curtains.

               INT. PAWNSHOP  DAY

               Butch sneaks to the door.

               On the counter is a big set of keys with a large Z connected 
               to the ring. Grabbing them, he's about to go out when he 
               stops and listens to the hillbilly psychopaths having their 
               way with Marsellus.

               Butch decides for the life of him, he can't leave anybody in 
               a situation like that. Se he begins rooting around the 
               pawnshop for a weapon to bash those hillbillies' heads in 
               with.

               He picks up a big destructive-looking hammer, then discards 
               it: Not destructive enough. He picks up a chainsaw, thinks 
               about it for a moment, then puts it back. Next, a large 
               Louisville slugger he tries on for size. But then he spots 
               what he's been looking for:

               A Samurai sword.

               It hands in its hand-carved wood sheath from a nail on the 
               wall, next to a neon "DAD'S OLD-FASHIONED ROOT BEER" sign. 
               Butch takes the sword off the wall, removing it from its 
               sheath. It's a magnificent piece of steel. It seems to glisten 
               in the low-wattage light of the pawnshop. Butch touches his 
               thumb to the blade to see if the sword is just for show. Not 
               on your life. It's as sharp as it gets. This weapon seems 
               made to order for the Brothers Grimm downstairs. Holding the 
               sword pointed downward, Takakura Kenstyle, he disappears 
               through the red curtains to take care of business.

               INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM  DAY

               Butch quietly sneaks down the stairs leading to the dungeon.

               Sodomy and the Judds can still be heard going string behind 
               the closed door that leads to Russell's old room.

               INT. RUSSELL'S OLD ROOM  DAY

               Butch's hand comes into frame, pushing the door open. It 
               swings open silently, revealing the rapists, who have switched 
               positions.

               Zed is now bent over Marsellus, who is bent over a wooden 
               horse.

               Maynard watches. Both have their backs to Butch.

               Maynard faces the CAMERA, grinning, while Butch comes up 
               behind him with the sword.

               Miserable, violated, and looking like a rag doll, Marsellus, 
               red ball gag still in mouth, opens his watery eyes to see 
               Butch coming up behind Maynard. His eyes widen.

                                     BUTCH
                         Hey hillbilly.

               Maynard turns and sees Butch holding the sword.

               Butch SCREAMS... with one mighty SWING, SLASHES Maynard across 
               the front, moving past him, eyes and blade now locked on 
               Zed.

               Maynard stands trembling, his front sliced open, in shock.

               Butch, while never taking his eyes off Zed, THRUSTS the sword 
               behind him, SKEWERING Maynard, then EXTRACTS it, pointing 
               the blade toward Zed. Maynard COLLAPSES.

               Zed disengages from Marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go 
               from the tip of Butch's sword to Marsellus' .45 Automatic, 
               which lies within reach.

               Butch's eyes follow Zed's.

                                     BUTCH
                         You want that gun, Zed? Pick it up.

               Zed's hand inches toward the weapon.

               Butch GRIPS the sword tighter.

               Zed studies Butch.

               Butch looks hard at Zed.

               Then a VOICE says:

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)
                         Step aside, Butch.

               Butch steps aside, REVEALING Marsellus standing behind him, 
               holding Maynard's pump-action shotgun.

               KABOOM!!!!

               Zed is BLASTED in the groin. Down he goes, SCREAMING in AGONY.

               Marsellus, looking down at his whimpering rapist, EJECTS the 
               used shotgun shell.

               Butch lowers the sword and hangs back. Not a word, until:

                                     BUTCH
                         You okay?

                                     MARSELLUS
                         Naw man. I'm pretty fuckin' far from 
                         okay!

               Long pause.

                                     BUTCH
                         What now?

                                     MARSELLUS
                         What now? Well let me tell you what 
                         now.  I'm gonna call a couple pipe-
                         hittin' niggers, who'll go to work 
                         on homes here with a pair of pliers 
                         and a blow torch.
                              (to Zed)
                         Hear me talkin' hillbilly boy?! I 
                         ain't through with you by a damn 
                         sight. I'm gonna git Medieval on 
                         your ass.

                                     BUTCH
                         I meant what now, between me and 
                         you?

                                     MARSELLUS
                         Oh, that what now? Well, let me tell 
                         ya what now between me an' you. There 
                         is no me an' you. Not no more.

                                     BUTCH
                         So we're cool?

                                     MARSELLUS
                         Yeah man, we're cool. One thing I 
                         ask  two things I ask: Don't tell 
                         nobody about this. This shit's between 
                         me and you and the soon-to-be-livin'-
                         the-rest-of-his-short-ass-life-in-
                         agonizing-pain, Mr. Rapist here. It 
                         ain't nobody else's business. Two: 
                         leave town. Tonight. Right now. And 
                         when you're gone, stay gone.  You've 
                         lost your Los Angeles privileges.  
                         Deal?

                                     BUTCH
                         Deal.

               The two men shake hands, then hug one another.

                                     MARSELLUS
                         Go on now, get your ass outta here.

               Butch leaves Russell's old room through the red curtains.

               Marsellus walks over to a phone, dialing a number.

                                     MARSELLUS
                              (into the phone)
                         Hello Mr. Wolf, it's Marsellus. Gotta 
                         bit of a situation.

               EXT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP  DAY

               Butch, still shaking in his boots, exits the pawnshop. He 
               looks ahead and sees, parked in front of the establishment, 
               Zed's Big Chrome Chopper with a teardrop gas tank that has 
               the name "GRACE" on it. He climbs aboard, takes out the keys 
               with the big Z on them and starts up the huge hog. It RUMBLES 
               to life, making sounds like a rocket fighting for orbit. 
               Butch twists the accelerator handle and SPEEDS off.

               WE CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN...

               INT. BUTCH AND FABIENNE'S HOTEL ROOM  DAY

               Fabienne stands in front of a mirror wearing a "Frankie says, 
               Relax" tee-shirt, singing along with MUSIC coming from a 
               BOOM BOX.

               EXT. CITY STREET  CHOPPER (MOVING)  DAY

               Butch drives down the street, humping a hot hog named "GRACE." 
               He checks his father's watch. It says: 10:30.

               The SONG in the motel room PLAYS OVER this.

               EXT. MOTEL ROOM  DAY

               Butch rides up on Grace. He hops off and runs inside the 
               motel room, while we stay outside with the bike.

                                     FABIENNE (O.S.)
                         Butch, I was so worried!

                                     BUTCH
                         Honey, grab your radio and your purse 
                         and let's go!

                                     FABIENNE (O.S.)
                         But what about all our bags?

                                     BUTCH
                         Fuck the bags. We'll miss our train 
                         if we don't split now.

                                     FABIENNE (O.S.)
                         Is everything well? Are we in danger?

                                     BUTCH
                         We're cool. In fact, we're super-
                         cool. But we gots to go. I'll wait 
                         for you outside.

               Butch runs out and hops back on the bike. Fabienne exits the 
               motel room with the boom box and a large purse. When she 
               sees Butch on the chopper, she stops dead.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Where did you get this motorcycle?

                                     BUTCH
                              (he kick-starts it)
                         It's a chopper, baby, hop on.

               Fabienne slowly approaches the two-wheel demon.

                                     FABIENNE
                         What happened to my Honda?

                                     BUTCH
                         Sorry baby, I crashed the Honda.

                                     FABIENNE
                         You're hurt?

                                     BUTCH
                         I might've broke my nose, no biggie. 
                         Hop on.

               She doesn't move.

               Butch looks at her.

                                     BUTCH
                         Honey, we gotta hit the fuckin' road!

               Fabienne starts to cry.

               Butch realizes that this is not the way to get her on the 
               bike. He turns off the engine and reaches out, taking her 
               hand.

                                     BUTCH
                         I'm sorry, baby-love.

                                     FABIENNE
                              (crying)
                         You were gone so long, I started to 
                         think dreadful thoughts.

                                     BUTCH
                         I'm sorry I worried you, sweetie.
                         Everything's fine. Hey, how was 
                         breakfast?

                                     FABIENNE
                              (waterworks drying a 
                              little)
                         It was good 

                                     BUTCH
                          did you get the blueberry pancakes?

                                     FABIENNE
                         No, they didn't have blueberry 
                         pancakes, I had to get buttermilk  
                         are you sure you're okay?

                                     BUTCH
                         Baby-love, from the moment I left 
                         you, this has been without a doubt 
                         the single weirdest day of my entire 
                         life. Climb on an' I'll tell ya about 
                         it.

               Fabienne does climb on. Butch STARTS her up.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Butch, whose motorcycle is this?

                                     BUTCH
                         It's a chopper.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Whose chopper is this?

                                     BUTCH
                         Zed's.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Who's Zed?

                                     BUTCH
                         Zed's dead, baby, Zed's dead.

               And with that, the two lovebirds PEEL AWAY on Grace, as the 
               SONG on the BOOM BOX RISES.

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

               TITLE CARD:

                            "JULES VINCENT JIMMIE & THE WOLF"

               TITLE DISAPPEARS.

               Over black, we can HEAR in the distance, men talking.

                                     JULES (O.S.)
                         You ever read the Bible, Brett?

                                     BRETT (O.S.)
                         Yes!

                                     JULES (O.S.)
                         There's a passage I got memorized, 
                         seems appropriate for this situation: 
                         Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the 
                         righteous man is beset on all sides 
                         by the inequities of the selfish and 
                         the tyranny of evil men..."

               FADE UP:

               INT. BATHROOM  DAY

               We're in the bathroom of the Hollywood apartment we were in 
               earlier. In fact, we're there at exactly the same time. Except 
               this time, we're in the bathroom with the FOURTH MAN. The 
               Fourth Man is pacing around the small room, listening hard 
               to what's being said on the other side of the door, tightly 
               CLUTCHING his huge silver .357 Magnum.

                                     JULES (O.S.)
                         "...blessed is he who, in the name 
                         of charity and good will, shepherded 
                         the weak through the valley of 
                         darkness. And I will strike down 
                         upon thee with great vengeance and 
                         furious anger those who attempt to 
                         poison and destroy my brothers. And 
                         you will know I am the Lord when I 
                         lay my vengeance upon you."

               BANG! BANG! BOOM! POW! BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM!

               The Fourth Man freaks out. He THROWS himself against the 
               back wall, gun outstretched in front of him, a look of yellow 
               fear on his face, ready to blow in half anybody fool enough 
               to stick their head through that door.

               Then he listens to them talk.

                                     VINCENT (O.S.)
                         Friend of yours?

                                     JULES (O.S.)
                         Yeah, Marvin-Vincent-Vincent-Marvin.

               Waiting for them isn't the smartest move. Bursting out the 
               door and blowing them all away while they're fuckin' around 
               is the way to go.

               INT. APARTMENT  DAY

               The bathroom door BURSTS OPEN and the Fourth Man CHARGES 
               out, silver Magnum raised, FIRING SIX BOOMING SHOTS from his 
               hand cannon.

                                     FOURTH MAN
                         Die... die... die... die...!

               DOLLY INTO Fourth Man, same as before.

               He SCREAM until he's dry firing. Then a look of confusion 
               crosses his face.

               TWO SHOT  JULES AND VINCENT

               Standing next to each other, unharmed. Amazing as it seems, 
               none of the Fourth Man's shots appear to have hit anybody. 
               Jules and Vincent exchange looks like, "Are we hit?" They're 
               as confused at the shooter. After looking at each other, 
               they bring their looks up to the Fourth Man.

                                     FOURTH MAN
                         I don't understand 

               The Fourth Man is taken out of the scenario by the two men's 
               bullets who, unlike his, HIT their marks. He drops DEAD.

               The two men lower their guns. Jules, obviously shaken, sits 
               down in a chair. Vincent, after a moment of respect, shrugs 
               it off.

               Then heads toward Marvin in the corner.

                                     VINCENT
                         Why the fuck didn't you tell us about 
                         that guy in the bathroom? Slip your 
                         mind?  Forget he was in there with a 
                         goddamn hand cannon?

                                     JULES
                              (to himself)
                         We should be fuckin' dead right now.
                              (pause)
                         Did you see that gun he fired at us? 
                         It was bigger than him.

                                     VINCENT
                         .357.

                                     JULES
                         We should be fuckin' dead!

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah, we were lucky.

               Jules rises, moving toward Vincent.

                                     JULES
                         That shit wasn't luck. That shit was 
                         somethin' else.

               Vincent prepares to leave.

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah, maybe.

                                     JULES
                         That was... divine intervention. You 
                         know what divine intervention is?

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah, I think so. That means God 
                         came down from Heaven and stopped 
                         the bullets.

                                     JULES
                         Yeah, man, that's what is means. 
                         That's exactly what it means! God 
                         came down from Heaven and stopped 
                         the bullets.

                                     VINCENT
                         I think we should be going now.

                                     JULES
                         Don't do that! Don't you fuckin' do 
                         that!  Don't blow this shit off! 
                         What just happened was a fuckin' 
                         miracle!

                                     VINCENT
                         Chill the fuck out, Jules, this shit 
                         happens.

                                     JULES
                         Wrong, wrong, this shit doesn't just 
                         happen.

                                     VINCENT
                         Do you wanna continue this theological 
                         discussion in the car, or at the 
                         jailhouse with the cops?

                                     JULES
                         We should be fuckin' dead now, my 
                         friend!  We just witnessed a miracle, 
                         and I want you to fuckin' acknowledge 
                         it!

                                     VINCENT
                         Okay man, it was a miracle, can we 
                         leave now?

               EXT. HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT BUILDING  MORNING

               The Chevy Nova PROPELS itself into traffic.

               INT. NOVA (MOVING)  MORNING

               Jules is behind the wheel,Vincent in the passenger seat and 
               Marvin in the back.

                                     VINCENT
                         ...Ever seen that show "COPS?"  I 
                         was watchin' it once and this cop 
                         was on it who was talkin' about this 
                         time he got into this gun fight with 
                         a guy in a hallway. He unloads on 
                         this guy and he doesn't hit anything. 
                         And these guys were in a hallway. 
                         It's a freak, but it happens.

                                     JULES
                         If you wanna play blind man, then go 
                         walk with a Shepherd. But me, my 
                         eyes are wide fuckin' open.

                                     VINCENT
                         What the fuck does that mean?

                                     JULES
                         That's it for me. For here on in, 
                         you can consider my ass retired.

                                     VINCENT
                         Jesus Christ!

                                     JULES
                         Don't blaspheme!

                                     VINCENT
                         Goddammit, Jules 

                                     JULES
                          I said don't do that 

                                     VINCENT
                          you're fuckin' freakin' out!

                                     JULES
                         I'm tellin' Marsellus today I'm 
                         through.

                                     VINCENT
                         While you're at it, be sure to tell 
                         'im why.

                                     JULES
                         Don't worry, I will.

                                     VINCENT
                         I'll bet ya ten thousand dollars, he 
                         laughs his ass off.

                                     JULES
                         I don't give a damn if he does.

               Vincent turns to the backseat with the .45 casually in his 
               grip.

                                     VINCENT
                         Marvin, what do you make of all this?

                                     MARVIN
                         I don't even have an opinion.

                                     VINCENT
                         C'mon, Marvin. Do you think God came 
                         down from Heaven and stopped the 
                         bullets?

               Vincent's .45 goes BANG!

               Marvin is hit in the upper chest, below the throat. He GURGLES 
               blood and SHAKES.

                                     JULES
                         What the fuck's happening?

                                     VINCENT
                         I just accidentally shot Marvin in 
                         the throat.

                                     JULES
                         Why the fuck did you do that?

                                     VINCENT
                         I didn't mean to do it. I said it 
                         was an accident.

                                     JULES
                         I've seen a lot of crazy-ass shit in 
                         my time 

                                     VINCENT
                          chill out, man, it was an accident, 
                         okay? You hit a bump or somethin' 
                         and the gun went off.

                                     JULES
                         The car didn't hit no motherfuckin' 
                         bump!

                                     VINCENT
                         Look! I didn't mean to shoot this 
                         son-ofa-bitch, the gun just went 
                         off, don't ask me how!

                                     JULES
                         Look at this mess! We're drivin' 
                         around on a city street in broad 
                         daylight 

                                     VINCENT
                          I know, I know, I wasn't thinkin' 
                         about the splatter.

                                     JULES
                         Well you better be thinkin' about it 
                         now, motherfucker! We gotta get this 
                         car off the road. Cops tend to notice 
                         shit like you're driving a car 
                         drenched in fuckin' blood.

                                     VINCENT
                         Can't we just take it to a friendly 
                         place?

                                     JULES
                         This is the Valley, Vincent. Marsellus 
                         don't got no friendly places in the 
                         Valley.

                                     VINCENT
                         Well, don't look at me, this is your 
                         town, Jules.

               Jules takes out a cellular phone and starts punching digits.

                                     VINCENT
                         Who ya callin'?

                                     JULES
                         A buddy of mine in Toluca Lake.

                                     VINCENT
                         Where's Toluca Lake.

                                     JULES
                         On the other side of the hill, by 
                         Burbank Studios. If Jimmie's ass 
                         ain't home, I don't know what the 
                         fuck we're gonna go. I ain't got any 
                         other partners in 818.
                              (into phone)
                         Jimmie! How you doin' man, it's Jules.
                              (pause)
                         Listen up man, me an' my homeboy are 
                         in some serious shit. We're in a car 
                         we gotta get off the road, pronto! I 
                         need to use your garage for a couple 
                         hours.

               INT. JIMMIE'S BATHROOM  DAY

               Jules is bent over a sink, washing his bloody hands while 
               Vincent stands behind him.

                                     JULES
                         We gotta be real fuckin' delicate 
                         with this Jimmie's situation. He's 
                         one remark away from kickin' our 
                         asses out the door.

                                     VINCENT
                         If he kicks us out, whadda we do?

                                     JULES
                         Well, we ain't leavin' 'til we made 
                         a couple phone calls. But I never 
                         want it to reach that pitch. Jimmie's 
                         my friend and you don't bust in your 
                         friend's house and start tellin' 'im 
                         what's what.

               Jules rises and dries his hands. Vincent takes his place at 
               the sink.

                                     VINCENT
                         Just tell 'im not to be abusive. He 
                         kinda freaked out back there when he 
                         saw Marvin.

                                     JULES
                         Put yourself in his position. It's 
                         eight o'clock in the morning. He 
                         just woke up, he wasn't prepared for 
                         this shit. Don't forget who's doin' 
                         who a favor.

               Vincent finishes, then dries his hands on a white towel.

                                     VINCENT
                         If the price of that favor is I gotta 
                         take shit, he can stick his favor 
                         straight up his ass.

               When Vincent is finished drying his hands, the towel is 
               stained with red.

                                     JULES
                         What the fuck did you just do to his 
                         towel?

                                     VINCENT
                         I was just dryin' my hands.

                                     JULES
                         You're supposed to wash 'em first.

                                     VINCENT
                         You watched me wash 'em.

                                     JULES
                         I watched you get 'em wet.

                                     VINCENT
                         I washed 'em. Blood's real hard to 
                         get off. Maybe if he had some Lava, 
                         I coulda done a better job.

                                     JULES
                         I used the same soap you did and 
                         when I dried my hands, the towel 
                         didn't look like a fuckin' Maxie 
                         pad. Look, fuck it, alright. Who 
                         cares? But it's shit like this that's 
                         gonna bring this situation to a boil. 
                         If he were to come in here and see 
                         that towel like that... I'm tellin' 
                         you Vincent, you best be cool. 'Cause 
                         if I gotta get in to it with Jimmie 
                         on account of you... Look, I ain't 
                         threatenin' you, I respect you an' 
                         all, just don't put me in that 
                         position.

                                     JULES
                         Jules, you ask me nice like that, no 
                         problem. He's your friend, you handle 
                         him.

               INT. JIMMIE'S KITCHEN  MORNING

               Three men are standing in Jimmie's kitchen, each with a mug 
               of coffee. Jules, Vincent and JIMMIE DIMMICK, a young man in 
               his late 20s dressed in a bathrobe.

                                     JULES
                         Goddamn Jimmie, this is some serious 
                         gourmet shit. Me an' Vincent woulda 
                         been satisfied with freeze-dried 
                         Tasters Choice. You spring this 
                         gourmet fuckin' shit on us. What 
                         flavor is this?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Knock it off, Julie.

                                     JULES
                         What?

                                     JIMMIE
                         I'm not a cobb or corn, so you can 
                         stop butterin' me up. I don't need 
                         you to tell me how good my coffee 
                         is. I'm the one who buys it, I know 
                         how fuckin' good it is.  When Bonnie 
                         goes shoppin;, she buys shit.  I buy 
                         the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause 
                         when I drink it, I wanna taste it. 
                         But what's on my mind at this moment 
                         isn't the coffee in my kitchen, it's 
                         the dead nigger in my garage.

                         Jimmie 

                                     JIMMIE
                          I'm talkin'. Now let me ask you a 
                         question, Jules. When you drove in 
                         here, did you notice a sign out front 
                         that said, "Dead nigger storage?"

               Jules starts to "Jimmie" him 

                                     JIMMIE
                          answer to question. Did you see a 
                         sign out in front of my house that 
                         said, "Dead nigger storage?"

                                     JULES
                              (playing along)
                         Naw man, I didn't.

                                     JIMMIE
                         You know why you didn't see that 
                         sign?

                                     JULES
                         Why?

                                     JIMMIE
                         'Cause storin' dead niggers ain't my 
                         fuckin' business!

               Jules starts to "Jimmie" him.

                                     JIMMIE
                          I ain't through! Now don't you 
                         understand that if Bonnie comes home 
                         and finds a dead body in her house, 
                         I'm gonna get divorced. No marriage 
                         counselor, no trial separation  
                         fuckin' divorced. And I don't wanna 
                         get fuckin' divorced. The last time 
                         me an' Bonnie talked about this shit 
                         was gonna be the last time me an' 
                         Bonnie talked about this shit. Now I 
                         wanna help ya out Julie, I really 
                         do. But I ain't gonna lose my wife 
                         doin' it.

                                     JULES
                         Jimmie 

                                     JIMMIE
                          don't fuckin' Jimmie me, man, I 
                         can't be Jimmied. There's nothin' 
                         you can say that's gonna make me 
                         forget I love my wife. Now she's 
                         workin' the graveyard shift at the 
                         hospital. She'll be comin' home in 
                         less than an hour and a half. Make 
                         your phone calls, talk to your people, 
                         than get the fuck out of my house.

                                     JULES
                         That's all we want. We don't wanna 
                         fuck up your shit. We just need to 
                         call our people to bring us in.

                                     JIMMIE
                         Then I suggest you get to it. Phone's 
                         in my bedroom.

               INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S DINING ROOM  MORNING

               Marsellus Wallace sits at his dining table in a big comfy 
               robe, eating his large breakfast, while talking on the phone.

                                     MARSELLUS
                         ...well, say she comes home. Whaddya 
                         think she'll do?
                              (pause)
                         No fuckin' shit she'll freak. That 
                         ain't no kinda answer. You know 'er, 
                         I don't.  How bad, a lot or a little?

               INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM  MORNING

               Jules paces around in Jimmie's bedroom on the phone.

                                     JULES
                         You got to appreciate what an 
                         explosive element this Bonnie 
                         situation is. If she comes home from 
                         a hard day's work and finds a bunch 
                         of gangsters doin' a bunch of gangsta' 
                         shit in her kitchen, ain't no tellin' 
                         what she's apt to do.

                                     MARSELLUS
                         I've grasped that, Jules. All I'm 
                         doin' is contemplating the "ifs."

                                     JULES
                         I don't wanna hear about no 
                         motherfuckin' "ifs."What I wanna 
                         hear from your ass is: "you ain't 
                         got no problems, Jules. I'm on the 
                         motherfucker. Go back in there, chill 
                         them niggers out and wait for the 
                         cavalry, which should be comin' 
                         directly."

                                     MARSELLUS
                         You ain't got no problems, Jules. 
                         I'm on the motherfucker. Go back in 
                         there, chill them niggers out and 
                         wait for The Wolf, who should be 
                         comin' directly.

                                     JULES
                         You sendin' The Wolf?

                                     MARSELLUS
                         Feel better?

                                     JULES
                         Shit Negro, that's all you had to 
                         say.

               INT. HOTEL SUITE  MORNING

               The CAMERA looks through the bedroom doorway of a hotel suite 
               into the main area. We SEE a crap game being played on a 
               fancy crap table by GAMBLERS in tuxedos and LUCKY LADIES in 
               fancy evening gowns. The CAMERA PANS to the right revealing: 
               Sitting on a bed, phone in hand with his back to us, the 
               tuxedo-clad WINSTON WOLF aka "THE WOLF". We also see The 
               Wolf has a small notepad that he jots details in.

                                     THE WOLF
                              (into phone)
                         Is she the hysterical type?
                              (pause)
                         When she due?
                              (jotting down)
                         Give me the principals' names again?
                              (jots down)
                         Jules...

               We SEE his book. The page has written on it:

                            "1265 Riverside Drive Toluca Lake 1 body (no head) 
                            Bloody shot-up car Jules (black)"

                                     THE WOLF
                         ...Vincent... Jimmie... Bonnie...

               HE WRITES:

                   "Vincent (Dean Martin) Jimmie (house) Bonnie (9:30)"

                                     THE WOLF
                         Expect a call around 10:30. It's 
                         about thirty minutes away. I'll be 
                         there in ten.

               He hangs up. We never see his face.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               TITLE CARD OVER BLACK:

                      "NINE MINUTES AND THIRTY-SEVEN SECONDS LATER"

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. JIMMIE'S STREET  MORNING

               A silver Porsche WHIPS the corner leading to Jimmie's home, 
               in HYPER DRIVE. Easily doing 135 mph, the Porsche stops on a 
               dime in front of Jimmie's house.

               A ringed finger touches the doorbell: DING DONG.

               INT. JIMMIE'S HOUSE  MORNING

               Jimmie opens the door. We see, standing in the doorway, the 
               tuxedo-clad man. He looks down to his notebook, then up at 
               Jimmie.

                                     THE WOLF
                         You're Jimmie, right? This is your 
                         house?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Yeah.

                                     THE WOLF
                              (stick his hand out)
                         I'm Winston Wolf, I solve problems.

                                     JIMMIE
                         Good, 'cause we got one.

                                     THE WOLF
                         So I heard. May I come in?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Please do.

               In the dining room, Jules and Vincent stand up.

                                     THE WOLF
                         You must be Jules, which would make 
                         you Vincent. Let's get down to brass 
                         tacks, gentlemen. If I was informed 
                         correctly, the clock is ticking, is 
                         that right, Jimmie?

                                     JIMMIE
                         100%.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Your wife, Bonnie...
                              (refers to his pad)
                         ...comes home at 9:30 in the AM, is 
                         that correct?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Uh-huh.

                                     THE WOLF
                         I was led to believe if she comes 
                         home and finds us here, she wouldn't 
                         appreciate it none too much.

                                     JIMMIE
                         She won't at that.

                                     THE WOLF
                         That gives us forty minutes to get 
                         the fuck outta Dodge, which, if you 
                         do what I say when I say it, should 
                         by plenty. Now you got a corpse in a 
                         car, minus a head, in a garage. Take 
                         me to it.

               INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE  MORNING

               The three men hang back as The Wolf examines the car. He 
               studies the car in silence, opening the door, looking inside, 
               circling it.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Jimmie?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Yes.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I 
                         smelled some coffee in there. Would 
                         you make me a cup?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Sure, how do you take it?

                                     THE WOLF
                         Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.

               Jimmie exists. The Wolf continues his examination.

                                     THE WOLF
                         About the car, is there anything I 
                         need to know? Does it stall, does it 
                         make a lot of noise, does it smoke, 
                         is there gas in it, anything?

                                     JULES
                         Aside from how it looks, the car's 
                         cool.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Positive?  Don't get me out on the 
                         road and I find out the brake lights 
                         don't work.

                                     JULES
                         Hey man, as far as I know, the 
                         motherfucker's tip-top.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Good enough, let's go back to the 
                         kitchen.

               INT. KITCHEN  MORNING

               Jimmie hands The Wolf a cup of coffee.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Thank you, Jimmie.

               He takes a sip, then, pacing as he thinks, lays out for the 
               three men the plan of action.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Okay first thing, you two.
                              (meaning Jules and 
                              Vincent)
                         Take the body, stick it in the trunk. 
                         Now Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty 
                         domesticated house. That would lead 
                         me to believe that in the garage or 
                         under the sink, you got a bunch of 
                         cleansers and cleaners and shit like 
                         that, am I correct?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Yeah. Exactly. Under the sink.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Good. What I need you two fellas to 
                         do is take those cleaning products 
                         and clean the inside of the car. And 
                         I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast. You 
                         need to go in the backseat, scoop up 
                         all those little pieces of brain and 
                         skull. Get it out of there.  Wipe 
                         down the upholstery  now when it 
                         comes to upholstery, it don't need 
                         to be spic and span, you don't need 
                         to eat off it. Give it a good once 
                         over. What you need to take care of 
                         are the really messy parts. The pools 
                         of blood that have collected, you 
                         gotta soak that shit up.  But the 
                         windows are a different story.  Them 
                         you really clean. Get the Windex, do 
                         a good job. Now Jimmie, we need to 
                         raid your linen closet. I need 
                         blankets, I need comforters, I need 
                         quilts, I need bedspreads. The thicker 
                         the better, the darker the better. 
                         No whites, can't use 'em. We need to 
                         camouflage the interior of the car. 
                         We're gonna line the front seat and 
                         the backseat and the floor boards 
                         with quilts and blankets. If a cop 
                         stops us and starts stickin' his big 
                         snout in the car, the subterfuge 
                         won't last. But at a glance, the car 
                         will appear to be normal.  Jimmie  
                         lead the way, boys  get to work.

               The Wolf and Jimmie turn, heading for the bedroom, leaving 
               Vincent and Jules standing in the kitchen.

                                     VINCENT
                              (calling after him)
                         A "please" would be nice.

               The Wolf stops and turns around.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Come again?

                                     VINCENT
                         I said a "please" would be nice.

               The Wolf takes a step toward him.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Set is straight, Buster. I'm not 
                         here to say "please."I'm here to 
                         tell you want to do. And if self-
                         preservation is an instinct you 
                         possess, you better fuckin' do it 
                         and do it quick. I'm here to help.
                         If my help's not appreciated, lotsa 
                         luck gentlemen.

                                     JULES
                         It ain't that way, Mr. Wolf. Your 
                         help is definitely appreciated.

                                     VINCENT
                         I don't mean any disrespect. I just 
                         don't like people barkin' orders at 
                         me.

                                     THE WOLF
                         If I'm curt with you, it's because 
                         time is a factor. I think fast, I 
                         talk fast, and I need you guys to 
                         act fast if you want to get out of 
                         this. So pretty please, with sugar 
                         on top, clean the fuckin' car.

               INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM  MORNING

               Jimmie's gathering all the bedspreads, quilts and linen he 
               has.

               The Wolf is on the phone.

                                     THE WOLF
                              (into phone)
                         It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.
                              (pause)
                         White.
                              (pause)
                         Nothin', except for the mess inside.
                              (pause)
                         About twenty minutes.
                              (pause)
                         Nobody who'll be missed.
                              (pause)
                         You're a good man, Joe. See ya soon.
                              (he looks at Jimmie)
                         How we comin', Jimmie?

               Jimmie comes over with a handful of linen.

                                     JIMMIE
                         Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand 
                         somethin' 

                                     THE WOLF
                          Winston, Jimmie  please, Winston.

                                     JIMMIE
                         You gotta understand something, 
                         Winston. I want to help you guys out 
                         and all, but that's my best linen. 
                         It was a wedding present from my 
                         Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny, and 
                         they ain't with us anymore 

                                     THE WOLF
                          let me ask you a question, if you 
                         don't mind?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Sure.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Were you Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny 
                         millionaires?

                                     JIMMIE
                         No.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Well, your Uncle Marsellus is. And 
                         I'm positive if Uncle Conrad and 
                         Aunt Ginny were millionaires, they 
                         would've furnished you with a whole 
                         bedroom set, which your Uncle 
                         Marsellus is more than happy to do.
                              (takes out a roll of 
                              bills)
                         I like oak myself, that's what's in 
                         my bedroom. How 'bout you Jimmie, 
                         you an oak man?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Oak's nice.

               INT. GARAGE  MORNING

               Both Jules and Vincent are inside the car cleaning it up. 
               Vincent is in the front seat washing windows, while Jules is 
               in the backseat, picking up little pieces of skull and gobs 
               of brain.

               Both are twice as bloody as they were before.

                                     JULES
                         I will never forgive your ass for 
                         this shit. This is some fucked-up 
                         repugnant shit!

                                     VINCENT
                         Did you ever hear the philosophy 
                         that once a man admits he's wrong, 
                         he's immediately forgiven for all 
                         wrong-doings?

                                     JULES
                         Man, get outta my face with that 
                         shit! The motherfucker who said that 
                         never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces 
                         of skull with his fingers on account 
                         of your dumb ass.

                                     VINCENT
                         I got a threshold, Jules. I got a 
                         threshold for the abuse I'll take. 
                         And you're crossin' it. I'm a race 
                         car and you got me in the red. Redline 
                         7000, that's where you are. Just 
                         know, it's fuckin' dangerous to be 
                         drivin' a race car when it's in the 
                         red. It could blow.

                                     JULES
                         You're gettin' ready to blow? I'm a 
                         mushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker!  
                         Every time my fingers touch brain 
                         I'm "SUPERFLY T.N.T," I'm the "GUNS 
                         OF NAVARONE." I'm what Jimmie Walker 
                         usta talk about. In fact, what the 
                         fuck am I doin' in the back?  You're 
                         the motherfucker should be on brain 
                         detail. We're tradin'. I'm washin' 
                         windows and you're pickin' up this 
                         nigger's skull.

               INT. CHEVY NOVA  MORNING

               The interior of the car has been cleaned and lined with 
               bedspreads and quilts. Believe it or not, what looked like a 
               portable slaughterhouse can actually pass for a non-descript 
               vehicle.

               The Wolf circles the car examining it.

               Jules and Vincent stand aside, their clothes are literally a 
               bloody mess, but they do have a sense of pride in what a 
               good job they've done.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Fine job, gentlemen. We may get out 
                         of this yet.

                                     JIMMIE
                         I can't believe that's the same car.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Well, let's not start suckin' each 
                         other's dicks quite yet. Phase one 
                         is complete, clean the car, which 
                         moves us right along to phase two, 
                         clean you two.

               EXT. JIMMIE'S BACKYARD  MORNING

               Jules and Vincent stand side by side in their black suits, 
               covered in blood, in Jimmie's backyard. Jimmie holds a plastic 
               Hefty trash bag, while The Wolf holds a garden hose with one 
               of those guns nozzles attached.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Strip.

                                     VINCENT
                         All the way?

                                     THE WOLF
                         To your bare ass.

               As they follow directions, The Wolf enjoys a smoke.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Quickly gentlemen, we got about 
                         fifteen minutes before Jimmie's better-
                         half comes pulling into the driveway.

                                     JULES
                         This morning air is some chilly shit.

                                     VINCENT
                         Are you sure this is absolutely 
                         necessary?

                                     THE WOLF
                         You know what you two look like?

                                     VINCENT
                         What?

                                     THE WOLF
                         Like a couple of guys who just blew 
                         off somebody's head. Yes, strippin' 
                         off those bloody rags is absolutely 
                         necessary. Toss the clothes in Jim's 
                         garbage bag.

                                     JULES
                         Now Jimmie, don't do nothin' stupid 
                         like puttin' that out in front of 
                         your house for Elmo the garbage man 
                         to take away.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Don't worry, we're takin' it with 
                         us. Jim, the soap.

               He hands the now-naked men a bar of soap.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Okay gentlemen, you're both been to 
                         County before, I'm sure. Here it 
                         comes.

               He hits the trigger, water SHOOTS OUT, SMACKING both men.

                                     JULES
                         Goddamn, that water's fuckin' cold!

                                     THE WOLF
                         Better you than me, gentlemen.

               The two men, trembling, scrub themselves.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Don't be afraid of the soap, spread 
                         it around.

               The Wolf stops the hose, tossing it on the ground.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Towel 'em.

               Jimmie tosses them each a towel, which they rub furiously 
               across their bodies.

                                     THE WOLF
                         You're dry enough, give 'em their 
                         clothes.

               FADE UP ON:

               JULES AND VINCENT In their tee-shirts and swim trunks. They 
               look a million miles away from the black-suited, bad-asses 
               we first met.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Perfect. Perfect. We couldn't've 
                         planned this better. You guys look 
                         like... what do they look like, 
                         Jimmie?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Dorks. They look like a couple of 
                         dorks.

               The Wolf and Jimmie laugh.

                                     JULES
                         Ha ha ha. They're your clothes, 
                         motherfucker.

                                     JIMMIE
                         I guess you just gotta know how to 
                         wear them.

                                     JULES
                         Yeah, well, our asses ain't the expert 
                         on wearin' dorky shit that your is.

                                     THE WOLF
                         C'mon, gentlemen, we're laughin' and 
                         jokin' our way into prison. Don't 
                         make me beg.

               INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE  MORNING

               The garbage bag is tossed in the car trunk on top of Marvin. 
               The Wolf SLAMS is closed.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Gentlemen, let's get our rules of 
                         the road straight. We're going to a 
                         place called Monster Joe's Truck and 
                         Tow. Monster Joe and his daughter 
                         Raquel are sympathetic to out dilemma.  
                         The place is North Hollywood, so a 
                         few twist and turns aside, we'll be 
                         goin' up Hollywood Way. Now I'll 
                         drive the tainted car. Jules, you 
                         ride with me.  Vincent, you follow 
                         in my Porsche. Now if we cross the 
                         path of any John Q. Laws, nobody 
                         does a fuckin' thing 'til I do 
                         something.

                                     (TO JULES)
                         What did I say?

                                     JULES
                         Don't do shit unless 

                                     THE WOLF
                          unless what?

                                     JULES
                         Unless you do it first.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Spoken like a true prodigy.
                              (to Vincent)
                         How 'bout you, Lash Larue?  Can you 
                         keep your spurs from jingling and 
                         jangling?

                                     VINCENT
                         I'm cool, Mr. Wolf. My gun just went 
                         off, I dunno how.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Fair enough.
                              (he throws Vince his 
                              car keys)
                         I drive real fuckin' fast, so keep 
                         up. If I get my car back any different 
                         than I gave it, Monster Joe's gonna 
                         be disposing of two bodies.

               EXT. MONSTER JOE'S TRUCK AND TOW  MORNING

               Jules and Vincent wait by Winston's Porsche.

                                     JULES
                         We cool?

                                     WINSTON
                         Like it never happened.

               Jules and Vincent bump fists.

                                     WINSTON
                         Boys, this is Raquel. Someday, all 
                         this will be hers.

                                     RAQUEL
                              (to the boys)
                         Hi. You know, if they ever do "I 
                         SPY: THE MOTION PICTURE," you guys, 
                         I'd be great.  What's with the 
                         outfits. You guys going to a 
                         volleyball game?

               Winston laughs, the boys groan.

                                     WINSTON
                         I'm takin' m'lady out to breakfast. 
                         Maybe I can drop you two off. Where 
                         do you live?

                                     VINCENT
                         Redondo Beach.

                                     JULES
                         Inglewood.

               Winston grabs Jules' wrist and pantomimes like he's in a 
               "DEAD ZONE" trance.

                                     WINSTON
                              (painfully)
                         It's your future: I see... a cab 
                         ride.
                              (dropping the act)
                         Sorry guys, move out of the sticks.
                              (to Raquel)
                         Say goodbye, Raquel.

                                     RAQUEL
                         Goodbye, Raquel.

                                     WINSTON
                         I'll see you two around, and stay 
                         outta trouble, you crazy kids.

               Winston turns to leave.

                                     JULES
                         Mr. Wolf.

               He turns around.

                                     JULES
                         I was a pleasure watchin' you work.

               The Wolf smiles.

                                     WINSTON
                         Call me Winston.

               He turns and banters with Raquel as they get in the Porsche.

                                     WINSTON
                         You hear that, young lady? Respect. 
                         You could lean a lot from those two 
                         fine specimens. Respect for one's 
                         elders shows character.

                                     RAQUEL
                         I have character.

                                     WINSTON
                         Just because you are a character 
                         doesn't mean you have character.

                                     RAQUEL
                         Oh you're so funny, oh you're so 
                         funny.

               The Porsche SHOOTS OFF down the road.

               The two men left alone look at each other.

                                     JULES
                         Wanna share a cab?

                                     VINCENT
                         You know I could go for some 
                         breakfast.  Want to have breakfast 
                         with me?

                                     JULES
                         Sure.

               INT. COFFEE SHOP  MORNING

               Jules and Vincent sit at a booth. In front of Vincent is a 
               big stack of pancakes and sausages, which he eats with gusto. 
               Jules, on the other hand, just has a cup of coffee and a 
               muffin. He seems far away in thought. The Waitress pours a 
               refill for both men,

                                     VINCENT
                         Thanks a bunch.
                              (to Jules, who's 
                              nursing his coffee)
                         Want a sausage?

                                     JULES
                         Naw, I don't eat pork.

                                     VINCENT
                         Are you Jewish?

                                     JULES
                         I ain't Jewish man, I just don't dig 
                         on swine.

                                     VINCENT
                         Why not?

                                     JULES
                         They're filthy animals. I don't eat 
                         filthy animals.

                                     VINCENT
                         Sausages taste good. Pork chops taste 
                         good.

                                     JULES
                         A sewer rat may taste like pumpkin 
                         pie.  I'll never know 'cause even if 
                         it did, I wouldn't eat the filthy 
                         motherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in 
                         shit. That's a filthy animal. I don't 
                         wanna eat nothin' that ain't got 
                         enough sense to disregard its own 
                         feces.

                                     VINCENT
                         How about dogs? Dogs eat their own 
                         feces.

                                     JULES
                         I don't eat dog either.

                                     VINCENT
                         Yes, but do you consider a dog to be 
                         a filthy animal?

                                     JULES
                         I wouldn't go so far as to call a 
                         dog filthy, but they're definitely 
                         dirty. But a dog's got personality. 
                         And personality goes a long way.

                                     VINCENT
                         So by that rationale, if a pig had a 
                         better personality, he's cease to be 
                         a filthy animal?

                                     JULES
                         We'd have to be talkin' 'bout one 
                         motherfuckin' charmin' pig. It'd 
                         have to be the Cary Grant of pigs.

               The two men laugh.

                                     VINCENT
                         Good for you. Lighten up a little. 
                         You been sittin' there all quiet.

                                     JULES
                         I just been sittin' here thinkin'.

                                     VINCENT
                              (mouthful of food)
                         About what?

                                     JULES
                         The miracle we witnessed.

                                     VINCENT
                         The miracle you witnessed. I witnessed 
                         a freak occurrence.

                                     JULES
                         Do you know that a miracle is?

                                     VINCENT
                         An act of God.

                                     JULES
                         What's an act of God?

                                     VINCENT
                         I guess it's when God makes the 
                         impossible possible. And I'm sorry 
                         Jules, but I don't think what happened 
                         this morning qualifies.

                                     JULES
                         Don't you see, Vince, that shit don't 
                         matter. You're judging this thing 
                         the wrong way. It's not about what. 
                         It could be God stopped the bullets, 
                         he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found 
                         my fuckin' car keys. You don't judge 
                         shit like this based on merit. Whether 
                         or not what we experienced was an 
                         according-to-Hoyle miracle is 
                         insignificant. What is significant 
                         is I felt God's touch, God got 
                         involved.

                                     VINCENT
                         But why?

                                     JULES
                         That's what's fuckin' wit' me! I 
                         don't know why. But I can't go back 
                         to sleep.

                                     VINCENT
                         So you're serious, you're really 
                         gonna quit?

                                     JULES
                         The life, most definitely.

               Vincent takes a bite of food. Jules takes a sip of coffee In 
               the b.g., we see a PATRON call the Waitress.

                                     PATRON
                         Garcon! Coffee!

               We recognize the patron to be Pumpkin from the first scene 
               of Pumpkin and Honey Bunny.

                                     VINCENT
                         So if you're quitting the life, 
                         what'll you do?

                                     JULES
                         That's what I've been sitting here 
                         contemplating. First, I'm gonna 
                         deliver this case to Marsellus. Then, 
                         basically, I'm gonna walk the earth.

                                     VINCENT
                         What do you mean, walk the earth?

                                     JULES
                         You know, like Caine in "KUNG FU." 
                         Just walk from town to town, meet 
                         people, get in adventures.

                                     VINCENT
                         How long do you intend to walk the 
                         earth?

                                     JULES
                         Until God puts me where he want me 
                         to be.

                                     VINCENT
                         What if he never does?

                                     JULES
                         If it takes forever, I'll wait 
                         forever.

                                     VINCENT
                         So you decided to be a bum?

                                     JULES
                         I'll just be Jules, Vincent  no 
                         more, no less.

                                     VINCENT
                         No Jules, you're gonna be like those 
                         pieces of shit out there who beg for 
                         change. They walk around like a bunch 
                         of fuckin' zombies, they sleep in 
                         garbage bins, they eat what I throw 
                         away, and dogs piss on 'em. They got 
                         a word for 'em, they're called bums. 
                         And without a job, residence, or 
                         legal tender, that's what you're 
                         gonna be  a fuckin' bum!

                                     JULES
                         Look my friend, this is just where 
                         me and you differ 

                                     VINCENT
                          what happened was peculiar  no 
                         doubt about it  but it wasn't water 
                         into wine.

                                     JULES
                         All shapes and sizes, Vince.

                                     VINCENT
                         Stop fuckin' talkin' like that!

                                     JULES
                         If you find my answers frightening, 
                         Vincent, you should cease askin' 
                         scary questions.

                                     VINCENT
                         I gotta take a shit. To be continued.

               Vincent exits for the restroom.

               Jules, alone, takes a mouthful of muffin, then... Pumpkin 
               and Honey Bunny rise with guns raised.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Everybody be cool, this is a robbery!

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Any of you fuckin' pricks move and 
                         I'll execute every one of you 
                         motherfuckers!  Got that?!

               Jules looks up, not believing what he's seeing. Under the 
               table, Jules' hand goes to his .45 Automatic. He pulls it 
               out, COCKING IT.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Customers stay seated, waitresses on 
                         the floor.

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Now mean fuckin' now! Do it or die, 
                         do it or fucking die!

               Like lightning, Pumpkin moves over to the kitchen. While 
               Honey Bunny SCREAMS out threats to the PATRONS, keeping them 
               terrified.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         You Mexicans in the kitchen, get out 
                         here!  Asta luego!

               Three COOKS and two BUSBOYS come out of the kitchen.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         On the floor or I'll cook you ass, 
                         comprende?

               They comprende. The portly MANAGER speaks up.

                                     MANAGER
                         I'm the manager here, there's no 
                         problem, no problem at all 

               Pumpkin heads his way.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         You're gonna give me a problem?

               He reaches him and sticks the barrel of his gun hard in the 
               Manager's neck.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         What? You said you're gonna give me 
                         a problem?

                                     MANAGER
                         No, I'm not. I'm not gonna give you 
                         any problem!

                                     PUMPKIN
                         I don't know, Honey Bunny. He looks 
                         like the hero type to me!

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Don't take any chances. Execute him!

               The Patrons SCREAM. Jules watches all this silently, his 
               hand tightly gripping the .45 Automatic under the table.

                                     MANAGER
                         Please don't! I'm not a hero. I'm 
                         just a coffee shop manager. Take 
                         anything you want.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Tell everyone to cooperate and it'll 
                         be all over.

                                     MANAGER
                         Everybody just be calm and cooperate 
                         with them and this will be all over 
                         soon!

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Well done, now git your fuckin' ass 
                         on the ground.

               INT. COFFEE SHOP BATHROOM  MORNING

               Vincent, on the toilet, oblivious to the pandemonium outside, 
               reads his "MODESTY BLAISE" book.

               INT. COFFEE SHOP  MORNING

               Cash register drawer opens. Pumpkin stuffs the money from 
               the till in his pocket. Then walks from behind the counter 
               with a trash bag in his hand.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Okay people, I'm going to go 'round 
                         and collect your wallets. Don't talk, 
                         just toss 'em in the bag. We clear?

               Pumpkin goes around collecting wallets. Jules sits with his 
               .45 ready to spit under the table.

               Pumpkin sees Jules sitting in his booth, holding his wallet, 
               briefcase next to him. Pumpkin crosses to him, his tone more 
               respectful, him manner more on guard.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         In the bag.

               Jules DROPS his wallet in the bag. Using his gun as a pointer, 
               Pumpkin points to the briefcase.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         What's in that?

                                     JULES
                         My boss' dirty laundry.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         You boss makes you do his laundry?

                                     JULES
                         When he wants it clean.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Sounds like a shit job.

                                     JULES
                         Funny, I've been thinkin' the same 
                         thing.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Open it up.

               Jules' free hand lays palm flat on the briefcase.

                                     JULES
                         'Fraid I can't do that.

               Pumpkin is definitely surprised by his answer. He aims the 
               gun right in the middle of Jules' face and pulls back the 
               hammer.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         I didn't hear you.

                                     JULES
                         Yes, you did.

               This exchange has been kind of quiet, not everybody heard 
               it, but Honey Bunny senses something's wrong.

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         What's goin' on?

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Looks like we got a vigilante in our 
                         midst.

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Shoot 'em in the face!

                                     JULES
                         I don't mean to shatter your ego, 
                         but this ain't the first time I've 
                         had gun pointed at me.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         You don't open up that case, it's 
                         gonna be the last.

                                     MANAGER
                              (on the ground)
                         Quit causing problems, you'll get us 
                         all killed! Give 'em what you got 
                         and get 'em out of here.

                                     JULES
                         Keep your fuckin' mouth closed, fat 
                         man, this ain't any of your goddamn 
                         business!

                                     PUMPKIN
                         I'm countin' to three, and if your 
                         hand ain't off that case, I'm gonna 
                         unload right in your fuckin' face. 
                         Clear? One...

                                     PUMPKIN
                         ...two... three.

                                     JULES
                         You win.

               Jules raises his hand off the briefcase.

                                     JULES
                         It's all yours, Ringo.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Open it.

               Jules flips the locks and opens the case, revealing it to 
               Pumpkin but not to us. The same light SHINES from the case. 
               Pumpkin's expression goes to amazement. Honey Bunny, across 
               the room, can't see shit.

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         What is it? What is it?

                                     PUMPKIN
                              (softly)
                         Is that what I think it is?

               Jules nods his head: "yes."

                                     PUMPKIN
                         It's beautiful.

               Jules nods his head: "yes."

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Goddammit, what is it?

               Jules SLAMS the case closed, then sits back, as if offering 
               the case to Pumpkin. Pumpkin, one big smile, bends over to 
               pick up the case.

               Like a rattlesnake, Jules' free hand GRABS the wrist of 
               Pumpkin's gun hand, SLAMMING it on the table. His other hand 
               comes from under the table and STICKS the barrel of his .45 
               hand under Pumpkin's chin.

               Honey Bunny freaks out, waving her gun in Jules' direction.

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Let him go! Let him go! I'll blow 
                         your fuckin' head off! I'll kill ya! 
                         I'll kill ya! You're gonna die, you're 
                         gonna fuckin' die bad!

                                     JULES
                              (to Pumpkin)
                         Tell that bitch to be cool! Say, 
                         bitch be cool! Say, bitch be cool!

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Chill out, honey!

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Let him go!

                                     JULES
                              (softly)
                         Tell her it's gonna be okay.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         I'm gonna be okay.

                                     JULES
                         Promise her.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         I promise.

                                     JULES
                         Tell her to chill.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Just chill out.

                                     JULES
                         What's her name?

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Yolanda.

               Whenever Jules talks to Yolanda, he never looks at her, only 
               at Pumpkin.

                                     JULES
                              (to Yolanda)
                         So, we cool Yolanda? We ain't gonna 
                         do anything stupid, are we?

                                     YOLANDA
                              (crying)
                         Don't you hurt him.

                                     JULES
                         Nobody's gonna hurt anybody. We're 
                         gonna be like three Fonzies. And 
                         what' Fonzie like?

               No answer.

                                     JULES
                         C'mon Yolanda, what's Fonzie like?

                                     YOLANDA
                              (through tears, unsure)
                         He's cool?

                                     JULES
                         Correct-amundo! And that's what we're 
                         gonna be, we're gonna be cool.
                              (to Pumpkin)
                         Now Ringo, I'm gonna count to three 
                         and I want you to let go your gun 
                         and lay your palms flat on the table. 
                         But when you do it, do it cool. Ready?

               Pumpkin looks at him.

                                     JULES
                         One... two... three.

               Pumpkin lets go of his gun and places both hands on the table.

               Yolanda can't stand it anymore.

                                     YOLANDA
                         Okay, now let him go!

                                     JULES
                         Yolanda, I thought you were gonna be 
                         cool.  When you yell at me, it makes 
                         me nervous.  When I get nervous, I 
                         get scared. And when motherfuckers 
                         get scared, that's when motherfuckers 
                         get accidentally shot.

                                     YOLANDA
                              (more conversational)
                         Just know: you hurt him, you die.

                                     JULES
                         That seems to be the situation. Now 
                         I don't want that and you don't want 
                         that and Ringo here don't want that. 
                         So let's see what we can do.
                              (to Ringo)
                         Now this is the situation. Normally 
                         both of your asses would be dead as 
                         fuckin' fried chicken. But you 
                         happened to pull this shit while I'm 
                         in a transitional period. I don't 
                         wanna kill ya, I want to help ya. 
                         But I'm afraid I can't give you the 
                         case. It don't belong to me. Besides, 
                         I went through too much shit this 
                         morning on account of this case to 
                         just hand it over to your ass.

                                     VINCENT (O.S.)
                         What the fuck's goin' on here?

               Yolanda WHIPS her gun toward the stranger.

               Vincent, by the bathroom, has his gun out, dead-aimed at 
               Yolanda.

                                     JULES
                         It's cool, Vincent! It's cool! Don't 
                         do a goddamn thing. Yolanda, it's 
                         cool baby, nothin's changed. We're 
                         still just talkin'.
                              (to Pumpkin)
                         Tell her we're still cool.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         It's cool, Honey Bunny, we're still 
                         cool.

                                     VINCENT
                              (gun raised)
                         What the hell's goin' on, Jules?

                                     JULES
                         Nothin' I can't handle. I want you 
                         to just hang back and don't do shit 
                         unless it's absolutely necessary.

                                     VINCENT
                         Check.

                                     JULES
                         Yolanda, how we doin, baby?

                                     YOLANDA
                         I gotta go pee! I want to go home.

                                     JULES
                         Just hang in there, baby, you're 
                         doing' great, Ringo's proud of you 
                         and so am I.  It's almost over.
                              (to Pumpkin)
                         Now I want you to go in that bag and 
                         find my wallet.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Which one is it?

                                     JULES
                         It's the one that says Bad 
                         Motherfucker on it.

               Pumpkin looks in the bag and  sure enough  there's a wallet 
               with "Bad Motherfucker" embroidered on it.

                                     JULES
                         That's my bad motherfucker. Now open 
                         it up and take out the cash. How 
                         much is there?

                                     PUMPKIN
                         About fifteen hundred dollars.

                                     JULES
                         Put it in your pocket, it's yours. 
                         Now with the rest of them wallets 
                         and the register, that makes this a 
                         pretty successful little score.

                                     VINCENT
                         Jules, if you give this nimrod fifteen 
                         hundred buck, I'm gonna shoot 'em on 
                         general principle.

                                     JULES
                         You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing, 
                         now hang back and shut the fuck up. 
                         Besides, I ain't givin' it to him. 
                         I'm buyin' somethin' for my money. 
                         Wanna know what I'm buyin' Ringo?

                                     PUMPKIN
                         What?

                                     JULES
                         Your life. I'm givin' you that money 
                         so I don't hafta kill your ass. You 
                         read the Bible?

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Not regularly.

                                     JULES
                         There's a passage I got memorized. 
                         Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the 
                         righteous man is beset on all sides 
                         by the inequities of the selfish and 
                         the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is 
                         he who, in the name of charity and 
                         good will, shepherds the weak through 
                         the valley of the darkness. For he 
                         is truly his brother's keeper and 
                         the finder of lost children. And I 
                         will strike down upon thee with great 
                         vengeance and furious anger those 
                         who attempt to poison and destroy my 
                         brothers. And you will know I am the 
                         Lord when I lay my vengeance upon 
                         you." I been sayin' that shit for 
                         years.  And if you ever heard it, it 
                         meant your ass. I never really 
                         questioned what it meant. I thought 
                         it was just a coldblooded thing to 
                         say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped 
                         a cap in his ass. But I saw some 
                         shit this mornin' made me think twice. 
                         Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're 
                         the evil man. And I'm the righteous 
                         man.  And Mr. .45 here, he's the 
                         shepherd protecting my righteous ass 
                         in the valley of darkness. Or is 
                         could by you're the righteous man 
                         and I'm the shepherd and it's the 
                         world that's evil and selfish.  I'd 
                         like that. But that shit ain't the 
                         truth. The truth is you're the weak. 
                         And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But 
                         I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to 
                         be a shepherd.

               Jules lowers his gun, lying it on the table.

               Pumpkin looks at him, to the money in his hand, then to 
               Yolanda.

               She looks back.

               Grabbing the trash bag full of wallets, the two RUN out the 
               door.

               Jules, who was never risen from his seat the whole time, 
               takes a sip of coffee.

                                     JULES
                              (to himself)
                         It's cold.

               He pushes it aside.

               Vincent appears next to Jules.

                                     VINCENT
                         I think we oughta leave now.

                                     JULES
                         That's probably a good idea.

               Vincent throws some money on the table and Jules grabs the 
               briefcase.

               Then, to the amazement of the Patrons, the Waitresses, the 
               Cooks, the Bus Boys, and the Manager, these two bad-ass dudes 
                wearing UC Santa Cruz and "I'm with Stupid" tee-shirts, 
               swim trunks, thongs and packing .45 Automatics  walk out of 
               the coffee shop together without saying a word.

                                                                   FADE OUT

                                         THE END

               INT. COFFEE SHOP  MORNING

               A normal Denny's, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles. 
               It's about 9:00 in the morning. While the place isn't jammed, 
               there's a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching 
               on bacon and eating eggs.

               Two of these people are a YOUNG MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN. The 
               Young Man has a slight working-class English accent and, 
               like his fellow countryman, smokes cigarettes like they're 
               going out of style.

               It is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or 
               how old she is; everything she does contradicts something 
               she did. The boy and girl sit in a booth. Their dialogue is 
               to be said in a rapid pace "HIS GIRL FRIDAY" fashion.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm 
                         through doin' that shit.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         You always say that, the same thing 
                         every time: never again, I'm through, 
                         too dangerous.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I know that's what I always say. I'm 
                         always right too, but 

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                          but you forget about it in a day 
                         or two -

                                     YOUNG MAN
                          yeah, well, the days of me 
                         forgittin' are over, and the days of 
                         me rememberin' have just begun.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         When you go on like this, you know 
                         what you sound like?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I sound like a sensible fucking man, 
                         is what I sound like.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         You sound like a duck.
                              (imitates a duck)
                         Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, 
                         quack, quack...

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Well take heart, 'cause you're never 
                         gonna hafta hear it again. Because 
                         since I'm never gonna do it again, 
                         you're never gonna hafta hear me 
                         quack about how I'm never gonna do 
                         it again.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         After tonight.

               The boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in 
               there, back and forth.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                              (with a smile)
                         Correct. I got all tonight to quack.

               A WAITRESS comes by with a pot of coffee.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Can I get anybody anymore coffee?

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Oh yes, thank you.

               The Waitress pours the Young Woman's coffee. The Young Man 
               lights up another cigarette.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I'm doin' fine.

               The Waitress leaves. The Young Man takes a drag off of his 
               smoke.

               The Young Woman pours a ton of cream and sugar into her 
               coffee.

               The Young Man goes right back into it.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I mean the way it is now, you're 
                         takin' the same fuckin' risk as when 
                         you rob a bank. You take more of a 
                         risk. Banks are easier!  Federal 
                         banks aren't supposed to stop you 
                         anyway, during a robbery. They're 
                         insured, why should they care? You 
                         don't even need a gun in a federal 
                         bank. I heard about this guy, walked 
                         into a federal bank with a portable 
                         phone, handed the phone to the teller, 
                         the guy on the other end of the phone 
                         said: "We got this guy's little girl, 
                         and if you don't give him all your 
                         money, we're gonna kill 'er."

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Did it work?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Fuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm 
                         talkin' about! Knucklehead walks in 
                         a bank with a telephone, not a pistol, 
                         not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone, 
                         cleans the place out, and they don't 
                         lift a fuckin' finger.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Did they hurt the little girl?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I don't know. There probably never 
                         was a little girl  the point of the 
                         story isn't the little girl. The 
                         point of the story is they robbed 
                         the bank with a telephone.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         You wanna rob banks?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks, 
                         I'm just illustrating that if we 
                         did, it would be easier than what we 
                         been doin'.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         So you don't want to be a bank robber?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Naw, all those guys are goin' down 
                         the same road, either dead or servin' 
                         twenty.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         And no more liquor stores?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         What have we been talking about? 
                         Yeah, no more-liquor-stores. Besides, 
                         it ain't the giggle it usta be. Too 
                         many foreigners own liquor stores. 
                         Vietnamese, Koreans, they can't 
                         fuckin' speak English. You tell 'em: 
                         "Empty out the register," and they 
                         don't know what it fuckin' means. 
                         They make it too personal. We keep 
                         on, one of those gook motherfuckers' 
                         gonna make us kill 'em.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         I'm not gonna kill anybody.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I don't wanna kill anybody either. 
                         But they'll probably put us in a 
                         situation where it's us of them. And 
                         if it's not the gooks, it these old 
                         Jews who've owned the store for 
                         fifteen fuckin' generations. Ya got 
                         Grandpa Irving sittin' behind the 
                         counter with a fuckin' Magnum. Try 
                         walkin' into one of those stores 
                         with nothin' but a telephone, see 
                         how far it gets you. Fuck it, forget 
                         it, we're out of it.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Well, what else is there, day jobs?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                              (laughing)
                         Not this life.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Well what then?

               He calls to the Waitress.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Garcon! Coffee!

               Then looks to his girl.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         This place.

               The Waitress comes by, pouring him some more.

                                     WAITRESS
                              (snotty)
                         "Garcon" means boy.

               She splits.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Here? It's a coffee shop.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         What's wrong with that? People never 
                         rob restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor 
                         stores, gas stations, you get your 
                         head blown off stickin' up one of 
                         them. Restaurants, on the other hand, 
                         you catch with their pants down. 
                         They're not expecting to get robbed, 
                         or not as expecting.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                              (taking to idea)
                         I bet in places like this you could 
                         cut down on the hero factor.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Correct. Just like banks, these places 
                         are insured. The managers don't give 
                         a fuck, they're just tryin' to get 
                         ya out the door before you start 
                         pluggin' diners.  Waitresses, forget 
                         it, they ain't takin' a bullet for 
                         the register. Busboys, some wetback 
                         gettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour 
                         gonna really give a fuck you're 
                         stealin' from the owner. Customers 
                         are sittin' there with food in their 
                         mouths, they don't know what's goin' 
                         on. One minute they're havin' a Denver 
                         omelet, next minute somebody's 
                         stickin' a gun in their face.

               The Young Woman visibly takes in the idea. The Young Man 
               continues in a low voice.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         See, I got the idea last liquor store 
                         we stuck up. 'Member all those 
                         customers kept comin' in?

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Yeah.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Then you got the idea to take 
                         everybody's wallet.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Uh-huh.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         That was a good idea.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Thanks.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         We made more from the wallets then 
                         we did the register.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Yes we did.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         A lot of people go to restaurants.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         A lot of wallets.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Pretty smart, huh?

               The Young Woman scans the restaurant with this new 
               information.

               She sees all the PATRONS eating, lost in conversations. The 
               tired WAITRESS, taking orders. The BUSBOYS going through the 
               motions, collecting dishes. The MANAGER complaining to the 
               COOK about something. A smiles breaks out on the Young Woman's 
               face.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Pretty smart.
                              (into it)
                         I'm ready, let's go, right here, 
                         right now.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Remember, same as before, you're 
                         crowd control, I handle the employees.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Got it.

               They both take out their .32-caliber pistols and lay them on 
               the table. He looks at her and she back at him.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         I love you, Pumpkin.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I love you, Honey Bunny.

               And with that, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny grab their weapons, 
               stand up and rob the restaurant. Pumpkin's robbery persona 
               is that of the in-control professional. Honey Bunny's is 
               that of the psychopathic, hair-triggered, loose cannon.

                                     PUMPKIN
                              (yelling to all)
                         Everybody be cool this is a robbery!

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Any of you fuckin' pricks move and 
                         I'll execute every one of you

                                      "PULP FICTION"

               INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING)  MORNING

               An old gas guzzling, dirty, white 1974 Chevy Nova BARRELS 
               down a homeless-ridden street in Hollywood. In the front 
               seat are two young fellas  one white, one black  both 
               wearing cheap black suits with thin black ties under long 
               green dusters. Their names are VINCENT VEGA (white) and JULES 
               WINNFIELD (black). Jules is behind the wheel.

                                     JULES
                          Okay now, tell me about the hash 
                         bars?

                                     VINCENT
                         What so you want to know?

                                     JULES
                         Well, hash is legal there, right?

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a 
                         hundred percent legal. I mean you 
                         can't walk into a restaurant, roll a 
                         joint, and start puffin' away. You're 
                         only supposed to smoke in your home 
                         or certain designated places.

                                     JULES
                         Those are hash bars?

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah, it breaks down like this: it's 
                         legal to buy it, it's legal to own 
                         it and, if you're the proprietor of 
                         a hash bar, it's legal to sell it. 
                         It's legal to carry it, which doesn't 
                         really matter 'cause  get a load of 
                         this  if the cops stop you, it's 
                         illegal for this to search you. 
                         Searching you is a right that the 
                         cops in Amsterdam don't have.

                                     JULES
                         That did it, man  I'm fuckin' goin', 
                         that's all there is to it.

                                     VINCENT
                         You'll dig it the most. But you know 
                         what the funniest thing about Europe 
                         is?

                                     JULES
                         What?

                                     VINCENT
                         It's the little differences. A lotta 
                         the same shit we got here, they got 
                         there, but there they're a little 
                         different.

                                     JULES
                         Examples?

                                     VINCENT
                         Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer 
                         in a movie theatre. And I don't mean 
                         in a paper cup either. They give you 
                         a glass of beer, like in a bar. In 
                         Paris, you can buy beer at 
                         MacDonald's. Also, you know what 
                         they call a Quarter Pounder with 
                         Cheese in Paris?

                                     JULES
                         They don't call it a Quarter Pounder 
                         with Cheese?

                                     VINCENT
                         No, they got the metric system there, 
                         they wouldn't know what the fuck a 
                         Quarter Pounder is.

                                     JULES
                         What'd they call it?

                                     VINCENT
                         Royale with Cheese.

                                     JULES
                              (repeating)
                         Royale with Cheese. What'd they call 
                         a Big Mac?

                                     VINCENT
                         Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call 
                         it Le Big Mac.

                                     JULES
                         Le Big Mac. What do they call a 
                         Whopper?

                                     VINCENT
                         I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger 
                         King.  But you know what they put on 
                         french fries in Holland instead of 
                         ketchup?

                                     JULES
                         What?

                                     VINCENT
                         Mayonnaise.

                                     JULES
                         Goddamn!

                                     VINCENT
                         I seen 'em do it. And I don't mean a 
                         little bit on the side of the plate, 
                         they fuckin' drown 'em in it.

                                     JULES
                         Uuccch!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CHEVY (TRUNK)  MORNING

               The trunk of the Chevy OPENS UP, Jules and Vincent reach 
               inside, taking out two .45 Automatics, loading and cocking 
               them.

                                     JULES
                         We should have shotguns for this 
                         kind of deal.

                                     VINCENT
                         How many up there?

                                     JULES
                         Three or four.

                         Counting our guy?

                         I'm not sure.

                                     VINCENT
                         So there could be five guys up there?

                                     JULES
                         It's possible.

                                     VINCENT
                         We should have fuckin' shotguns.

               They CLOSE the trunk.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING COURTYARD  MORNING

               Vincent and Jules, their long matching overcoats practically 
               dragging on the ground, walk through the courtyard of what 
               looks like a hacienda-style Hollywood apartment building.

               We TRACK alongside.

                                     VINCENT
                         What's her name?

                         Mia.

                                     VINCENT
                         How did Marsellus and her meet?

                                     JULES
                         I dunno, however people meet people. 
                         She usta be an actress.

                                     VINCENT
                         She ever do anything I woulda saw?

                                     JULES
                         I think her biggest deal was she 
                         starred in a pilot.

                                     VINCENT
                         What's a pilot?

                                     JULES
                         Well, you know the shows on TV?

                                     VINCENT
                         I don't watch TV.

                                     JULES
                         Yes, but you're aware that there's 
                         an invention called television, and 
                         on that invention they show shows?

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah.

                                     JULES
                         Well, the way they pick the shows on 
                         TV is they make one show, and that 
                         show's called a pilot. And they show 
                         that one show to the people who pick 
                         the shows, and on the strength of 
                         that one show, they decide if they 
                         want to make more shows. Some get 
                         accepted and become TV programs, and 
                         some don't, and become nothing. She 
                         starred in one of the ones that became 
                         nothing.

               They enter the apartment building.

               INT. RECEPTION AREA (APARTMENT BUILDING)  MORNING

               Vincent and Jules walk through the reception area and wait 
               for the elevator.

                                     JULES
                         You remember Antwan Rockamora? Half-
                         black, half-Samoan, usta call him 
                         Tony Rocky Horror.

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah maybe, fat right?

                                     JULES
                         I wouldn't go so far as to call the 
                         brother fat. He's got a weight 
                         problem.  What's the nigger gonna 
                         do, he's Samoan.

                                     VINCENT
                         I think I know who you mean, what 
                         about him?

                                     JULES
                         Well, Marsellus fucked his ass up 
                         good.  And word around the campfire, 
                         it was on account of Marsellus 
                         Wallace's wife.

               The elevator arrives, the men step inside.

               INT. ELEVATOR  MORNING

                                     VINCENT
                         What'd he do, fuck her?

                                     JULES
                         No no no no no no no, nothin' that 
                         bad.

                                     VINCENT
                         Well what then?

                                     JULES
                         He gave her a foot massage.

                                     VINCENT
                         A foot massage?

               Jules nods his head: "Yes."

                                     VINCENT
                         That's all?

               Jules nods his head: "Yes."

                                     VINCENT
                         What did Marsellus do?

                                     JULES
                         Sent a couple of guys over to his 
                         place.  They took him out on the 
                         patio of his apartment, threw his 
                         ass over the balcony.  Nigger fell 
                         four stories. They had this garden 
                         at the bottom, enclosed in glass, 
                         like one of them greenhouses  nigger 
                         fell through that. Since then, he's 
                         kinda developed a speech impediment.

               The elevator doors open, Jules and Vincent exit.

                                     VINCENT
                         That's a damn shame.

               INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY  MORNING

               STEADICAM in front of Jules and Vincent as they make a beeline 
               down the hall.

                                     VINCENT
                         Still I hafta say, play with matches, 
                         ya get burned.

                                     JULES
                         Whaddya mean?

                                     VINCENT
                         You don't be givin' Marsellus 
                         Wallace's new bride a foot massage.

                                     JULES
                         You don't think he overreacted?

                                     VINCENT
                         Antwan probably didn't expect 
                         Marsellus to react like he did, but 
                         he had to expect a reaction.

                                     JULES
                         It was a foot massage, a foot massage 
                         is nothing, I give my mother a foot 
                         massage.

                                     VINCENT
                         It's laying hands on Marsellus 
                         Wallace's new wife in a familiar 
                         way. Is it as bad as eatin' her out 
                          no, but you're in the same fuckin' 
                         ballpark.

               Jules stops Vincent.

                                     JULES
                         Whoa... whoa... whoa... stop right 
                         there.  Eatin' a bitch out, and givin' 
                         a bitch a foot massage ain't even 
                         the same fuckin' thing.

                                     VINCENT
                         Not the same thing, the same ballpark.

                                     JULES
                         It ain't no ballpark either. Look 
                         maybe your method of massage differs 
                         from mine, but touchin' his lady's 
                         feet, and stickin' your tongue in 
                         her holyiest of holyies, ain't the 
                         same ballpark, ain't the same league, 
                         ain't even the same fuckin' sport.
                         Foot massages don't mean shit.

                                     VINCENT
                         Have you ever given a foot massage?

                                     JULES
                         Don't be tellin' me about foot 
                         massages  I'm the foot fuckin' 
                         master.

                                     VINCENT
                         Given a lot of 'em?

                                     JULES
                         Shit yeah. I got my technique down 
                         man, I don't tickle or nothin'.

                                     VINCENT
                         Have you ever given a guy a foot 
                         massage?

               Jules looks at him a long moment  he's been set up.

                                     JULES
                         Fuck you.

               He starts walking down the hall.  Vincent, smiling, walks a 
               little bit behind.

                                     VINCENT
                         How many?

                                     JULES
                         Fuck you.

                                     VINCENT
                         Would you give me a foot massage  
                         I'm kinda tired.

                                     JULES
                         Man, you best back off, I'm gittin' 
                         pissed  this is the door.

               The two men stand in front of the door numbered "49." They 
               whisper.

                                     JULES
                         What time is it?

                                     VINCENT
                              (checking his watch)
                         Seven-twenty-two in the morning.

                                     JULES
                         It ain't quite time, let's hang back.

               They move a little away from the door, facing each other, 
               still whispering.

                                     JULES
                         Look, just because I wouldn't give 
                         no man a foot massage, don't make it 
                         right for Marsellus to throw Antwan 
                         off a building into a glass-
                         motherfuckin-house, fuckin' up the 
                         way the nigger talks. That ain't 
                         right, man. Motherfucker do that to 
                         me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause 
                         I'd kill'a motherfucker.

                                     VINCENT
                         I'm not sayin' he was right, but 
                         you're sayin' a foot massage don't 
                         mean nothing, and I'm sayin' it does. 
                         I've given a million ladies a million 
                         foot massages and they all meant 
                         somethin'. We act like they don't, 
                         but they do. That's what's so fuckin' 
                         cool about 'em. This sensual thing's 
                         goin' on that nobody's talkin about, 
                         but you know it and she knows it, 
                         fuckin' Marsellus knew it, and Antwan 
                         shoulda known fuckin' better. That's 
                         his fuckin' wife, man. He ain't gonna 
                         have a sense of humor about that 
                         shit.

                                     JULES
                         That's an interesting point, but 
                         let's get into character.

                                     VINCENT
                         What's her name again?

                                     JULES
                         Mia. Why you so interested in big 
                         man's wife?

                                     VINCENT
                         Well, Marsellus is leavin' for Florida 
                         and when he's gone, he wants me to 
                         take care of Mia.

                                     JULES
                         Take care of her?

               Making a gun out of his finger and placing it to his head.

                                     VINCENT
                         Not that! Take her out. Show her a 
                         good time. Don't let her get lonely.

                                     JULES
                         You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace 
                         out on a date?

                                     VINCENT
                         It ain't a date. It's like when you 
                         and your buddy's wife go to a movie 
                         or somethin'. It's just... you know... 
                         good company.

               Jules just looks at him.

                                     VINCENT
                         It's not a date.

               Jules just looks at him.

               INT. APARTMENT (ROOM 49)  MORNING

               THREE YOUNG GUYS, obviously in over their heads, sit at a 
               table with hamburgers, french fries and soda pops laid out.

               One of them flips the LOUD BOLT on the door, opening it to 
               REVEAL Jules and Vincent in the hallway.

                                     JULES
                         Hey kids.

               The two men stroll inside.

               The three young caught-off-guard Guys are:

               MARVIN, the black young man, who open the door, will, as the 
               scene progresses, back into the corner.

               ROGER, a young blond-haired surfer kid with a "Flock of 
               Seagulls" haircut, who has yet to say a word, sits at the 
               table with a big sloppy hamburger in his hand.

               BRETT, a white, preppy-looking sort with a blow-dry haircut.

               Vincent and Jules take in the place, with their hands in 
               their pockets. Jules is the one who does the talking.

                                     JULES
                         How you boys doin'?

               No answer.

                                     JULES
                              (to Brett)
                         Am I trippin', or did I just ask you 
                         a question.

                                     BRETT
                         We're doin' okay.

               As Jules and Brett talk, Vincent moves behind the young Guys.

                                     JULES
                         Do you know who we are?

               Brett shakes his head: "No."

                                     JULES
                         We're associates of your business 
                         partner Marsellus Wallace, you 
                         remember your business partner 
                         dont'ya?

               No answer.

                                     JULES
                              (to Brett)
                         Now I'm gonna take a wild guess here: 
                         you're Brett, right?

                                     BRETT
                         I'm Brett.

                                     JULES
                         I thought so. Well, you remember 
                         your business partner Marsellus 
                         Wallace, dont'ya Brett?

                                     BRETT
                         I remember him.

                                     JULES
                         Good for you. Looks like me and 
                         Vincent caught you at breakfast, 
                         sorry 'bout that.  What'cha eatin'?

                                     BRETT
                         Hamburgers.

                                     JULES
                         Hamburgers. The cornerstone of any 
                         nutritious breakfast. What kinda 
                         hamburgers?

                                     BRETT
                         Cheeseburgers.

                                     JULES
                         No, I mean where did you get'em?
                         MacDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-
                         Box, where?

                                     BRETT
                         Big Kahuna Burger.

                                     JULES
                         Big Kahuna Burger. That's that 
                         Hawaiian burger joint. I heard they 
                         got some tasty burgers. I ain't never 
                         had one myself, how are they?

                                     BRETT
                         They're good.

                                     JULES
                         Mind if I try one of yours?

                                     BRETT
                         No.

                                     JULES
                         Yours is this one, right?

                                     BRETT
                         Yeah.

               Jules grabs the burger and take a bite of it.

                                     JULES
                         Uuummmm, that's a tasty burger.
                              (to Vincent)
                         Vince, you ever try a Big Kahuna 
                         Burger?

                                     VINCENT
                         No.

               Jules holds out the Big Kahuna.

                                     JULES
                         You wanna bite, they're real good.

                                     VINCENT
                         I ain't hungry.

                                     JULES
                         Well, if you like hamburgers give 
                         'em a try sometime. Me, I can't 
                         usually eat 'em 'cause my girlfriend's 
                         a vegetarian. Which more or less 
                         makes me a vegetarian, but I sure 
                         love the taste of a good burger.
                              (to Brett)
                         You know what they call a Quarter 
                         Pounder with Cheese in France?

                                     BRETT
                         No.

                                     JULES
                         Tell 'em, Vincent.

                                     VINCENT
                         Royale with Cheese.

                                     JULES
                         Royale with Cheese, you know why 
                         they call it that?

                                     BRETT
                         Because of the metric system?

                                     JULES
                         Check out the big brain on Brett. 
                         You'a smart motherfucker, that's 
                         right. The metric system.
                              (he points to a fast 
                              food drink cup)
                         What's in this?

                                     BRETT
                         Sprite.

                                     JULES
                         Sprite, good, mind if I have some of 
                         your tasty beverage to wash this 
                         down with?

                                     BRETT
                         Sure.

               Jules grabs the cup and takes a sip.

                                     JULES
                         Uuuuummmm, hit's the spot!
                              (to Roger)
                         You, Flock of Seagulls, you know 
                         what we're here for?

               Roger nods his head: "Yes."

                                     JULES
                         Then why don't you tell my boy here 
                         Vince, where you got the shit hid.

                                     MARVIN
                         It's under the be 

                                     JULES
                          I don't remember askin' you a 
                         goddamn thing.
                              (to Roger)
                         You were sayin'?

                                     ROGER
                         It's under the bed.

               Vincent moves to the bed, reaches underneath it, pulling out 
               a black snap briefcase.

                                     VINCENT
                         Got it.

               Vincent flips the two locks, opening the case. We can't see 
               what's inside, but a small glow emits from the case. Vincent 
               just stares at it, transfixed.

                                     JULES
                         We happy?

               No answer from the transfixed Vincent.

                                     JULES
                         Vincent!

               Vincent looks up at Jules.

                                     JULES
                         We happy?

               Closing the case.

                                     VINCENT
                         We're happy.

                                     BRETT
                              (to Jules)
                         Look, what's your name? I got his 
                         name's Vincent, but what's yours?

                                     JULES
                         My name's Pitt, and you ain't talkin' 
                         your ass outta this shit.

                                     BRETT
                         I just want you to know how sorry we 
                         are about how fucked up things got 
                         between us and Mr. Wallace. When we 
                         entered into this thing, we only had 
                         the best intentions 

               As Brett talks, Jules takes out his gun and SHOOTS Roger 
               three times in the chest, BLOWING him out of his chair.

               Vince smiles to himself. Jules has got style.

               Brett has just shit his pants. He's not crying or whimpering, 
               but he's so full of fear, it's as if his body is imploding.

                                     JULES
                              (to Brett)
                         Oh, I'm sorry. Did that break your 
                         concentration? I didn't mean to do 
                         that.  Please, continue. I believe 
                         you were saying something about "best 
                         intentions."

               Brett can't say a word.

                                     JULES
                         Whatsamatter? Oh, you were through 
                         anyway.  Well, let me retort. Would 
                         you describe for me what Marsellus 
                         Wallace looks like?

               Brett still can't speak.

               Jules SNAPS, SAVAGELY TIPPING the card table over, removing 
               the only barrier between himself and Brett. Brett now sits 
               in a lone chair before Jules like a political prisoner in 
               front of an interrogator.

                                     JULES
                         What country you from!

                                     BRETT
                              (petrified)
                         What?

                                     JULES
                         "What" ain't no country I know! Do 
                         they speak English in "What?"

                                     BRETT
                              (near heart attack)
                         What?

                                     JULES
                         English-motherfucker-can-you-speak-
                         it?

                                     BRETT
                         Yes.

                                     JULES
                         Then you understand what I'm sayin'?

                                     BRETT
                         Yes.

                                     JULES
                         Now describe what Marsellus Wallace 
                         looks like!

                                     BRETT
                              (out of fear)
                         What?

               Jules takes his .45 and PRESSES the barrel HARD in Brett's 
               cheek.

                                     JULES
                         Say "What" again! C'mon, say "What" 
                         again!  I dare ya, I double dare ya 
                         motherfucker, say "What" one more 
                         goddamn time!

               Brett is regressing on the spot.

                                     JULES
                         Now describe to me what Marsellus 
                         Wallace looks like!

               Brett does his best.

                                     BRETT
                         Well he's... he's... black 

                                     JULES
                          go on!

                                     BRETT
                         ...and he's... he's... bald 

                                     JULES
                          does he look like a bitch?!

                                     BRETT
                              (without thinking)
                         What?

               Jules' eyes go to Vincent, Vincent smirks, Jules rolls his 
               eyes and SHOOT Brett in the shoulder.

               Brett SCREAMS, breaking into a SHAKING/TREMBLING SPASM in 
               the chair.

                                     JULES
                         Does-he-look-like-a-bitch?!

                                     BRETT
                              (in agony)
                         No.

                                     JULES
                         Then why did you try to fuck 'im 
                         like a bitch?!

                                     BRETT
                              (in spasm)
                         I didn't.

               Now in a lower voice.

                                     JULES
                         Yes ya did Brett. Ya tried ta fuck 
                         'im.  You ever read the Bible, Brett?

                                     BRETT
                              (in spasm)
                         Yes.

                         There's a passage I got memorized, 
                         seems appropriate for this situation: 
                         Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the 
                         righteous man is beset on all sides 
                         by the inequities of the selfish and 
                         the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is 
                         he who, in the name of charity and 
                         good will, shepherds the weak through 
                         the valley of darkness, for he is 
                         truly his brother's keeper and the 
                         finder of lost children. And I will 
                         strike down upon thee with great 
                         vengeance and furious anger those 
                         who attempt to poison and destroy my 
                         brothers. And you will know my name 
                         is the Lord when I lay my vengeance 
                         upon you."

               The two men EMPTY their guns at the same time on the sitting 
               Brett.

               FADE IN:

               MEDIUM SHOT  BUTCH COOLIDGE

               We FADE UP on BUTCH COOLIDGE, a white, 26-year-old 
               prizefighter.  Butch sits at a table wearing a red and blue 
               high school athletic jacket. Talking to him OFF SCREEN is 
               everybody's boss MARSELLUS WALLACE. The black man sounds 
               like a cross between a gangster and a king.

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)
                         I think you're gonna find  when all 
                         this shit is over and done  I think 
                         you're gonna find yourself one smilin' 
                         motherfucker. Thing is Butch, right 
                         now you got ability. But painful as 
                         it may be, ability don't last. Now 
                         that's a hard motherfuckin' fact of 
                         life, but it's a fact of life your 
                         ass is gonna hafta git realistic 
                         about. This business is filled to 
                         the brim with unrealistic 
                         motherfuckers who thought their ass 
                         aged like wine.  Besides, even if 
                         you went all the way, what would you 
                         be? Feather-weight champion of the 
                         world. Who gives a shit? I doubt you 
                         can even get a credit card based on 
                         that.

               A hand lays an envelope full of money on the table in front 
               of Butch. Butch picks it up.

                         Now the night of the fight, you may 
                         fell a slight sting, that's pride 
                         fuckin' wit ya.  Fuck pride! Pride 
                         only hurts, it never helps. Fight 
                         through that shit. 'Cause a year 
                         from now, when you're kickin' it in 
                         the Caribbean you're gonna say, 
                         "Marsellus Wallace was right."

                                     BUTCH
                         I got no problem with that.

                         In the fifth, your ass goes down.

               Butch nods his head: "yes."

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)
                         Say it!

                                     BUTCH
                         In the fifth, my ass goes down.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAR (MOVING)  DAY

               Vincent Vega looks really cool behind the wheel of a 1964 
               cherry red Chevy Malibu convertible. From the car radio, 
               ROCKABILLY MUSIC PLAYS. The b.g. is a COLORFUL PROCESS SHOT.

               EXT. SALLY LEROY'S  DAY

               Sally LeRoy's is a large topless bar by LAX that Marsellus 
               owns.

               Vincent's classic Malibu WHIPS into the near empty parking 
               lot and parks next to a white Honda Civic.

               Vince knocks on the door. The front entrance is unlocked, 
               revealing the Dapper Dan fellow on the inside: ENGLISH DAVE. 
               Dave isn't really English, he's a young black man from Baldwin 
               Park, who has run a few clubs for Marsellus, including Sally 
               LeRoy's.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         Vincent Vega, our man in Amsterdam, 
                         git your ass on in here.

               Vincent, carrying the black briefcase from the scene between 
               Vincent and Jules, steps inside. English Dave SLAMS the door 
               in our faces.

               INT. SALLY LEROY'S  DAY

               The spacious club is empty this time of day. English Dave 
               crosses to the bar, and Vince follows.

                                     VINCENT
                         Where's the big man?

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         He's over there, finishing up some 
                         business.

               VINCENT'S POV: Butch shakes hands with a huge figure with 
               his back to us. The huge figure is the infamous and as of 
               yet still UNSEEN Marsellus.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE (O.S.)
                         Hang back for a second or two, and 
                         when you see the white boy leave, go 
                         on over.  In the meanwhile, can I 
                         make you an espresso?

                                     VINCENT
                         How 'bout a cup of just plain lo' 
                         American?

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         Comin' up. I hear you're taking Mia 
                         out tomorrow?

                                     VINCENT
                         At Marsellus' request.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         Have you met Mia?

                                     VINCENT
                         Not yet.

               English Dave smiles to himself.

                                     VINCENT
                         What's so funny?

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         Not a goddamn thing.

                                     VINCENT
                         Look, I'm not a idiot. She's the big 
                         man's fuckin' wife. I'm gonna sit 
                         across a table, chew my food with my 
                         mouth closed, laugh at her jokes and 
                         that's all I'm gonna do.

               English Dave puts Vince's coffee in front of him.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         My name's Paul, and this is between 
                         y'all.

               Butch bellies up to the bar next to Vincent, drinking his 
               cup of "Plain ol' American."

                                     BUTCH
                              (to English Dave)
                         Can I get a pack'a Red Apples?

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         Filters?

                                     BUTCH
                         Non.

               While Butch waits for his smokes, Vincent just sips his 
               coffee, staring at him. Butch looks over at him.

                                     BUTCH
                         Lookin' at somethin', friend?

                                     VINCENT
                         I ain't your friend, palooka.

               Butch does a slow turn toward Vincent.

                                     BUTCH
                         What was that?

                                     VINCENT
                         I think ya heard me just fine, punchy.

               Butch turns his body to Vincent, when...

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)
                         Vincent Vega has entered the building, 
                         git your ass over here!

               Vincent walks forward OUT OF FRAME, never giving Butch another 
               glance. We DOLLY INTO CU on Butch, left alone in the FRAME, 
               looking like he's ready to go into the manners-teaching 
               business.

               BUTCH'S POV: Vincent hugging and kissing the obscured figure 
               that is Marsellus.

               Butch makes the wise decision that is this asshole's a friend 
               of Marsellus, he better let it go  for now.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE (O.S.)
                         Pack of Red Apples, dollar-forty.

               Butch is snapped out of his ass-kicking thoughts. He pays 
               English Dave and walks out of the SHOT.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. LANCE'S HOUSE (KITCHEN)  NIGHT

               CLOSEUP  JODY

               A woman who appears to have a fondness for earrings. Both of 
               her ears are pierced five times. She also sports rings in 
               her lips, eyebrows and nose.

                                     JODY
                         ...I'll lend it to you. It's a great 
                         book on body piercing.

               Jody, Vincent and a young woman named TRUDI sit at the kitchen 
               table of a suburban house in Echo Park. Even though Vince is 
               at the same table, he's not included in the conversation.

                                     TRUDI
                         You know how they use that gun when 
                         they pierce your ears? They don't 
                         use that when they pierce your 
                         nipples, do they?

                                     JODY
                         Forget that gun. That gun goes against 
                         the entire idea behind piercing. All 
                         of my piercing, sixteen places on my 
                         body, every one of 'em done with a 
                         needle. Five in each ear. One through 
                         the nipple on my left breast. One 
                         through my right nostril.  One through 
                         my left eyebrow. One through my lip. 
                         One in my clit. And I wear a stud in 
                         my tongue.

               Vince has been letting this conversation go through one ear 
               and out the other, until that last remark.

                                     VINCENT
                              (interrupting)
                         Excuse me, sorry to interrupt. I'm 
                         curious, why would you get a stud in 
                         your tongue?

               Jody looks at him and says as if it were the most obvious 
               thing in the world.

                                     JODY
                         It's a sex thing. It helps fellatio.

               That thought never occurred to Vincent, but he can't deny it 
               makes sense. Jody continues talking to Trudi, leaving Vincent 
               to ponder the truth of her statement.

                         Vince, you can come in now!

               INT. LANCE'S BEDROOM  NIGHT

               Lance, late 20s, is a young man with a wild and woolly 
               appearance that goes hand-in-hand with his wild and woolly 
               personality. LANCE has been selling drugs his entire adult 
               life. He's never had a day job, never filed a tax return and 
               has never been arrested. He wears a red flannel shirt over a 
               "Speed Racer" tee-shirt.

               Three bags of heroin lie on Lance's bed.

               Lance and Vincent stand at the foot of the bed.

                         Now this is Panda, from Mexico. Very 
                         good stuff. This is Bava, different, 
                         but equally good. And this is Choco 
                         from the Hartz Mountains of Germany. 
                         Now the first two are the same, forty-
                         five an ounce  those are friend 
                         prices  but this one...

                         ...this one's a little more expensive.  
                         It's fifty-five. But when you shoot 
                         it, you'll know where that extra 
                         money went.  Nothing wrong with the 
                         first two. It's real, real, real, 
                         good shit. But this one's a fuckin' 
                         madman.

               EXT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S  NIGHT

               In the past six years, 50's diners have sprung up all over 
               L.A., giving Thai restaurants a run for their money. They're 
               all basically the same. Decor out of an "Archie" comic book, 
               Golden Oldies constantly emanating from a bubbly Wurlitzer, 
               saucy waitresses in bobby socks, menus with items like the 
               Fats Domino Cheeseburger, or the Wolfman Jack Omelet, and 
               over prices that pay for all this bullshit.

               But then there's JACKRABBIT SLIM'S, the big mama of 50's 
               diners.

               Either the best or the worst, depending on your point of 
               view.

               Vincent's Malibu pulls up to the restaurant. A big sign with 
               a neon figure of a cartoon surly cool cat jackrabbit in a 
               red windbreaker towers over the establishment. Underneath 
               the cartoon is the name: JACKRABBIT SLIM'S. Underneath that 
               is the slogan: "Next best thing to a time machine."

               INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S  NIGHT

               Compared to the interior, the exterior was that of a quaint 
               English pub. Posters from 50's A.I.P. movies are all over 
               the wall

               ("ROCK ALL NIGHT," "HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL," "ATTACK OF 
               THE CRAB MONSTER," and "MACHINE GUN KELLY"). The booths that 
               the patrons sit in are made out of the cut up bodies of 50s 
               cars.

               In the middle of the restaurant in a dance floor. A big sign 
               on the wall states, "No shoes allowed." Some wannabe beboppers 
               (actually Melrose-types), do the twist in their socks or 
               barefeet.

               The picture windows don't look out the street, but instead, 
               B & W movies of 50's street scenes play behind them. The 
               WAITRESSES and WAITERS are made up as replicas of 50's icons: 
               MARILYN MONROE, ZORRO, JAMES DEAN, DONNA REED, MARTIN and 
               LEWIS, and THE PHILIP MORRIS MIDGET, wait on tables wearing 
               appropriate costumes.

               Vincent and Mia study the menu in a booth made out of a red 
               '59 Edsel. BUDDY HOLLY (their waiter), comes over, sporting 
               a big button on his chest that says: "Hi I'm Buddy, pleasing 
               you please me."

                                     BUDDY

                         Did you just order a five-dollar 
                         shake?

                                     MIA
                         Sure did.

                                     VINCENT
                         A shake? Milk and ice cream?

                                     MIA
                         Uh-huh.

                                     VINCENT
                         It costs five dollars?

                                     BUDDY
                         Yep.

                                     VINCENT
                         You don't put bourbon in it or 
                         anything?

                                     BUDDY
                         Nope.

                                     VINCENT
                         Just checking.

               Buddy exits.

               Vincent takes a look around the place. The YUPPIES are 
               dancing, the DINERS are biting into big, juicy hamburgers, 
               and the icons are playing their parts. Marilyn is squealing, 
               The Midget is paging Philip Morris, Donna Reed is making her 
               customers drink their milk, and Dean and Jerry are acting a 
               fool.

                                     MIA
                         Whaddya think?

                                     VINCENT
                         It's like a wax museum with a pulse 
                         rate.

               Vincent takes out his pouch of tobacco and begins rolling 
               himself a smoke.

               After a second of watching him 

                                     MIA
                         What are you doing?

                                     VINCENT
                         Rollin' a smoke.

                                     MIA
                         Here?

                                     VINCENT
                         It's just tobacco.

                                     MIA
                         Oh. Well in that case, will you roll 
                         me one, cowboy?

               As he finishes licking it 

                                     VINCENT
                         You can have this one, cowgirl.

               He hands her the rolled smoke. She takes it, putting it to 
               her lips. Out of nowhere appears a Zippo lighter in Vincent's 
               hand. He lights it.

                                     MIA
                         Thanks.

                                     VINCENT
                         Think nothing of it.

               He begins rolling one for himself.

               As this time, the SOUND of a subway car fills the diner, 
               making everything SHAKE and RATTLE. Marilyn Monroe runs to a 
               square vent in the floor. An imaginary subway train BLOWS 
               the skirt of her white dress around her ears as she lets out 
               a squeal. The entire restaurant applauds.

               Back to Mia and Vincent.

                                     MIA
                         Marsellus said you just got back 
                         from Amsterdam.

                                     VINCENT
                         Sure did. I heard you did a pilot.

                                     MIA
                         That was my fifteen minutes.

                                     VINCENT
                         What was it?

                                     MIA
                         It was show about a team of female 
                         secret agents called "Fox Force Five."

                                     VINCENT
                         What?

                                     MIA
                         "Fox Force Five." Fox, as in we're a 
                         bunch of foxy chicks. Force, as in 
                         we're a force to be reckoned with. 
                         Five, as in there's one... two ... 
                         three... four... five of us. There 
                         was a blonde one, Sommerset O'Neal 
                         from that show "Baton Rouge," she 
                         was the leader. A Japanese one, a 
                         black one, a French one and a brunette 
                         one, me.  We all had special skills. 
                         Sommerset had a photographic memory, 
                         the Japanese fox was a kung fu master, 
                         the black girl was a demolition 
                         expert, the French fox' specialty 
                         was sex...

                                     VINCENT
                         What was your specialty?

                                     MIA
                         Knives. The character I played, Raven 
                         McCoy, her background was she was 
                         raised by circus performers. So she 
                         grew up doing a knife act. According 
                         to the show, she was the deadliest 
                         woman in the world with a knife. But 
                         because she grew up in a circus, she 
                         was also something of an acrobat. 
                         She could do illusions, she was a 
                         trapeze artist  when you're keeping 
                         the world safe from evil, you never 
                         know when being a trapeze artist's 
                         gonna come in handy. And she knew a 
                         zillion old jokes her grandfather, 
                         an old vaudevillian, taught her. If 
                         we woulda got picked up, they woulda 
                         worked in a gimmick where every 
                         episode I woulda told and ol joke.

                                     VINCENT
                         Do you remember any of the jokes?

                                     MIA
                         Well I only got the chance to say 
                         one, 'cause we only did one show.

                                     VINCENT
                         Tell me.

                                     MIA
                         No. It's really corny.

                                     VINCENT
                         C'mon, don't be that way.

                                     MIA
                         No. You won't like it and I'll be 
                         embarrassed.

                                     VINCENT
                         You told it in front of fifty million 
                         people and you can't tell it to me? 
                         I promise I won't laugh.

                                     MIA
                              (laughing)
                         That's what I'm afraid of.

                                     VINCENT
                         That's not what I meant and you know 
                         it.

                                     MIA
                         You're quite the silver tongue devil, 
                         aren't you?

                                     VINCENT
                         I meant I wouldn't laugh at you.

                                     MIA
                         That's not what you said Vince. Well 
                         now I'm definitely not gonna tell 
                         ya, 'cause it's been built up too 
                         much.

                                     VINCENT
                         What a gyp.

               Buddy comes back with the drinks. Mia wraps her lips around 
               the straw of her shake.

                                     MIA
                         Yummy!

                                     VINCENT
                         Can I have a sip of that? I'd like 
                         to know what a five-dollar shake 
                         tastes like.

                                     MIA
                         Be my guest.

               She slides the shake over to him.

                                     MIA
                         You can use my straw, I don't have 
                         kooties.

               Vincent smiles.

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah, but maybe I do.

                                     MIA
                         Kooties I can handle.

               He takes a sip.

                                     VINCENT
                         Goddamn! That's a pretty fuckin' 
                         good milk shake.

                                     MIA
                         Told ya.

                                     VINCENT
                         I don't know if it's worth five 
                         dollars, but it's pretty fuckin' 
                         good.

               He slides the shake back.

               Then the first of an uncomfortable silence happens.

                                     MIA
                         Don't you hate that?

                                     VINCENT
                         What?

                                     MIA
                         Uncomfortable silences. Why do we 
                         feel it's necessary to yak about 
                         bullshit in order to be comfortable?

                                     VINCENT
                         I don't know.

                                     MIA
                         That's when you know you found 
                         somebody special. When you can just 
                         shit the fuck up for a minute, and 
                         comfortably share silence.

                                     VINCENT
                         I don't think we're there yet. But 
                         don't feel bad, we just met each 
                         other.

                                     MIA
                         Well I'll tell you what, I'll go to 
                         the bathroom and powder my nose, 
                         while you sit here and think of 
                         something to say.

                                     VINCENT
                         I'll do that.

               INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (LADIES ROOM)  NIGHT

               Mia powders her nose by doing a big line of coke off the 
               bathroom sink. Her head jerks up from the rush.

                                     MIA
                              (imitating Steppenwolf)
                         I said goddamn!

               INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA)  NIGHT

               Vincent digs into his Douglas Sirk steak. As he chews, his 
               eyes scan the Hellsapopinish restaurant.

               Mia comes back to the table.

                                     MIA
                         Don't you love it when you go to the 
                         bathroom and you come back to find 
                         your food waiting for you?

                                     VINCENT
                         We're lucky we got it at all. Buddy 
                         Holly doesn't seem to be much of a 
                         waiter. We shoulda sat in Marilyn 
                         Monroe's section.

                                     MIA
                         Which one, there's two Marilyn 
                         Monroes.

                                     VINCENT
                         No there's not.

               Pointing at Marilyn in the white dress serving a table.

                                     VINCENT
                         That's Marilyn Monroe...

               Then, pointing at a BLONDE WAITRESS in a tight sweater and 
               capri pants, taking an order from a bunch of FILM GEEKS 

                                     VINCENT
                         ... and that's Mamie Van Doren. I 
                         don't see Jayne Mansfield, so it 
                         must be her night off.

                                     MIA
                         Pretty smart.

                                     VINCENT
                         I have moments.

                                     MIA
                         Did ya think of something to say?

                                     VINCENT
                         Actually, there's something I've 
                         wanted to ask you about, but you 
                         seem like a nice person, and I didn't 
                         want to offend you.

                                     MIA
                         Oooohhhh, this doesn't sound like 
                         mindless, boring, getting-to-know-
                         you chit-chat. This sounds like you 
                         actually have something to say.

                                     VINCENT
                         Only if you promise not to get 
                         offended.

                                     MIA
                         You can't promise something like 
                         that. I have no idea what you're 
                         gonna ask. You could ask me what 
                         you're gonna ask me, and my natural 
                         response could be to be offended. 
                         Then, through no fault of my own, I 
                         woulda broken my promise.

                                     VINCENT
                         Then let's just forget it.

                                     MIA
                         That is an impossibility. Trying to 
                         forget anything as intriguing as 
                         this would be an exercise in futility.

                                     VINCENT
                         Is that a fact?

               Mia nods her head: "Yes."

                                     MIA
                         Besides, it's more exciting when you 
                         don't have permission.

                                     VINCENT
                         What do you think about what happened 
                         to Antwan?

                                     MIA
                         Who's Antwan?

                                     VINCENT
                         Tony Rocky Horror.

                                     MIA
                         He fell out of a window.

                                     VINCENT
                         That's one way to say it. Another 
                         way is, he was thrown out. Another 
                         was is, he was thrown out by 
                         Marsellus. And even another way is, 
                         he was thrown out of a window by 
                         Marsellus because of you.

                                     MIA
                         Is that a fact?

                                     VINCENT
                         No it's not, it's just what I heard.

                                     MIA
                         Who told you this?

                                     VINCENT
                         They.

               Mia and Vincent smile.

                                     MIA
                         They talk a lot, don't they?

                                     VINCENT
                         They certainly do.

                                     MIA
                         Well don't by shy Vincent, what 
                         exactly did they say?

               Vincent is slow to answer.

                                     MIA
                         Let me help you Bashful, did it 
                         involve the F-word?

                                     VINCENT
                         No. They just said Rocky Horror gave 
                         you a foot massage.

                                     MIA
                         And...?

                                     VINCENT
                         No and, that's it.

                                     MIA
                         You heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horror 
                         out of a four-story window because 
                         he massaged my feet?

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah.

                                     MIA
                         And you believed that?

                                     VINCENT
                         At the time I was told, it seemed 
                         reasonable.

                                     MIA
                         Marsellus throwing Tony out of a 
                         four story window for giving me a 
                         foot massage seemed reasonable?

                                     VINCENT
                         No, it seemed excessive. But that 
                         doesn't mean it didn't happen. I 
                         heard Marsellus is very protective 
                         of you.

                                     MIA
                         A husband being protective of his 
                         wife is one thing. A husband almost 
                         killing another man for touching his 
                         wife's feet is something else.

                                     VINCENT
                         But did it happen?

                                     MIA
                         The only thing Antwan ever touched 
                         of mine was my hand, when he shook 
                         it. I met Anwan once  at my wedding 
                          then never again.  The truth is, 
                         nobody knows why Marsellus tossed 
                         Tony Rocky Horror out of that window 
                         except Marsellus and Tony Rocky 
                         Horror. But when you scamps get 
                         together, you're worse than a sewing 
                         circle.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         ...One lucky couple will win this 
                         handsome trophy that Marilyn here is

               Marilyn holds the trophy.

                                     ED SULLIVAN
                         ...Now, who will be our first 
                         contestants?

               Mia holds her hand.

                                     MIA
                         Right here.

               Vincent reacts.

                                     MIA
                         I wanna dance.

                                     VINCENT
                         No, no, no no, no, no, no, no.

                                     MIA
                              (overlapping)
                         No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I do 
                         believe Marsellus, my husband, your 
                         boss, told you to take me out and do 
                         whatever I wanted, Now, I want to 
                         dance. I want to win. I want that 
                         trophy.

                                     VINCENT
                              (sighs)
                         All right.

                                     MIA
                         So, dance good.

                                     VINCENT
                         All right, you asked for it.

               Vincent and Mia walk onto the dance floor, toward Ed Sullivan.

                                     ED SULLIVAN
                              (into microphone)
                         Let's hear it for our first 
                         contestants.

               Patrons cheer.

               Vincent and Mia walk up to the microphone.

                                     ED SULLIVAN
                         Now let's meet our first contestants 
                         here this evening. Young lady, what 
                         is your name?

                                     MIA
                              (into microphone)
                         Missus Mia Wallace.

                                     ED SULLIVAN
                              (into microphone)
                         And, uh, how 'bout your fella here?

                                     MIA
                              (into microphone)
                         Vincent Vega.

                                     ED SULLIVAN
                              (into microphone)
                         All right, let's see what you can 
                         do. Take it away!

               Mia and Vincent dance to Chuck Berry's "YOU NEVER CAN TELL". 
               They make hand movements as they dance.

               INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOME  NIGHT

               The front door FLINGS open, and Mia and Vincent dance tango-
               style into the house, singing a cappella the song from the 
               previous scene. They finish their little dance, laughing.

               Then...

               The two just stand face to face looking at each other.

                                     VINCENT
                         Was than an uncomfortable silence?

                                     MIA
                         I don't know what that was.
                              (pause)
                         Music and drinks!

               Mia moves away to attend to both. Vincent hangs up his 
               overcoat on a big bronze coat rack in the alcove.

                                     VINCENT
                         I'm gonna take a piss.

                                     MIA
                         That was a little bit more information 
                         than I needed to know, but go right 
                         ahead.

               Vincent shuffles off to the john.

               Mia moves to her CD player, thumbs through a stack of CDs 
               and selects one: k.d. lang. The speakers BLAST OUT a high 
               energy country number, which Mia plays air-guitar to. She 
               dances her way around the room and finds herself by Vincent's 
               overcoat hanging on the rack. She touches its sleeve. It 
               feels good.

               Her hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch. 
               Like a little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco 
               on some rolling paper. Imitating what he did earlier, licks 
               the paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette. Maybe a 
               little too fat, but not bad for a first try. Mia thinks so 
               anyway. Her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out 
               his Zippo lighter. She SLAPS the lighter against her leg, 
               trying to light it fancy-style like Vince did. What do you 
               know, she did it! Mia's one happy clam. She triumphantly 
               brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it up, 
               then LOUDLY SNAPS the Zippo closed.

               The Mia-made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she 
               takes a long, cool drag. Her hand slides the Zippo back in 
               the overcoat pocket. But wait, her fingers touch something 
               else. Those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder 
               inside, the madman that Vincent bought earlier from Lance. 
               Wearing a big smile, Mia brings the bag of heroin up to her 
               face.

                                     MIA
                              (like you would say 
                              Bingo!)
                         Disco! Vince, you little cola nut, 
                         you've been holding out on me.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BATHROOM (MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE)  NIGHT

               Vincent stands at the sink, washing his hands, talking to 
               himself in the mirror.

                                     VINCENT
                         One drink and leave. Don't be rude, 
                         but drink your drink quickly, say 
                         goodbye, walk out the door, get in 
                         your car, and go down the road.

               LIVING ROOM

               Mia has the unbeknownst-to-her heroin cut up into big lines 
               on her glass top coffee table. Taking her trusty hundred 
               dollar bill like a human Dust-Buster, she quickly snorts the 
               fat line.

               CLOSEUP  MIA

               Her head JERKS back. Her hands go to her nose (which feels 
               like it's on fucking fire), something is terribly wrong. 
               Then... the rush hits...

               BATHROOM

               Vincent dries his hands on a towel while he continues his 
               dialogue with the mirror.

                                     VINCENT
                         ...It's a moral test of yourself, 
                         whether or not you can maintain 
                         loyalty. Because when people are 
                         loyal to each other, that's very 
                         meaningful.

               LIVING ROOM

               Mia is on all fours trying to crawl to the bathroom, but 
               it's like she's trying to crawl with the bones removed from 
               her knees. Blood begins to drip from Mia's nose. Then her 
               stomach gets into the act and she VOMITS.

               BATHROOM

               Vince continues.

                                     VINCENT
                         So you're gonna go out there, drink 
                         your drink, say "Goodnight, I've had 
                         a very lovely evening," go home, and 
                         jack off.  And that's all you're 
                         gonna do.

               Now that he's given himself a little pep talk, Vincent's 
               ready for whatever's waiting for him on the other side of 
               that door. So he goes through it.

               LIVING ROOM

               We follow behind Vincent as he walks from the bathroom to 
               the living room, where he finds Mia lying on the floor like 
               a rag doll. She's twisted on her back. Blood and puke are 
               down her front. And her face is contorted. Not out of the 
               tightness of pain, but just the opposite, the muscles in her 
               face are so relaxed, she lies still with her mouth wide open. 
               Slack-jawed.

                                     VINCENT
                         Jesus Christ!

               Vincent moves like greased lightning to Mia's fallen body. 
               Bending down where she lays, he puts his fingers on her neck 
               to check her pulse. She slightly stirs.

               Mia is aware of Vincent over her, speaking to her.

                                     VINCENT
                              (sounding weird)
                         Mia! MIA! What the hell happened?

               But she's unable to communicate Mia makes a few lost mumbles, 
               but they're not distinctive enough to be called words.

               Vincent props her eyelids open and sees the story.

                                     VINCENT
                              (to himself)
                         I'll be a son-of-a-bitch.
                              (to Mia)
                         Mia! MIA! What did you take? Answer 
                         me honey, what did you take?

               Mia is incapable of answering. He SLAPS her face hard.

               Vincent SPRINGS up and RUNS to his overcoat, hanging on the 
               rack.

               He goes through the pockets FRANTICALLY. It's gone. Vincent 
               makes a beeline to Mia. We follow.

                                     VINCENT
                              (yelling to Mia)
                         Okay honey, we're getting you on 
                         your feet.

               He reaches her and hoists the dead weight up in his arms.

                                     VINCENT
                         We're on our feet now, and now we're 
                         gonna talk out to the car. Here we 
                         go, watch us walk.

               We follow behind as he hurriedly walks the practically-
               unconscious Mia through the house and out the front door.

               EXT. VINCENT'S HOT ROD (MOVING)  NIGHT

               INSERT SPEEDOMETER: red needle on a hundred.

               Vincent driving like a madman in a town without traffic laws, 
               speeds the car into turns and up and over hills.

               INT.VINCENT'S HOT ROD (MOVING)  NIGHT

               Vincent, one hand firmly on the wheel, the other shifting 
               like Robocop, both eyes staring straight ahead except when 
               he glances over at Mia.

               Mia, slack-jawed expression, mouth gaping, posture of a bag 
               of water.

               Vincent takes a cellular phone out of his pocket. He punches 
               a number.

               INT. LANCE'S HOUSE  NIGHT

               At this late hour, LANCE has transformed from a bon vivant 
               drug dealer to a bathrobe creature.

               He sits in a big comfy chair, ratty blue gym pants, a worn-
               out but comfortable tee-shirt that has, written on it, "TAFT, 
               CALIFORNIA", and a moth-ridden terry cloth robe. In his hand 
               is a bowl of Cap'n Crunch with Crunch Berries. In front of 
               him on the coffee table is a jug of milk, the box the Cap'n 
               Crunch with Crunch Berries came out of, and a hash pipe in 
               an ashtray.

               On the big-screen TV in front of the table is the Three 
               Stooges, and they're getting married.

                                     PREACHER (EMIL SIMKUS)
                              (on TV)
                         Hold hands, you love birds.

               The phone RINGS.

               Lance puts down his cereal and makes his way to the phone.

               It RINGS again.

               Jody, his wife, CALLS from the bedroom, obviously woken up.

                                     JODY (O.S.)
                         Lance! The phone's ringing!

                                     LANCE
                              (calling back)
                         I can hear it!

                                     JODY (O.S.)
                         I thought you told those fuckin' 
                         assholes never to call this late!

                                     LANCE
                              (by the phone)
                         I told 'em and that's what I'm gonna 
                         tell this fuckin' asshole right now!
                              (he answers the phone)
                         Hello, do you know how late it is? 
                         You're not supposed to be callin' me 
                         this fuckin' late.

                                                                   BACK TO:

               VINCENT IN THE MALIBU

               Vincent is still driving like a stripe-assed ape, clutching 
               the phone to his ear. WE CUT BACK AND FORTH during the 
               conversation.

                                     VINCENT
                         Lance, this is Vincent, I'm in big 
                         fuckin' trouble man, I'm on my way 
                         to your place.

                                     LANCE
                         Whoa, hold you horses man, what's 
                         the problem?

                                     VINCENT
                         You still got an adrenaline shot?

                                     LANCE
                              (dawning on him)
                         Maybe.

                                     VINCENT
                         I need it man, I got a chick she's 
                         fuckin'  Doing on me.

                                     LANCE
                         Don't bring her here!  I'm not even 
                         fuckin' joking with you, don't you 
                         be bringing some fucked up pooh-butt 
                         to my house!

                                     VINCENT
                         No choice.

                                     LANCE
                         She's ODin'?

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah. She's dyin'.

                                     LANCE
                         Then bite the fuckin' bullet, take 
                         'er to a hospital and call a lawyer!

                                     VINCENT
                         Negative.

                                     LANCE
                         She ain't my fuckin' problem, you 
                         fucked her up, you deal with it  
                         are you talkin' to me on a cellular 
                         phone?

                                     VINCENT
                         Sorry.

                                     LANCE
                         I don't know you, who is this, don't 
                         come here, I'm hangin' up.

                                     VINCENT
                         Too late, I'm already here.

               At that moment inside Lance's house, WE HEAR VINCENT's Malibu 
               coming up the street. Lance hangs up the phone, goes to his 
               curtains and YANKS the cord. The curtains open with a WHOOSH 
               in time to see Vincent's Malibu DRIVING UP on his front lawn 
               and CRASHING into his house. The window Lance is looking out 
               of SHATTERS from the impact.

                                     JODY (O.S.)
                         What the hell was that?

               Lance CHARGES from the window, out the door to his front 
               lawn.

               EXT. LANCE'S HOUSE  NIGHT

               Vincent is already out of the car, working on getting Mia 
               out.

                                     LANCE
                         Have you lost your mind?! You crashed

                         hissy fit, this chick is dyin', get

                         that fucked up bitch in my house!

                                     VINCENT
                         This fucked up bitch is Marsellus 
                         Wallace's wife. Now if she fuckin' 
                         croaks on me, I'm a grease spot. But 
                         before he turns me into a bar soap, 
                         I'm gonna be forced to tell 'im about 
                         how you coulda saved her life, but 
                         instead you let her die on your front 
                         lawn.

               INT. LANCE'S HOUSE  NIGHT

               WE START in Lance's and Jody's bedroom.

               Jody, in bed, throws off the covers and stands up. She's 
               wearing a long tee-shirt with a picture of Fred Flintstone 
               on it.

               We follow HANDHELD behind her as she opens the door, walking 
               through the hall into the living room.

                                     JODY
                         It's only one-thirty in the goddamn 
                         mornin'! What the fuck's goin' on 
                         out here?

               As she walks in the living room, she sees Vincent and Lance 
               standing over Mia, who's lying on the floor in the middle of 
               the room.

               From here on in, everything in this scene is frantic, like a 
               DOCUMENTARY in an emergency ward, with the big difference 
               here being nobody knows what the fuck they're doing.

                                     JODY
                         Who's she?

               Lance looks up at Jody.

                                     LANCE
                         Get that black box in the bedroom I 
                         have with the adrenaline shot.

                                     JODY
                         What's wrong with her?

                                     VINCENT
                         She's ODing on us.

                                     JODY
                         Well get her the hell outta here!

                                     LANCE AND VINCENT
                              (in stereo)
                         Get the fuckin' shot!

                         Don't yell and me!

               She angrily turns and disappears into the bedroom looking 
               for the shot.

               WE MOVE into the room with the two men.

                                     VINCENT
                              (to Lance)

                         get a medical book.

                                     VINCENT
                         What do you need a medical book for?

               WE FOLLOW Lance as he runs out of the living room into a...

               INT. SPARE ROOM

               With a bunch of junk in it. He frantically starts scanning 
               the junk for the book he's looking for, repeating the words, 
               "Come on," endlessly.

               From OFF SCREEN we hear:

                                     VINCENT (O.S.)
                         Hurry up man! We're losin' her!

                         I'm looking as fast as I can!

               Lance continues his frenzied search.

               WE HEAR Jody in the living room now as she talks to Vincent.

                                     JODY (O.S.)
                         What's he lookin' for?

                                     VINCENT (O.S.)
                         I dunno, some medical book.

               Jody calls to LANCE.

                                     JODY (O.S.)
                         What are you lookin' for?

               As he continues searching, flipping and knocking over shit, 
               Jody appears in the doorway.

                                     JODY

                         Well if it's that important, why 
                         didn't you keep it with the shot?

               Lance spins toward her.

                                     LANCE
                         I don't know! Stop bothering me!

                         While you're lookin' for it, that 
                         girl's gonna die on our carpet. You're 
                         never gonna find it in all this shit.  
                         For six months now, I've been telling 
                         you to clean this room 

                                     VINCENT (O.S.)
                          get your ass in here, fuck the 
                         book!

               Lance angrily knocks over a pile of shit and leaves the SHOT 
               heading for the living room.

               LIVING ROOM

               Vincent is bent over Mia, talking softly to her, when Lance 
               reenters the room.

                                     VINCENT
                         Quit fuckin' around man and give her 
                         the shot!

               Lance bends down by the black case brought in by Jody. He 
               opens it and begins preparing the needle for injection.

                                     LANCE
                         While I'm doing this, take her shirt 
                         off and find her heart.

               Vince rips her blouse open.

               Jody stumbles back in the room, hanging back from the action.

                                     VINCENT
                         Does it have to be exact?

                                     LANCE
                         Yeah, it has to be exact! I'm giving 
                         her an injection in the heart, so I 
                         gotta exactly hit her in the heart.

                                     VINCENT
                         Well, I don't know exactly where her 
                         heart is, I think it's here.

               Vince points to Mia's right breast.  Lance glances over and 
               nods.

                                     LANCE
                         That's it.

               As Lance readies the injection, Vincent looks up at Jody.

                                     VINCENT
                         I need a big fat magic marker, got 
                         one?

                                     JODY
                         What?

                                     VINCENT
                         I need a big fat magic marker, any 
                         felt pen'll do, but a magic marker 
                         would be great.

                                     JODY
                         Hold on.

               Jody runs to the desk, opens the top drawer and, in her 
               enthusiasm, she pulls the drawer out of the desk, the contents 
               of which (bills, papers, pens) spill to the floor.

               The injection is ready. Lance hands Vincent the needle.

                                     LANCE
                         It's ready, I'll tell you what to

                         You're gonna give her the shot.

                         I've never does this before.

                         I've never done this before either, 
                         and I ain't starting now. You brought 
                         'er here, that means you give her 
                         the shot. The day I bring an ODing 
                         bitch to your place, then I gotta 
                         give her the shot.

               Jody hurriedly joins them in the huddle, a big fat red magic 
               marker in her hand.

                                     JODY
                         Got it.

               Vincent grabs the magic marker out of Jody's hand and makes 
               a big red dot on Mia's body where her heart is.

                                     VINCENT
                         Okay, what do I do?

                                     LANCE
                         Well, you're giving her an injection 
                         of adrenaline straight to her heart. 
                         But she's got a breast plate in front 
                         of her heart, so you gotta pierce 
                         through that. So what you gotta do 
                         is bring the needle down in a stabbing 
                         motion.

               Lance demonstrates a stabbing motion, which looks like "The 
               Shape" killing its victims in "HALLOWEEN".

                                     VINCENT
                         I gotta stab her?

                                     LANCE
                         If you want the needle to pierce 
                         through to her heart, you gotta stab 
                         her hard.

               Then once you do, push down on the plunger.

                                     VINCENT
                         What happens after that?

                         I'm curious about that myself.

                                     VINCENT
                         This ain't a fuckin' joke man!

                              (snaps his fingers)
                          that.

               Vincent lifts the needle up above his head in a stabbing 
               motion.

               He looks down on Mia.

               Mia is fading fast. Soon nothing will help her.

               Vincent's eyes narrow, ready to do this.

                                     VINCENT
                         Count to three.

               Lance, on this knees right beside Vincent, does not know 
               what to expect.

               NEEDLE in that air, poised like a rattler ready to strike.

                         ...three!

               The needle leaves frame, THRUSTING down hard.

               Vincent brings the needle down hard, STABBING Mia in the 
               chest.

               Mia's head is JOLTED from the impact.

               The syringe plunger is pushed down, PUMPING the adrenaline 
               out through the needle.

               Mia's eyes POP WIDE OPEN and she lets out a HELLISH cry of 
               the banshee. She BOLTS UP in a sitting position, needle stuck 
               in her chest  SCREAMING.

               Vincent, Lance and Jody, who were in sitting positions in 
               front of Mia, JUMP BACK, scared to death.

               Mia's scream runs out. She slowly starts taking breaths of 
               air.

               The other three, now scooted halfway across the room, shaken 
               to their bones, look to see if she's alright.

                         If you're okay, say something.

               Mia, still breathing, not looking up at them, says in a 
               relatively normal voice.

                                     MIA
                         Something.

               Vincent and Lance collapse on their backs, exhausted and 
               shaking from how close to death Mia came.

               INT. VINCENT'S MALIBU (MOVING)  NIGHT

               Vincent is behind the wheel driving Mia home. No one says 
               anything, both are still too shaken.

               EXT. FRONT OF MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE  NIGHT

               The Malibu pulls up to the front. Mia gets out without saying 
               a word (still in a daze) and begins walking down the walkway 
               toward her front door.

                                     VINCENT (O.S.)
                         Mia!

               She turns around.

               Vincent's out of the car, standing on the walkway, a big 
               distance between the two.

                                     VINCENT
                         What are your thoughts on how to 
                         handle this?

                         Well I'm of the opinion that Marsellus 
                         can live his whole live and never 
                         ever hear of this incident.

               Mia smiles.

                         Don't worry about it. If Marsellus 
                         ever heard of this, I'd be in as 
                         much trouble as you.

                         I seriously doubt that.

                         Let's shake on it.

               The two walk toward each other, holding out their hands to 
               shake and shake they do.

                         Mum's the word.

               Mia lets go of Vincent's hand and silently makes the see-no-
               evil, hear-no-evil, and speak-no-evil sign with her hands.

               Vincent smiles.

                         If you'll excuse me, I gotta go home 
                         and have a heart attack.

               Mia giggles.

               Vincent turns to leave.

                         You still wanna hear my "FOX FORCE

               Vincent turns around.

                                     VINCENT
                         Sure, but I think I'm still a little 
                         too petrified to laugh.

                         Uh-huh. You won't laugh because it's 
                         not funny. But if you still wanna 
                         hear it, I'll tell it.

                                     VINCENT

                         The baby tomato is lagging behind

               BUTCH'S POV

               We're in the living room of a modest two bedroom house in 
               Alhambra, California, in the year 1972. BUTCH'S MOTHER, 35ish, 
               stands in the doorway leading into the living room. Next to 
               her is a man dressed in the uniform of an American Air Force 
               officer. The CAMERA is the perspective of a five-year old 
               boy.

                                     MOTHER
                         Butch, stop watching TV a second. We 
                         got a special visitor. Now do you 
                         remember when I told you your daddy 
                         dies in a P.O.W. camp?

                                     BUTCH (O.S.)
                         Uh-huh.

                                     MOTHER
                         Well this here is Capt. Koons. He 
                         was in the P.O.W. camp with Daddy.

               CAPT. KOONS steps inside the room toward the little boy and 
               bends down on one knee to bring him even with the boy's 
               eyeline. When Koons speaks, he speaks with a slight Texas 
               accent.

                                     CAPT. KOONS
                         Hello, little man. Boy I sure heard 
                         a bunch about you. See, I was a good 
                         friend of your Daddy's. We were in 
                         that Hanoi pit of hell over five 
                         years together.  Hopefully, you'll 
                         never have to experience this 
                         yourself, but when two men are in a 
                         situation like me and your Daddy 
                         were, for as long as we were, you 
                         take on certain responsibilities of 
                         the other. If it had been me who had 
                         not made it, Major Coolidge would be 
                         talkin' right now to my son Jim. But 
                         the way it worked out is I'm talkin' 
                         to you, Butch. I got somethin' for 
                         ya.

               The Captain pulls a gold wrist watch out of his pocket.

                                     CAPT. KOONS
                         This watch I got here was first 
                         purchased by your great-granddaddy. 
                         It was bought during the First World 
                         War in a little general store in 
                         Knoxville, Tennessee. It was bought 
                         by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge 
                         the day he set sail for Paris. It 
                         was your great-granddaddy's war watch, 
                         made by the first company to ever 
                         make wrist watches. You see, up until 
                         then, people just carried pocket 
                         watches. Your great-granddaddy wore 
                         that watch every day he was in the 
                         war. Then when he had done his duty, 
                         he went home to your great-
                         grandmother, took the watch off his 
                         wrist and put it in an ol' coffee 
                         can. And in that can it stayed 'til 
                         your grandfather Dane Coolidge was 
                         called upon by his country to go 
                         overseas and fight the Germans once 
                         again. This time they called it World 
                         War Two. Your great-granddaddy gave 
                         it to your granddad for good luck.  
                         Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as 
                         good as his old man's. Your granddad 
                         was a Marine and he was killed with 
                         all the other Marines at the battle 
                         of Wake Island. Your granddad was 
                         facing death and he knew it. None of 
                         those boys had any illusions about 
                         ever leavin' that island alive. So 
                         three days before the Japanese took 
                         the island, your 22-year old 
                         grandfather asked a gunner on an Air 
                         Force transport named Winocki, a man 
                         he had never met before in his life, 
                         to deliver to his infant son, who he 
                         had never seen in the flesh, his 
                         gold watch. Three days later, your 
                         grandfather was dead. But Winocki 
                         kept his word. After the war was 
                         over, he paid a visit to your 
                         grandmother, delivering to your infant 
                         father, his Dad's gold watch. This 
                         watch. This watch was on your Daddy's 
                         wrist when he was shot down over 
                         Hanoi. He was captured and put in a 
                         Vietnamese prison camp. Now he knew 
                         if the gooks ever saw the watch it'd 
                         be confiscated. The way your Daddy 
                         looked at it, that watch was your 
                         birthright. And he'd be damned if 
                         and slopeheads were gonna put their 
                         greasy yella hands on his boy's 
                         birthright. So he hid it in the one 
                         place he knew he could hide somethin'. 
                         His ass. Five long years, he wore 
                         this watch up his ass. Then when he 
                         died of dysentery, he gave me the 
                         watch. I hid with uncomfortable hunk 
                         of metal up my ass for two years. 
                         Then, after seven years, I was sent 
                         home to my family. And now, little 
                         man, I give the watch to you.

               Capt. Koons hands the watch to Butch. A little hand comes 
               into FRAME to accept it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LOCKER ROOM  NIGHT

               The 27-year old Butch Coolidge is dressed in boxing regalia: 
               trunks, shoes and gloves. He lies on a table catching a few 
               zzzzzz's before his big fight. Almost as soon as WE CUT to 
               him, he wakes up with a start. Shaken by the bizarre memory, 
               he wipes his sweaty face with his boxing glove.

               His trainer KLONDIKE, an older fireplug, opens the door a 
               little, sticking his head in the room. Pandemonium seems to 
               be breaking out behind Klondike in the hallway.

                                     KLONDIKE
                         It's time, Butch.

                                     BUTCH
                         I'm ready.

               Klondike steps inside, closing the door on the WILD MOB 
               outside.

               He goes to the long yellow robe hanging on a hook. Butch 
               hops off the table and, without a word, Klondike helps him 
               on with the robe, which says on the back: "BATTLING BUTCH 
               COOLIDGE".

               The two men head for the door. Klondike opens the door for 
               Butch.

               As Butch steps into the hallway, the Crowd goes apeshit. 
               Klondike closes the door behind him, leaving us in the quiet, 
               empty locker room.

                         ...Coolidge was out of there faster 
                         than I've ever seen a victorious 
                         boxer vacate the ring. Do you think 
                         he knew Willis was dead?

                         My guess would be yes, Richard. I 
                         could see from my position here, the 
                         frenzy in his eyes give way to the 
                         realization of what he was doing. I 
                         think any man would've left the ring 
                         that fast.

               CLICK  Esmarelda shuts off the radio.

               She takes a sip of coffee, then hears a NOISE behind her in 
               the alley. She sticks her head out of the car door to see:

               EXT. BOXING AUDITORIUM (RAINING)  NIGHT

               A window about three stories high opens on the auditorium-
               side of the alley. A gym bag is tossed out into a garbage 
               dumpster below the window. Then, Butch Coolidge, still dressed 
               in boxing trunks, shoes, gloves and yellow robe, LEAPS to 
               the dumpster below.

               ESMARELDA'S REACTION takes in the strangeness of this sight.

               Gym bag in hand, Butch CLIMBS out of the dumpster and RUNS 
               to the taxi. Before he climbs in, he takes off his robe and 
               throws it to the ground.

               INT. TAXI (PARKED / RAINING)  NIGHT

               Butch, soaking wet, naked except for trunks, shoes and gloves, 
               HOPS in the backseat, SLAMMING the door.

               Esmarelda, staring straight ahead, talks to Butch through 
               the rearview mirror:

                                     ESMARELDA
                              (Spanish accent)
                         Are you the man I was supposed to 
                         pick up?

                                     BUTCH
                         If you're the cab I called, I'm the 
                         guy you're supposed to pick up.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         Where to?

                                     BUTCH
                         Outta here.

               The ignition key is TWISTED. The engine ROARS to life.

               The meter is FLIPPED on.

               Esmarelda's bare foot STOMPS on the gas pedal.

               EXT. BOXING AUDITORIUM (RAINING)  NIGHT

               The cab WHIPS out of the alley, FISH-TAILING on the wet 
               pavement in front of the auditorium at a rapid pace.

               INT. WILLIS LOCKER ROOM (AUDITORIUM)  NIGHT

               Locker room door opens, English Dave fights his way through 
               the pandemonium which is going on outside in the hall, 
               shutting the door on the madness. Once inside, English Dave 
               takes time to adjust his suit and tie. Mia is standing by 
               the door. She sees Vincent with English Dave.

                                     VINCENT
                         Mia. How you doin'?

                                     MIA
                         Great. I never thanked you for the 
                         dinner.

               In the room, black boxer FLOYD RAY WILLIS lies on a table  
               dead.

               His face looks like he went dunking for bees. His TRAINER is 
               on his knees, head on Floyd's chest, crying over the body.

               The huge figure that is Marsellus Wallace stands at the table, 
               hand on the Trainer's shoulder, lending emotional support. 
               We still do not see Marsellus clearly, only that he is big.

               Mia sits in a chair at the far end of the room.

               Marsellus looks up, sees English Dave and walks over to him.

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)
                         What'cha got?

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         He booked.

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)
                         I'm prepared to scour the earth for 
                         this motherfucker. If Butch goes to 
                         Indo China, I want a nigger hidin' 
                         in a bowl of rice, ready to pop a 
                         cap in his ass.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         I'll take care of it.

               INT. CAB (MOVING / RAINING)  NIGHT

               Butch gets one of his boxing gloves off.

               Esmeralda watches in the rearview mirror.

               He tries to roll down one of the backseat windows, but can't 
               find the roll bar.

                                     BUTCH
                         Hey, how do I open the window back 
                         here?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         I have to do it.

               She presses a button and the back window moves down. Butch 
               tosses his boxing glove out the window, then starts untying 
               the other one.

               Esmeralda can't keep quiet anymore.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         Hey, mister?

                                     BUTCH
                              (still working on the 
                              glove)
                         What?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         You were in that fight? The fight on 
                         the radio  you're the fighter?

               As he tosses his other glove out the window.

                                     BUTCH
                         Whatever gave you that idea?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         No c'mon, you're him, I know you're 
                         him, tell me you're him.

                                     BUTCH
                              (drying himself with 
                              a gym towel)
                         I'm him.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         You killed the other boxing man.

                                     BUTCH
                         He's dead?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         The radio said he was dead.

               He finished wiping himself down.

                                     BUTCH
                              (to himself)
                         Sorry 'bout that, Floyd.

               He tosses the towel out the window.

               Silence, as Butch digs in his bag for a t-shirt.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         What does it feel like?

                                     BUTCH
                              (finds his shirt)
                         What does what feel like?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         Killing a man. Beating another man 
                         to death with your bare hands.

               Butch pulls on his tee-shirt.

                                     BUTCH
                         Are you some kinda weirdo?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         No, it's a subject I have much 
                         interest in. You are the first person 
                         I ever met who has killed somebody. 
                         So, what was it like to kill a man?

                                     BUTCH
                         Tell ya what, you give me one of 
                         them cigarettes, I'll give you an 
                         answer.

               Esmarelda bounces in her seat with excitement.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         Deal!

               Butch leans forward. Esmarelda, keeping her eyes on the road, 
               passes a cigarette back to him. He takes it. Then, still not 
               looking behind her, she brings up her hand, a lit match in 
               it.

               Butch lights his smoke, then blows out the match.

               He takes a long drag.

                                     BUTCH
                         So...

               He looks at her license.

                                     BUTCH
                         ...Esmarelda Villalobos  is that 
                         Mexican?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         The name is Spanish, but I'm 
                         Columbian.

                                     BUTCH
                         It's a very pretty name.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         It mean "Esmarelda of the wolves."

                                     BUTCH
                         That's one hell of a name you got 
                         there, sister.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         Thank you. And what is your name?

                                     BUTCH
                         Butch.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         Butch. What does it mean?

                                     BUTCH
                         I'm an American, our names don't 
                         mean shit. Anyway, moving right along, 
                         what is it you wanna know, Esmarelda?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         I want to know what it feels like to 
                         kill a man 

                                     BUTCH
                          I couldn't tell ya. I didn't know 
                         he was dead 'til you told me he was 
                         dead. Now I know he's dead, do you 
                         wanna know how I feel about it?

               Esmarelda nods her head: "yes."

                                     BUTCH
                         I don't feel the least little bit 
                         bad.

               EXT. PHONE BOOTH (RAINING)  NIGHT

               We DOLLY around a phone booth as Butch talks inside.

                                     BUTCH
                              (into phone)
                         What'd I tell ya, soon as the word 
                         got out a fix was in, the odds would 
                         be outta control. Hey, if he was a 
                         better fighter he's be alive. If he 
                         never laced up his gloves in the 
                         first place, which he never shoulda 
                         done, he'd be alive. Enough about 
                         the poor unfortunate Mr. Floyd, let's 
                         talk about the rich and prosperous 
                         Mr. Butch.  How many bookies you 
                         spread it around with?

                                     (PAUSE)
                         Eight? How long to collect?
                              (pause)
                         So by tomorrow evening, you'll have 
                         it all?
                              (pause)
                         Good news Scotty, real good news  I 
                         understand a few stragglers aside. 
                         Me an'  Fabienne're gonna leave in 
                         the morning. It should take us a 
                         couple days to get into Knoxville. 
                         Next time we see each other, it'll 
                         be on Tennessee time.

               Butch hangs up the phone. He looks at the cab waiting to 
               take him wherever he wants to go.

                                     BUTCH
                              (to himself in French 
                              with English subtitles)
                         Fabienne my love, our adventure 
                         begins.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MOTEL (STOPPED / RAINING)  NIGHT

               Esmeralda's taxi pulled into the motel parking lot. The rain 
               has stopped, but the night is still soaked. Butch gets out, 
               now fully dressed in tee-shirt, jeans and high school athletic 
               jacket. He leans in the driver's side window.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         Forty-five sixty.

               Handing her the money.

                                     BUTCH
                         Merci beaucoup. And here's a little 
                         something for the effort.

               Butch holds up a hundred dollar bill.

               Esmarelda's eyes light up. She goes to take it. Butch holds 
               it out of reach.

                                     BUTCH
                         Now if anybody should ask you about 
                         who your fare was tonight, what're 
                         you gonna tell 'em?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         The truth. Three well-dressed, 
                         slightly toasted, Mexicans.

               He gives her the bill.

                                     BUTCH
                         Bon soir, Esmarelda.

                                     ESMARELDA
                              (in Spanish)
                         Sleep well, Butch.

               He tweaks her nose, she smiles, and he turns and walks away. 
               She drives off.

               INT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX)  NIGHT

               Butch enters and turns on the light.

               Lying curled up on the bed, fully dressed, with her back to 
               us is Butch's French girlfriend, FABIENNE.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Keep the light off.

               Butch flicks the switch back, making the room dark again.

                                     BUTCH
                         Is that better, sugar pop?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Oui. Hard day at the office?

                                     BUTCH
                         Pretty hard. I got into a fight.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Poor baby. Can we make spoons?

               Butch climbs into bed, spooning Fabienne from behind.

               When Butch and Fabienne speak to each other, they speak in 
               babytalk.

                                     FABIENNE
                         I was looking at myself in the mirror.

                                     BUTCH
                         Uh-huh?

                                     FABIENNE
                         I wish I had a pot.

                                     BUTCH
                         You were lookin' in the mirror and 
                         you wish you had some pot?

                                     FABIENNE
                         A pot. A pot belly. Pot bellies are 
                         sexy.

                                     BUTCH
                         Well you should be happy, 'cause you 
                         do.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Shut up, Fatso! I don't have a pot! 
                         I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna 
                         when she did "Lucky Star," it's not 
                         the same thing.

                                     BUTCH
                         I didn't realize there was a 
                         difference between a tummy and a pot 
                         belly.

                                     FABIENNE
                         The difference is huge.

                                     BUTCH
                         You want me to have a pot?

                                     FABIENNE
                         No. Pot bellies make a man look either 
                         oafish, or like a gorilla. But on a 
                         woman, a pot belly is very sexy. The 
                         rest of you is normal. Normal face, 
                         normal legs, normal hips, normal 
                         ass, but with a big, perfectly round 
                         pot belly. If I had one, I'd wear a 
                         tee-shirt two sizes too small to 
                         accentuate it.

                                     BUTCH
                         You think guys would find that 
                         attractive?

                                     FABIENNE
                         I don't give a damn what men find 
                         attractive. It's unfortunate what we 
                         find pleasing to the touch and 
                         pleasing to the eye is seldom the 
                         same.

                                     BUTCH
                         If you a pot belly, I'd punch you in 
                         it.

                                     FABIENNE
                         You'd punch me in my belly?

                                     BUTCH
                         Right in the belly.

                                     FABIENNE
                         I'd smother you. I'd drop it on your 
                         right on your face 'til you couldn't 
                         breathe.

                                     BUTCH
                         You'd do that to me?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Yes!

                                     BUTCH
                         Did you get everything, sugar pop?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Yes, I did.

                                     BUTCH
                         Good job.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Did everything go as planned?

                                     BUTCH
                         You didn't listen to the radio?

                                     FABIENNE
                         I never listen to your fights. Were 
                         you the winner?

                                     BUTCH
                         I won alright.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Are you still retiring?

                                     BUTCH
                         Sure am.

                                     FABIENNE
                         What about the man you fought?

                                     BUTCH
                         Floyd retired too.

                                     FABIENNE
                              (smiling)
                         Really?! He won't be fighting no 
                         more?!

                                     BUTCH
                         Not no more.

                                     FABIENNE
                         So it all worked out in the finish?

                                     BUTCH
                         We ain't at the finish, baby.

               Fabienne rolls over and Butch gets on top of her. They kiss.

                                     FABIENNE
                         We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?

               Butch nods his head: "yes."

                                     FABIENNE
                         If they find us, they'll kill us, 
                         won't they?

               Butch nods his head: "yes."

                                     FABIENNE
                         But they won't find us, will they?

               Butch nods his head: "no."

                                     FABIENNE
                         Do you still want me to go with you?

               Butch nods his head: "yes."

                                     FABIENNE
                         I don't want to be a burden or a 
                         nuisance -

               Butch's hand goes out of frame and starts massaging her 
               crotch.

               Fabienne reacts.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Say it!

                                     BUTCH
                         Fabienne, I want you to be with me.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Forever?

                                     BUTCH
                         ...and ever.

               Fabienne lies her head back.

               Butch continues to massage her crotch.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Do you love me?

                                     BUTCH
                         Oui.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Butch? Will you give me oral pleasure?

               Butch kisses her on the mouth.

                                     BUTCH
                         Will you kiss it?

               She nods her head: "yes."

                                     FABIENNE
                         But you first.

               Butch's head goes down out of frame to carry out the oral 
               pleasure. Fabienne's face is alone in the frame.

                                     FABIENNE
                              (in French, with 
                              English subtitles)
                         Butch my love, the adventure begins.

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

               FADE UP:

               MOTEL ROOM

               Same motel room, except empty. WE HEAR THE SHOWER RUNNING in 
               the bathroom. The CAMERA MOVES to the bathroom doorway. We 
               see Fabienne in a white terry cloth robe that seems to swallow 
               her up.

               She's drying her head with a towel. Butch is inside the shower 
               washing up. We see the outline of his naked body through the 
               smoky glass of the shower door. Steam fills the bathroom. 
               Butch turns the shower off and opens the door, popping his 
               head out.

                                     BUTCH
                         I think I cracked a rib.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Giving me oral pleasure?

                                     BUTCH
                         No retard, from the fight.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Don't call me retard.

                                     BUTCH
                              (in a Mongoloid voice)
                         My name is Fabby! My name is Fabby!

                                     FABIENNE
                         Shut up fuck head! I hate that 
                         Mongoloid voice.

                                     BUTCH
                         Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, I take it 
                         back!  Can I have a towel please, 
                         Miss Beautiful Tulip.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Oh I like that, I like being called 
                         a tulip. Tulip is much better than 
                         Mongoloid.

               She finishes drying her hair and wraps the towel like a turban 
               on her head.

                                     BUTCH
                         I didn't call you a Mongoloid, I 
                         called you a retard, but I took it 
                         back.

               She hands him a towel.

                                     BUTCH
                         Merci beaucoup.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Butch?

                                     BUTCH
                              (drying his head)
                         Yes, lemon pie.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Where are we going to go?

                                     BUTCH
                         I'm not sure yet. Wherever you want. 
                         We're gonna get a lot of money from 
                         this. But it ain't gonna be so much, 
                         we can live like hogs in the fat 
                         house forever. I was thinking we 
                         could go somewhere in the South 
                         Pacific. The kinda money we'll have'll 
                         carry us a long way down there.

                                     FABIENNE
                         So if we wanted, we could live in 
                         Bora Bora?

                                     BUTCH
                         You betcha. And if after awhile you 
                         don't dig Bora Bora, then we can 
                         move over to Tahiti or Mexico.

                                     FABIENNE
                         But I do not speak Spanish.

                                     BUTCH
                         You don't speak Bora Boran either.
                         Besides, Mexican is easy: Donde esta 
                         el zapataria?

                                     FABIENNE
                         What does that mean?

                                     BUTCH
                         Where's the shoe store?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Donde esta el zapataria?

                                     BUTCH
                         Excellent pronunciation. You'll be 
                         my little mama ceta in no time.

               Butch exits the bathroom. We stay on Fabienne as she brushes 
               her teeth.

               Butch keeps on from the other room.

                                     BUTCH (O.S.)
                         Que hora es?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Que hora es?

                                     BUTCH (O.S.)
                         What time is it?

                                     FABIENNE
                         What time is it?

                                     BUTCH (O.S.)
                         Time for bed. Sweet dream, jellybean.

               Fabienne brushes her teeth. We watch her for a moment or 
               two, then she remember something.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Butch.

               She walks out of the bathroom to ask Butch a question, only 
               to find him sound asleep in bed.

               She looks at him for a moment.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Forget it.

               She exits frame, going back in the bathroom. WE STAY on the 
               WIDE SHOT of the unconscious Butch in bed.

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

               FADE UP:

               MOTEL ROOM  MORNING

               SAME SHOT AS BEFORE, the next morning. We find Butch still 
               asleep in bed.

               Fabienne brushes her teeth half in and half out of the 
               bathroom so she can watch TV at the same time. She still 
               wears the terry cloth robe from the night before.

               ON TV: WILLIAM SMITH and a BUNCH OF HELL'S ANGELS are taking 
               on the entire Vietnamese army in the film "THE LOSERS".

               Butch wakes from his sleep, as if a scary monster was chasing 
               him.

               His start startles Fabienne.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Merde! You startled me. Did you have 
                         a bad dream?

               Butch squints down the front of the bed at her, trying to 
               focus.

               Butch, still trying to chase the cobwebs away, sees on TV 
               Hell's Angels tear-assin' through a Vietnamese prison camp.

                                     BUTCH
                         What are you watching?

                                     FABIENNE
                         A motorcycle movie, I'm not sure the 
                         name.

                                     BUTCH
                         Are you watchin' it?

               Fabienne enters the room.

                                     FABIENNE
                         In a way. Why? Would you like for me 
                         to switch it off?

                                     BUTCH
                         Would you please?

               She reaches over and turns off the TV.

                                     BUTCH
                         It's a little too early in the morning 
                         for explosions and war.

                                     FABIENNE
                         What was it about?

                                     BUTCH
                         How should I know, you were the one 
                         watchin' it.

               Fabienne laughs.

                                     FABIENNE
                         No, imbecile, what was your dream 
                         about?

                                     BUTCH
                         Oh, I... don't remember. It's really 
                         rare I remember a dream.

                                     FABIENNE
                         You just woke up from it.

                                     BUTCH
                         Fabienne, I'm not lying to you, I 
                         don't remember.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Well, let's look at the grumpy man 
                         in the morning. I didn't say you 
                         were lying, it's just odd you don't 
                         remember your dreams. I always 
                         remember mine. Did you know you talk 
                         in your sleep?

                                     BUTCH
                         I don't talk in my sleep, do I talk 
                         in my sleep?

                                     FABIENNE
                         You did last night.

                                     BUTCH
                         What did I say?

               Laying on top of him.

                                     FABIENNE
                         I don't know. I couldn't understand 
                         you.

               She kisses Butch.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Why don't you get up and we'll get 
                         some breakfast at that breakfast 
                         place with the pancakes.

                                     BUTCH
                         One more kiss and I'll get up.

               Fabienne gives Butch a sweet long kiss.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Satisfied?

                                     BUTCH
                         Yep.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Then get up, lazy bones.

               Butch climbs out of bed and starts pulling clothes out of 
               the suitcase that Fabienne brought.

                                     BUTCH
                         What time is it?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Almost nine in the morning. What 
                         time does our train arrive?

                                     BUTCH
                         Eleven.

                                     FABIENNE
                         I'm gonna order a big plate of 
                         blueberry pancakes with maple syrup, 
                         eggs over easy, and five sausages.

                                     BUTCH
                              (surprised at her 
                              potential appetite)
                         Anything to drink with that?

               Butch is finished dressing.

                                     FABIENNE
                              (referring to his 
                              clothes)
                         Oh yes, that looks nice. To drink, a 
                         tall glass or orange juice and a 
                         black cup of coffee. After that, I'm 
                         going to have a slice of pie.

               As he goes through the suitcase.

                                     BUTCH
                         Pie for breakfast?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Any time of the day is a good time 
                         for pie. Blueberry pie to go with 
                         the pancakes. And on top, a thin 
                         slice of melted cheese 

                                     BUTCH
                          where's my watch?

                                     FABIENNE
                         It's there.

                                     BUTCH
                         No, it's not. It's not here.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Have you looked?

               By now, Butch is frantically rummaging through the suitcase.

                                     BUTCH
                         Yes I've fuckin' looked!!

               He's now throwing clothes.

                                     BUTCH
                         What the fuck do you think I'm doing?! 
                         Are you sure you got it?

               Fabienne can hardly speak, she's never seen Butch this way.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Uhhh... yes... beside the table drawer 
                         

                                     BUTCH
                          on the little kangaroo.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Yes, it was on your little kangaroo.

                                     BUTCH
                         Well it's not here!

                                     FABIENNE
                              (on the verge of tears)
                         Well it should be!

                                     BUTCH
                         Oh it most definitely should be here, 
                         but it's not. So where is it?

               Fabienne is crying and scared.

               Butch lowers his voice, which only serves to make him more 
               menacing.

                                     BUTCH
                         Fabienne, that was my father's fuckin' 
                         watch. You know what my father went 
                         through to git me that watch?... I 
                         don't wanna get into it right now... 
                         but he went through a lot. Now all 
                         this other shit, you coulda set on 
                         fire, but I specifically reminded 
                         you not to forget my father's watch. 
                         Now think, did you get it?

                                     FABIENNE
                         I believe so...

                                     BUTCH
                         You believe so? You either did, or 
                         you didn't, now which one is it?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Then I did.

                                     BUTCH
                         Are you sure?

                                     FABIENNE
                              (shaking)
                         No.

               Butch freaks out, he punches the air.

               Fabienne SCREAMS and backs into a corner, Butch picks up the 
               motel TV and THROWS IT AGAINST the wall.

               Fabienne SCREAMS IN HORROR.

               Butch looks toward her, suddenly calm.

                                     BUTCH
                              (to Fabienne)
                         No! It's not your fault.
                              (he approached her)
                         You left it at the apartment.

               He bends down in front of the woman who has sunk to the floor.

               He touches her hand, she flinches.

                                     BUTCH
                         If you did leave it at the apartment, 
                         it's not your fault. I had you bring 
                         a bunch of stuff. I reminded you 
                         about it, but I didn't illustrate 
                         how personal the watch was to me. If 
                         all I gave a fuck about was my watch, 
                         I should've told you. You ain't a 
                         mind reader.

               He kisses her hand. Then rises.

               Fabienne is still sniffling.

               Butch goes to the closet.

                                     FABIENNE
                         I'm sorry.

               Butch puts on his high school jacket.

                                     BUTCH
                         Don't be. It just means I won't be 
                         able to eat breakfast with you.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Why does it mean that?

                                     BUTCH
                         Because I'm going back to my apartment 
                         to get my watch.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Won't the gangsters be looking for 
                         you there?

                                     BUTCH
                         That's what I'm gonna find out. If 
                         they are, and I don't think I can 
                         handle it, I'll split.

               Rising from the floor.

                                     FABIENNE
                         I was so dreadful. I saw your watch, 
                         I thought I brought it. I'm so sorry.

               Butch brings her close and puts his hands on her face.

                                     BUTCH
                         Don't feel bad, sugar pop. Nothing 
                         you could ever do would make me 
                         permanently angry at you.
                              (pause)
                         I love you, remember?
                              (he digs some money 
                              out of his wallet)
                         Now here's some money, order those 
                         pancakes and have a great breakfast.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Don't go.

                                     BUTCH
                         I'll be back before you can say, 
                         blueberry pie.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Blueberry pie.

                                     BUTCH
                         Well maybe not that fast, but fast. 
                         Okay?  Okay?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Okay.

               He kisses her once more and heads for the door.

                                     BUTCH
                         Bye-bye, sugar pop.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Bye.

                                     BUTCH
                         I'm gonna take your Honda.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Okay.

               And with that, he's out the door.

               Fabienne sits on the bed and looks at the money he gave her.

               INT. HONDA (MOVING)  DAY

               Butch is beating the steering wheel and the dash with his 
               fists as he drives down the street.

                                     BUTCH
                         Of all the fuckin' things she coulda 
                         forgot, she forgets my father's watch. 
                         I specifically reminded her not to 
                         forget it. "Bedside table  on the 
                         kangaroo." I said the words: "Don't 
                         forget my father's watch."

               EXT. CITY STREET  DAY

               The little Honda races toward its destination as fast as is 
               little engine will take it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A parking meter red flag rises up, then out, leaving the 
               arrow pointing at one hour.

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET CORNER  DAY

               Butch isn't completely reckless. He has parked his car a 
               couple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before 
               he goes boppin' through the front door.

               EXT. ALLEY  DAY

               Butch walks down the alley until he gets to another street, 
               then he discreetly glances out.

               EXT. STREET  BUTCH'S APARTMENT  DAY

               Everything seems normal. More or less the right number of 
               cars in the street. None of the parked cars appear out of 
               place. None of them have a couple of goons sitting inside.  
               Basically, it looks like normal morning activity in front of 
               Butch's home.

               Butch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information.

               Butch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything. He 
               crosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard.

               Across the street from Butch's building, on the corner, is a 
               combination donut shop and Japanese restaurant. A big sign 
               sticks up in the air, with the name "Teriyaki Donut" and a 
               graphic of a donut sticking out of a bowl of rice.

               EXT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT COURTYARD  DAY

               Butch is in the courtyard of his North Hollywood apartment 
               building. Once again, everything appears normal  the laundry 
               room, the pool, his apartment door  nothing appears 
               disturbed.

               Butch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment, number 12. 
               He steps outside the door and listens inside. Nothing.

               Butch slowly inserts the key into the door, quietly opening 
               it.

               INT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT  DAY

               His apartment hasn't been touched.

               He cautiously steps inside, shuts the door and takes a quick 
               look around. Obviously, no one is there.

               Butch walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the 
               refrigerator.

               He takes out a carton of milk and drinks from it.

               With carton in hard, Butch surveys the apartment. Then he 
               goes to the bedroom.

               His bedroom is like the rest of the apartment  neat, clean 
               and anonymous. The only things personal in his room are a 
               few boxing trophies, an Olympic silver medal, a framed issue 
               of "Ring Magazine" with Butch on the cover, and a poster of 
               Jerry Quarry and one of George Chuvalo.

               Sure enough, there's the watch just like he said it was: On 
               the bedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue.

               He walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen. He 
               opens a cupboard and takes out a box of Pop Tarts. Putting 
               down the milk, he opens the box, takes out two Pop Tarts and 
               puts them in the toaster.

               Butch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something.

               What he sees is a small compact Czech M61 submachine gun 
               with a huge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter.

                                     BUTCH
                              (softly)
                         Holy shit.

               He picks up the intimidating peace of weaponry and examines 
               it.

               Then... a toilet FLUSHES.

               Butch looks up to the bathroom door, which is parallel to 
               the kitchen. There is someone behind it.

               Like a rabbit caught in a radish patch, Butch freezes, not 
               knowing what to do.

               The bathroom door opens and Vincent Vega steps out of the 
               bathroom, tightening his belt. In his hand is the book 
               "MODESTY BLAISE" by Peter O'Donnell.

               Vincent and Butch lock eyes.

               Vincent freezes.

               Butch doesn't move, except to point the M61 in Vincent's 
               direction.

               Neither man opens his mouth.

               Then... the toaster LOUDLY kicks up the Pop Tarts.

               That's all the situation needed.

               Butch's finger HITS the trigger.

               MUFFLED FIRE SHOOTS out of the end of the gun.

               Vincent is seemingly WRACKED with twenty bullets 
               SIMULTANEOUSLY  LIFTING him off his feet, PROPELLING him 
               through the air and CRASHING through the glass shower door 
               at the end of the bathroom.

               By the time Butch removes his finger from the trigger, Vincent 
               is annihilated.

               Butch stands frozen, amazed at what just happened. His look 
               goes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once 
               Vincent, down to the powerful piece of artillery in his grip.

               With the respect it deserves, Butch carefully places the M61 
               back on the kitchen counter.

               Then he exits the apartment, quickly.

               EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD  DAY

               Butch, not running, but walking very rapidly, crosses the 
               courtyard...

               ...comes out of the apartment building, crosses the street...

               ...goes through the alley...

               ...and into his car in one STEADICAM SHOT.

               EXT. HONDA  DAY

               Butch CRANKS the car into gear and drives away. The big wide 
               smile of a survivor breaks across his face.

               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING STREET  DAY

               The Honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his 
               apartment building.

               INT. HONDA  DAY

               Butch looks out the window at his former home.

                                     BUTCH
                         That's how you're gonna beat 'em, 
                         Butch.  They keep underestimatin' 
                         ya.

               This makes the boxer laugh out loud. As he laughs, he flips 
               a tape in the cassette player. When the MUSIC starts, he 
               SINGS along with it.

               He drives by the apartment, but is stopped at the light on 
               the corner across from Teriyaki Donut.

               Butch is still chuckling, singing along with the song, as we 
               see:

               THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

               The big man himself, Marsellus Wallace, exit Teriyaki Donut, 
               carrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam 
               cups of coffee. He steps off the curb, crossing the street 
               in front of Butch's car. This is the first time we see 
               Marsellus clearly.

               Laughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front 
               of him.

               When Marsellus is in front of Butch's car, he casually glances 
               to his left, sees Butch, continues walking... then STOPS!

               DOUBLE-TAKE: "Am I really seeing what I'm seeing?"

               Butch doesn't wait for the big man to answer his own question. 
               He STOMPS on the gas pedal.

               The little Honda SLAMS into Marsellus, sending him, the donuts 
               and the coffee HITTING the pavement at thirty miles an hour.

               Butch CUTS into cross traffic and is BROAD-SIDED by a gold 
               Camaro Z-28, BREAKING all the windows in the Honda and sending 
               it up on the sidewalk.

               Butch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what 
               at one time was Fabienne's Honda. Blood flows from his 
               nostrils. The still-functional tape player continues to play. 
               A PEDESTRIAN pokes his head inside.

                                     PEDESTRIAN
                         Jesus, are you okay?

               Butch look at him, spaced-out.

                                     BUTCH
                         I guess.

               Marsellus Wallace lies sprawled out in the street. GAWKERS 
               gather around the body.

                                     GAWKER #1
                              (to the others)
                         He's dead! He's dead!

               This jerk's yelling makes Marsellus come to.

               TWO PEDESTRIANS help the shaken Butch out of the wreckage.

               The woozy Marsellus gets to his feet.

                                     GAWKER #2
                         If you need a witness in court, I'll 
                         be glad to help. He was a drunken 
                         maniac. He hit you and crashed into 
                         that car.

                                     MARSELLUS
                              (still incoherent)
                         Who?

                                     GAWKER #2
                              (pointing at Butch)
                         Him.

               Marsellus follows the Gawker's finger and sees Butch Coolidge 
               down the street, looking a shambles.

                                     MARSELLUS
                         Well, I'll be damned.

               The big man takes out a .45 Automatic and the Gawkers back 
               away.

               Marsellus starts moving toward Butch.

               Butch sees the fierce figure making a wobbly bee-line toward 
               him.

                                     BUTCH
                         Sacre bleu.

               Marsellus brings up his weapon and FIRES, but he's so hurt, 
               shaky and dazed that his arm goes wild.

               He HITS a LOOKY-LOO WOMAN in the hip. She falls to the ground, 
               screaming.

                                     LOOKY-LOO WOMAN
                         Oh my God, I've been shot!

               That's all Butch needs to see. He's outta here.

               Marsellus RUNS after him.

               The CROWD looks agape.

               Butch is in a mad, limping RUN.

               The big man's hot on his ass with a cockeyed wobbly run.

               Butch cuts across traffic and dashes into a business with a 
               sign that reads "MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP".

               INT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP  DAY

               MAYNARD, a hillbilly-lookin' boy, stands behind the counter 
               of his pawnshop when, all of a sudden, chaos in the form of 
               Butch RACES into his world.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Can I help you wit' somethin'?

                                     BUTCH
                         Shut up!

               Butch quickly takes measure of the situation, than stands 
               next to the door.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Now you just wait one goddamn minute 
                         

               Before Maynard can finish his threat, Marsellus CHARGES in. 
               He doesn't get past the doorway because Butch LANDS his fist 
               in Marsellus' face.

               The gangster's feet go out from under him and the big man 
               FALLS FLAT on his back.

               Outside, two police cars with their SIRENS BLARING race by.

               Butch POUNCES on the fallen body, PUNCHING him twice more in 
               the face.

               Butch takes the gun out of Marsellus' hand, than grabs ahold 
               of his middle finger.

                                     BUTCH
                         So you like chasing people, huh?

               He BREAKS the finger. Marsellus lets out a pain sound.  Butch 
               then places the barrel of the .45 between his eyes, PULLS 
               back the hammer and places his open hand behind the gun to 
               shield the splatter.

                                     BUTCH
                         Well guess what, big man, you caught 
                         me 

                                     MAYNARD (O.S.)
                          hold it right there, godammit!

               Butch and Marsellus look up at Maynard, who's brandishing a 
               pumpaction shotgun, aimed at the two men.

                                     BUTCH
                         Look mister, this ain't any of your 
                         business 

                                     MAYNARD
                          I'm makin' it my business! Now 
                         toss that gun!

               Butch does.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Now you on top, stand up and come to 
                         the counter.

               Butch slowly gets up and moves to the counter. As soon as he 
               gets there, Maynard HAULS OFF, HITTING him hard in the face 
               with the butt of the shotgun, knocking Butch down and out.

               After Butch goes down, Maynard calmly lays the shotgun on 
               the counter and moves to the telephone.

               Marsellus Wallace, from his position on the floor, groggily 
               watches the pawnshop owner dial a number. Maynard waits on 
               the line while the other end rings. Then it picks up.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Zed? It's Maynard. The spider just 
                         caught a coupl'a flies.

               Marsellus passes out.

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

               FADE UP:

               INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM  DAY

               TWO SHOT  BUTCH AND MARSELLUS

               They are tied up in two separate chairs. In their mouths are 
               two S&M-style ball gags (a belt goes around their heads and 
               a little red ball sticks in their mouths). Both men are 
               unconscious.

               Maynard steps in with a fire extinguisher and SPRAYS both 
               guys until they're wide awake and wet as otters. The two 
               prisoners look up at their captors.

               Maynard stands in front of them, fire extinguisher in one 
               hand, shotgun in the other, and Marsellus' .45 sticking in 
               his belt.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Nobody kills anybody in my place of 
                         business except me or Zed.

               A BUZZER buzzes.

                                     MAYNARD
                         That's Zed.

               Without saying another word, Maynard climbs up the stairs 
               that lead to red curtains and goes through them.

               WE HEAR, on the other side of the curtains, Maynard let Zed 
               inside the store.

               Butch and Marsellus look around the room. The basement of 
               the pawnshop has been converted into a dungeon. After taking 
               in their predicament, Butch and Marsellus look at each other, 
               all traces of hostility gone, replaced by a terror they both 
               share at what they've gotten themselves into.

               Maynard and ZED come through the curtains. Zed is an even 
               more intense version of Maynard, if such a thing is possible. 
               The two hillbillys are obviously brothers. Where Maynard is 
               a vicious pitbull, Zed is a deadly cobra. Zed walks in and 
               stands in front of the two captives. He inspects them for a 
               long time, then says:

                                     ZED
                              (to Maynard)
                         You said you waited for me?

                                     MAYNARD
                         I did.

                                     ZED
                         Then how come they're all beat up?

                                     MAYNARD
                         They did that to each other. They 
                         was fightin' when they came in. This 
                         one was gonna shoot that one.

                                     ZED
                              (to Butch)
                         You were gonna shoot him?

               Butch makes no reply.

                                     ZED
                         Hey, is Grace gonna be okay in front 
                         of this place?

                                     MAYNARD
                         Yeah, it ain't Tuesday is it?

                                     ZED
                         No, it's Thursday.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Then she'll be fine.

                                     ZED
                         Bring out The Gimp.

                                     MAYNARD
                         I think The Gimp's sleepin'.

                                     ZED
                         Well, I guess you'll just wake 'em 
                         up then, won't you?

               Maynard opens a trap door in the floor.

                                     MAYNARD
                              (yelling in the hole)
                         Wake up!

               Maynard reaches into the hole and comes back holding onto a 
               leash.

               He gives it a rough yank and, from below the floor, rises 
               THE GIMP.

               The Gimp is a man they keep dressed from head to toe in black 
               leather bondage gear. There are zippers, buckles and studs 
               here and there on the body. On his head is a black leather 
               mask with two eye holes and a zipper (closed) for a mouth. 
               They keep him in a hole in the floor big enough for a large 
               dog.

               Zed takes the chair, sits it in front of the two prisoners, 
               then lowers into it. Maynard hands The Gimp's leash to Zed, 
               then backs away.

                                     MAYNARD
                              (to The Gimp)
                         Down!

               The Gimp gets on its knees.

               Maynard hangs back while Zed appraises the two men.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Who's first?

                                     ZED
                         I ain't fer sure yet.

               Then with his little finger, Zed does a silent "Eenie, meany, 
               miney, moe... " just his mouth mouthing the words and his 
               finger going back and forth between the two.

               Butch are Marsellus are terrified.

               Maynard looks back and forth at the victims.

               The Gimps's eyes go from one to the other inside the mask.

               Zed continues his silent sing-song with his finger moving 
               left to right, then it stops.

               TWO SHOT  BUTCH AND MARSELLUS

               After a beat, THE CAMERA MOVES to the right, zeroing in on 
               Marsellus.

               Zed stands up.

                                     ZED
                         Wanna do it here?

                                     MAYNARD
                         Naw, drag big boy to Russell's old 
                         room.

               Zed grabs Marsellus' chair and DRAGS him into Russell's old 
               room.

               Russell, no doubt, was some other poor bastard that has the 
               misfortune of stumbling into the Mason-Dixie pawnshop. 
               Whatever happened to Russell is known only to Maynard and 
               Zed because his old room, a back room in the back of the 
               back room, is empty.

               As Marsellus is dragged away, he locks eyes with Butch before 
               he disappears behind the door of Russell's old room.

                                     MAYNARD
                              (to The Gimp)
                         Up!

               The Gimp rises. Maynard ties The Gimp's leash to a hook on 
               the ceiling.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Keep an eye on this one.

               The Gimp bows its head: "yes." Maynard disappears into 
               Russell's old room. There must be a stereo in there because 
               suddenly The Judds, singing in harmony, fills the air.

               Butch looks at The Gimp. The Gimp giggles from underneath 
               the mask as if this were the funniest moment in the history 
               of comedy.

               From behind the door we hear country MUSIC, struggling, and:

                                     MAYNARD (O.S.)
                         Whoa, this boy's got a bit of fight 
                         in 'em!

               We the HEAR Maynard and Zed beat on Marsellus.

                                     ZED (O.S.)
                         You wanna fight? You wanna fight? 
                         Good, I like to fight!

               Butch pauses, listens to the voices. Then, in a panic, 
               hurriedly struggles to get free.

               The Gimp is laughing wildly.

               The ropes are on too tight and Butch can't break free.

               The Gimp slaps his knee laughing In the back room, we hear:

                                     MAYNARD (O.S.)
                         That's it... that's it boy, you're 
                         goin' fine. Oooooooh, just like 
                         that... that's good.
                              (grunting faster)
                         Stay still... stay still goddamn ya! 
                         Zed goddammit, git over here and 
                         hold 'em!

               Butch stops struggling and lifts up on his arms. Then, quite 
               easily, the padded chair back slides up and off as if it 
               were never connected by a bolt.

               The Gimp sees this and its eyes widen.

                                     THE GIMP
                         Huhng?

               The Gimp FLAILS WILDLY, trying to get the leash off the hook. 
               He tries to yell, but all that comes out are excited gurgles 
               and grunts.

               Butch is out of his chair, quickly dispensing three BOXER'S 
               PUNCHES to its face. The punches knock The Gimp out, making 
               him fall to his knees, this HANGING HIMSELF by the leash 
               attached to the hook, Butch removes the ball gag, then 
               silently makes his way through the red curtains.

               INT. PAWNSHOP  DAY

               Butch sneaks to the door.

               On the counter is a big set of keys with a large Z connected 
               to the ring. Grabbing them, he's about to go out when he 
               stops and listens to the hillbilly psychopaths having their 
               way with Marsellus.

               Butch decides for the life of him, he can't leave anybody in 
               a situation like that. Se he begins rooting around the 
               pawnshop for a weapon to bash those hillbillies' heads in 
               with.

               He picks up a big destructive-looking hammer, then discards 
               it: Not destructive enough. He picks up a chainsaw, thinks 
               about it for a moment, then puts it back. Next, a large 
               Louisville slugger he tries on for size. But then he spots 
               what he's been looking for:

               A Samurai sword.

               It hands in its hand-carved wood sheath from a nail on the 
               wall, next to a neon "DAD'S OLD-FASHIONED ROOT BEER" sign. 
               Butch takes the sword off the wall, removing it from its 
               sheath. It's a magnificent piece of steel. It seems to glisten 
               in the low-wattage light of the pawnshop. Butch touches his 
               thumb to the blade to see if the sword is just for show. Not 
               on your life. It's as sharp as it gets. This weapon seems 
               made to order for the Brothers Grimm downstairs. Holding the 
               sword pointed downward, Takakura Kenstyle, he disappears 
               through the red curtains to take care of business.

               INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM  DAY

               Butch quietly sneaks down the stairs leading to the dungeon.

               Sodomy and the Judds can still be heard going string behind 
               the closed door that leads to Russell's old room.

               INT. RUSSELL'S OLD ROOM  DAY

               Butch's hand comes into frame, pushing the door open. It 
               swings open silently, revealing the rapists, who have switched 
               positions.

               Zed is now bent over Marsellus, who is bent over a wooden 
               horse.

               Maynard watches. Both have their backs to Butch.

               Maynard faces the CAMERA, grinning, while Butch comes up 
               behind him with the sword.

               Miserable, violated, and looking like a rag doll, Marsellus, 
               red ball gag still in mouth, opens his watery eyes to see 
               Butch coming up behind Maynard. His eyes widen.

                                     BUTCH
                         Hey hillbilly.

               Maynard turns and sees Butch holding the sword.

               Butch SCREAMS... with one mighty SWING, SLASHES Maynard across 
               the front, moving past him, eyes and blade now locked on 
               Zed.

               Maynard stands trembling, his front sliced open, in shock.

               Butch, while never taking his eyes off Zed, THRUSTS the sword 
               behind him, SKEWERING Maynard, then EXTRACTS it, pointing 
               the blade toward Zed. Maynard COLLAPSES.

               Zed disengages from Marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go 
               from the tip of Butch's sword to Marsellus' .45 Automatic, 
               which lies within reach.

               Butch's eyes follow Zed's.

                                     BUTCH
                         You want that gun, Zed? Pick it up.

               Zed's hand inches toward the weapon.

               Butch GRIPS the sword tighter.

               Zed studies Butch.

               Butch looks hard at Zed.

               Then a VOICE says:

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)
                         Step aside, Butch.

               Butch steps aside, REVEALING Marsellus standing behind him, 
               holding Maynard's pump-action shotgun.

               KABOOM!!!!

               Zed is BLASTED in the groin. Down he goes, SCREAMING in AGONY.

               Marsellus, looking down at his whimpering rapist, EJECTS the 
               used shotgun shell.

               Butch lowers the sword and hangs back. Not a word, until:

                                     BUTCH
                         You okay?

                                     MARSELLUS
                         Naw man. I'm pretty fuckin' far from 
                         okay!

               Long pause.

                                     BUTCH
                         What now?

                                     MARSELLUS
                         What now? Well let me tell you what 
                         now.  I'm gonna call a couple pipe-
                         hittin' niggers, who'll go to work 
                         on homes here with a pair of pliers 
                         and a blow torch.
                              (to Zed)
                         Hear me talkin' hillbilly boy?! I 
                         ain't through with you by a damn 
                         sight. I'm gonna git Medieval on 
                         your ass.

                                     BUTCH
                         I meant what now, between me and 
                         you?

                                     MARSELLUS
                         Oh, that what now? Well, let me tell 
                         ya what now between me an' you. There 
                         is no me an' you. Not no more.

                                     BUTCH
                         So we're cool?

                                     MARSELLUS
                         Yeah man, we're cool. One thing I 
                         ask  two things I ask: Don't tell 
                         nobody about this. This shit's between 
                         me and you and the soon-to-be-livin'-
                         the-rest-of-his-short-ass-life-in-
                         agonizing-pain, Mr. Rapist here. It 
                         ain't nobody else's business. Two: 
                         leave town. Tonight. Right now. And 
                         when you're gone, stay gone.  You've 
                         lost your Los Angeles privileges.  
                         Deal?

                                     BUTCH
                         Deal.

               The two men shake hands, then hug one another.

                                     MARSELLUS
                         Go on now, get your ass outta here.

               Butch leaves Russell's old room through the red curtains.

               Marsellus walks over to a phone, dialing a number.

                                     MARSELLUS
                              (into the phone)
                         Hello Mr. Wolf, it's Marsellus. Gotta 
                         bit of a situation.

               EXT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP  DAY

               Butch, still shaking in his boots, exits the pawnshop. He 
               looks ahead and sees, parked in front of the establishment, 
               Zed's Big Chrome Chopper with a teardrop gas tank that has 
               the name "GRACE" on it. He climbs aboard, takes out the keys 
               with the big Z on them and starts up the huge hog. It RUMBLES 
               to life, making sounds like a rocket fighting for orbit. 
               Butch twists the accelerator handle and SPEEDS off.

               WE CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN...

               INT. BUTCH AND FABIENNE'S HOTEL ROOM  DAY

               Fabienne stands in front of a mirror wearing a "Frankie says, 
               Relax" tee-shirt, singing along with MUSIC coming from a 
               BOOM BOX.

               EXT. CITY STREET  CHOPPER (MOVING)  DAY

               Butch drives down the street, humping a hot hog named "GRACE." 
               He checks his father's watch. It says: 10:30.

               The SONG in the motel room PLAYS OVER this.

               EXT. MOTEL ROOM  DAY

               Butch rides up on Grace. He hops off and runs inside the 
               motel room, while we stay outside with the bike.

                                     FABIENNE (O.S.)
                         Butch, I was so worried!

                                     BUTCH
                         Honey, grab your radio and your purse 
                         and let's go!

                                     FABIENNE (O.S.)
                         But what about all our bags?

                                     BUTCH
                         Fuck the bags. We'll miss our train 
                         if we don't split now.

                                     FABIENNE (O.S.)
                         Is everything well? Are we in danger?

                                     BUTCH
                         We're cool. In fact, we're super-
                         cool. But we gots to go. I'll wait 
                         for you outside.

               Butch runs out and hops back on the bike. Fabienne exits the 
               motel room with the boom box and a large purse. When she 
               sees Butch on the chopper, she stops dead.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Where did you get this motorcycle?

                                     BUTCH
                              (he kick-starts it)
                         It's a chopper, baby, hop on.

               Fabienne slowly approaches the two-wheel demon.

                                     FABIENNE
                         What happened to my Honda?

                                     BUTCH
                         Sorry baby, I crashed the Honda.

                                     FABIENNE
                         You're hurt?

                                     BUTCH
                         I might've broke my nose, no biggie. 
                         Hop on.

               She doesn't move.

               Butch looks at her.

                                     BUTCH
                         Honey, we gotta hit the fuckin' road!

               Fabienne starts to cry.

               Butch realizes that this is not the way to get her on the 
               bike. He turns off the engine and reaches out, taking her 
               hand.

                                     BUTCH
                         I'm sorry, baby-love.

                                     FABIENNE
                              (crying)
                         You were gone so long, I started to 
                         think dreadful thoughts.

                                     BUTCH
                         I'm sorry I worried you, sweetie.
                         Everything's fine. Hey, how was 
                         breakfast?

                                     FABIENNE
                              (waterworks drying a 
                              little)
                         It was good 

                                     BUTCH
                          did you get the blueberry pancakes?

                                     FABIENNE
                         No, they didn't have blueberry 
                         pancakes, I had to get buttermilk  
                         are you sure you're okay?

                                     BUTCH
                         Baby-love, from the moment I left 
                         you, this has been without a doubt 
                         the single weirdest day of my entire 
                         life. Climb on an' I'll tell ya about 
                         it.

               Fabienne does climb on. Butch STARTS her up.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Butch, whose motorcycle is this?

                                     BUTCH
                         It's a chopper.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Whose chopper is this?

                                     BUTCH
                         Zed's.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Who's Zed?

                                     BUTCH
                         Zed's dead, baby, Zed's dead.

               And with that, the two lovebirds PEEL AWAY on Grace, as the 
               SONG on the BOOM BOX RISES.

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

               TITLE CARD:

                            "JULES VINCENT JIMMIE & THE WOLF"

               TITLE DISAPPEARS.

               Over black, we can HEAR in the distance, men talking.

                                     JULES (O.S.)
                         You ever read the Bible, Brett?

                                     BRETT (O.S.)
                         Yes!

                                     JULES (O.S.)
                         There's a passage I got memorized, 
                         seems appropriate for this situation: 
                         Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the 
                         righteous man is beset on all sides 
                         by the inequities of the selfish and 
                         the tyranny of evil men..."

               FADE UP:

               INT. BATHROOM  DAY

               We're in the bathroom of the Hollywood apartment we were in 
               earlier. In fact, we're there at exactly the same time. Except 
               this time, we're in the bathroom with the FOURTH MAN. The 
               Fourth Man is pacing around the small room, listening hard 
               to what's being said on the other side of the door, tightly 
               CLUTCHING his huge silver .357 Magnum.

                                     JULES (O.S.)
                         "...blessed is he who, in the name 
                         of charity and good will, shepherded 
                         the weak through the valley of 
                         darkness. And I will strike down 
                         upon thee with great vengeance and 
                         furious anger those who attempt to 
                         poison and destroy my brothers. And 
                         you will know I am the Lord when I 
                         lay my vengeance upon you."

               BANG! BANG! BOOM! POW! BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM!

               The Fourth Man freaks out. He THROWS himself against the 
               back wall, gun outstretched in front of him, a look of yellow 
               fear on his face, ready to blow in half anybody fool enough 
               to stick their head through that door.

               Then he listens to them talk.

                                     VINCENT (O.S.)
                         Friend of yours?

                                     JULES (O.S.)
                         Yeah, Marvin-Vincent-Vincent-Marvin.

               Waiting for them isn't the smartest move. Bursting out the 
               door and blowing them all away while they're fuckin' around 
               is the way to go.

               INT. APARTMENT  DAY

               The bathroom door BURSTS OPEN and the Fourth Man CHARGES 
               out, silver Magnum raised, FIRING SIX BOOMING SHOTS from his 
               hand cannon.

                                     FOURTH MAN
                         Die... die... die... die...!

               DOLLY INTO Fourth Man, same as before.

               He SCREAM until he's dry firing. Then a look of confusion 
               crosses his face.

               TWO SHOT  JULES AND VINCENT

               Standing next to each other, unharmed. Amazing as it seems, 
               none of the Fourth Man's shots appear to have hit anybody. 
               Jules and Vincent exchange looks like, "Are we hit?" They're 
               as confused at the shooter. After looking at each other, 
               they bring their looks up to the Fourth Man.

                                     FOURTH MAN
                         I don't understand 

               The Fourth Man is taken out of the scenario by the two men's 
               bullets who, unlike his, HIT their marks. He drops DEAD.

               The two men lower their guns. Jules, obviously shaken, sits 
               down in a chair. Vincent, after a moment of respect, shrugs 
               it off.

               Then heads toward Marvin in the corner.

                                     VINCENT
                         Why the fuck didn't you tell us about 
                         that guy in the bathroom? Slip your 
                         mind?  Forget he was in there with a 
                         goddamn hand cannon?

                                     JULES
                              (to himself)
                         We should be fuckin' dead right now.
                              (pause)
                         Did you see that gun he fired at us? 
                         It was bigger than him.

                                     VINCENT
                         .357.

                                     JULES
                         We should be fuckin' dead!

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah, we were lucky.

               Jules rises, moving toward Vincent.

                                     JULES
                         That shit wasn't luck. That shit was 
                         somethin' else.

               Vincent prepares to leave.

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah, maybe.

                                     JULES
                         That was... divine intervention. You 
                         know what divine intervention is?

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah, I think so. That means God 
                         came down from Heaven and stopped 
                         the bullets.

                                     JULES
                         Yeah, man, that's what is means. 
                         That's exactly what it means! God 
                         came down from Heaven and stopped 
                         the bullets.

                                     VINCENT
                         I think we should be going now.

                                     JULES
                         Don't do that! Don't you fuckin' do 
                         that!  Don't blow this shit off! 
                         What just happened was a fuckin' 
                         miracle!

                                     VINCENT
                         Chill the fuck out, Jules, this shit 
                         happens.

                                     JULES
                         Wrong, wrong, this shit doesn't just 
                         happen.

                                     VINCENT
                         Do you wanna continue this theological 
                         discussion in the car, or at the 
                         jailhouse with the cops?

                                     JULES
                         We should be fuckin' dead now, my 
                         friend!  We just witnessed a miracle, 
                         and I want you to fuckin' acknowledge 
                         it!

                                     VINCENT
                         Okay man, it was a miracle, can we 
                         leave now?

               EXT. HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT BUILDING  MORNING

               The Chevy Nova PROPELS itself into traffic.

               INT. NOVA (MOVING)  MORNING

               Jules is behind the wheel,Vincent in the passenger seat and 
               Marvin in the back.

                                     VINCENT
                         ...Ever seen that show "COPS?"  I 
                         was watchin' it once and this cop 
                         was on it who was talkin' about this 
                         time he got into this gun fight with 
                         a guy in a hallway. He unloads on 
                         this guy and he doesn't hit anything. 
                         And these guys were in a hallway. 
                         It's a freak, but it happens.

                                     JULES
                         If you wanna play blind man, then go 
                         walk with a Shepherd. But me, my 
                         eyes are wide fuckin' open.

                                     VINCENT
                         What the fuck does that mean?

                                     JULES
                         That's it for me. For here on in, 
                         you can consider my ass retired.

                                     VINCENT
                         Jesus Christ!

                                     JULES
                         Don't blaspheme!

                                     VINCENT
                         Goddammit, Jules 

                                     JULES
                          I said don't do that 

                                     VINCENT
                          you're fuckin' freakin' out!

                                     JULES
                         I'm tellin' Marsellus today I'm 
                         through.

                                     VINCENT
                         While you're at it, be sure to tell 
                         'im why.

                                     JULES
                         Don't worry, I will.

                                     VINCENT
                         I'll bet ya ten thousand dollars, he 
                         laughs his ass off.

                                     JULES
                         I don't give a damn if he does.

               Vincent turns to the backseat with the .45 casually in his 
               grip.

                                     VINCENT
                         Marvin, what do you make of all this?

                                     MARVIN
                         I don't even have an opinion.

                                     VINCENT
                         C'mon, Marvin. Do you think God came 
                         down from Heaven and stopped the 
                         bullets?

               Vincent's .45 goes BANG!

               Marvin is hit in the upper chest, below the throat. He GURGLES 
               blood and SHAKES.

                                     JULES
                         What the fuck's happening?

                                     VINCENT
                         I just accidentally shot Marvin in 
                         the throat.

                                     JULES
                         Why the fuck did you do that?

                                     VINCENT
                         I didn't mean to do it. I said it 
                         was an accident.

                                     JULES
                         I've seen a lot of crazy-ass shit in 
                         my time 

                                     VINCENT
                          chill out, man, it was an accident, 
                         okay? You hit a bump or somethin' 
                         and the gun went off.

                                     JULES
                         The car didn't hit no motherfuckin' 
                         bump!

                                     VINCENT
                         Look! I didn't mean to shoot this 
                         son-ofa-bitch, the gun just went 
                         off, don't ask me how!

                                     JULES
                         Look at this mess! We're drivin' 
                         around on a city street in broad 
                         daylight 

                                     VINCENT
                          I know, I know, I wasn't thinkin' 
                         about the splatter.

                                     JULES
                         Well you better be thinkin' about it 
                         now, motherfucker! We gotta get this 
                         car off the road. Cops tend to notice 
                         shit like you're driving a car 
                         drenched in fuckin' blood.

                                     VINCENT
                         Can't we just take it to a friendly 
                         place?

                                     JULES
                         This is the Valley, Vincent. Marsellus 
                         don't got no friendly places in the 
                         Valley.

                                     VINCENT
                         Well, don't look at me, this is your 
                         town, Jules.

               Jules takes out a cellular phone and starts punching digits.

                                     VINCENT
                         Who ya callin'?

                                     JULES
                         A buddy of mine in Toluca Lake.

                                     VINCENT
                         Where's Toluca Lake.

                                     JULES
                         On the other side of the hill, by 
                         Burbank Studios. If Jimmie's ass 
                         ain't home, I don't know what the 
                         fuck we're gonna go. I ain't got any 
                         other partners in 818.
                              (into phone)
                         Jimmie! How you doin' man, it's Jules.
                              (pause)
                         Listen up man, me an' my homeboy are 
                         in some serious shit. We're in a car 
                         we gotta get off the road, pronto! I 
                         need to use your garage for a couple 
                         hours.

               INT. JIMMIE'S BATHROOM  DAY

               Jules is bent over a sink, washing his bloody hands while 
               Vincent stands behind him.

                                     JULES
                         We gotta be real fuckin' delicate 
                         with this Jimmie's situation. He's 
                         one remark away from kickin' our 
                         asses out the door.

                                     VINCENT
                         If he kicks us out, whadda we do?

                                     JULES
                         Well, we ain't leavin' 'til we made 
                         a couple phone calls. But I never 
                         want it to reach that pitch. Jimmie's 
                         my friend and you don't bust in your 
                         friend's house and start tellin' 'im 
                         what's what.

               Jules rises and dries his hands. Vincent takes his place at 
               the sink.

                                     VINCENT
                         Just tell 'im not to be abusive. He 
                         kinda freaked out back there when he 
                         saw Marvin.

                                     JULES
                         Put yourself in his position. It's 
                         eight o'clock in the morning. He 
                         just woke up, he wasn't prepared for 
                         this shit. Don't forget who's doin' 
                         who a favor.

               Vincent finishes, then dries his hands on a white towel.

                                     VINCENT
                         If the price of that favor is I gotta 
                         take shit, he can stick his favor 
                         straight up his ass.

               When Vincent is finished drying his hands, the towel is 
               stained with red.

                                     JULES
                         What the fuck did you just do to his 
                         towel?

                                     VINCENT
                         I was just dryin' my hands.

                                     JULES
                         You're supposed to wash 'em first.

                                     VINCENT
                         You watched me wash 'em.

                                     JULES
                         I watched you get 'em wet.

                                     VINCENT
                         I washed 'em. Blood's real hard to 
                         get off. Maybe if he had some Lava, 
                         I coulda done a better job.

                                     JULES
                         I used the same soap you did and 
                         when I dried my hands, the towel 
                         didn't look like a fuckin' Maxie 
                         pad. Look, fuck it, alright. Who 
                         cares? But it's shit like this that's 
                         gonna bring this situation to a boil. 
                         If he were to come in here and see 
                         that towel like that... I'm tellin' 
                         you Vincent, you best be cool. 'Cause 
                         if I gotta get in to it with Jimmie 
                         on account of you... Look, I ain't 
                         threatenin' you, I respect you an' 
                         all, just don't put me in that 
                         position.

                                     JULES
                         Jules, you ask me nice like that, no 
                         problem. He's your friend, you handle 
                         him.

               INT. JIMMIE'S KITCHEN  MORNING

               Three men are standing in Jimmie's kitchen, each with a mug 
               of coffee. Jules, Vincent and JIMMIE DIMMICK, a young man in 
               his late 20s dressed in a bathrobe.

                                     JULES
                         Goddamn Jimmie, this is some serious 
                         gourmet shit. Me an' Vincent woulda 
                         been satisfied with freeze-dried 
                         Tasters Choice. You spring this 
                         gourmet fuckin' shit on us. What 
                         flavor is this?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Knock it off, Julie.

                                     JULES
                         What?

                                     JIMMIE
                         I'm not a cobb or corn, so you can 
                         stop butterin' me up. I don't need 
                         you to tell me how good my coffee 
                         is. I'm the one who buys it, I know 
                         how fuckin' good it is.  When Bonnie 
                         goes shoppin;, she buys shit.  I buy 
                         the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause 
                         when I drink it, I wanna taste it. 
                         But what's on my mind at this moment 
                         isn't the coffee in my kitchen, it's 
                         the dead nigger in my garage.

                                     JULES
                         Jimmie 

                                     JIMMIE
                          I'm talkin'. Now let me ask you a 
                         question, Jules. When you drove in 
                         here, did you notice a sign out front 
                         that said, "Dead nigger storage?"

               Jules starts to "Jimmie" him 

                                     JIMMIE
                          answer to question. Did you see a 
                         sign out in front of my house that 
                         said, "Dead nigger storage?"

                                     JULES
                              (playing along)
                         Naw man, I didn't.

                                     JIMMIE
                         You know why you didn't see that 
                         sign?

                                     JULES
                         Why?

                                     JIMMIE
                         'Cause storin' dead niggers ain't my 
                         fuckin' business!

               Jules starts to "Jimmie" him.

                                     JIMMIE
                          I ain't through! Now don't you 
                         understand that if Bonnie comes home 
                         and finds a dead body in her house, 
                         I'm gonna get divorced. No marriage 
                         counselor, no trial separation  
                         fuckin' divorced. And I don't wanna 
                         get fuckin' divorced. The last time 
                         me an' Bonnie talked about this shit 
                         was gonna be the last time me an' 
                         Bonnie talked about this shit. Now I 
                         wanna help ya out Julie, I really 
                         do. But I ain't gonna lose my wife 
                         doin' it.

                                     JULES
                         Jimmie 

                                     JIMMIE
                          don't fuckin' Jimmie me, man, I 
                         can't be Jimmied. There's nothin' 
                         you can say that's gonna make me 
                         forget I love my wife. Now she's 
                         workin' the graveyard shift at the 
                         hospital. She'll be comin' home in 
                         less than an hour and a half. Make 
                         your phone calls, talk to your people, 
                         than get the fuck out of my house.

                                     JULES
                         That's all we want. We don't wanna 
                         fuck up your shit. We just need to 
                         call our people to bring us in.

                                     JIMMIE
                         Then I suggest you get to it. Phone's 
                         in my bedroom.

               INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S DINING ROOM  MORNING

               Marsellus Wallace sits at his dining table in a big comfy 
               robe, eating his large breakfast, while talking on the phone.

                                     MARSELLUS
                         ...well, say she comes home. Whaddya 
                         think she'll do?
                              (pause)
                         No fuckin' shit she'll freak. That 
                         ain't no kinda answer. You know 'er, 
                         I don't.  How bad, a lot or a little?

               INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM  MORNING

               Jules paces around in Jimmie's bedroom on the phone.

                                     JULES
                         You got to appreciate what an 
                         explosive element this Bonnie 
                         situation is. If she comes home from 
                         a hard day's work and finds a bunch 
                         of gangsters doin' a bunch of gangsta' 
                         shit in her kitchen, ain't no tellin' 
                         what she's apt to do.

                                     MARSELLUS
                         I've grasped that, Jules. All I'm 
                         doin' is contemplating the "ifs."

                                     JULES
                         I don't wanna hear about no 
                         motherfuckin' "ifs."What I wanna 
                         hear from your ass is: "you ain't 
                         got no problems, Jules. I'm on the 
                         motherfucker. Go back in there, chill 
                         them niggers out and wait for the 
                         cavalry, which should be comin' 
                         directly."

                                     MARSELLUS
                         You ain't got no problems, Jules. 
                         I'm on the motherfucker. Go back in 
                         there, chill them niggers out and 
                         wait for The Wolf, who should be 
                         comin' directly.

                                     JULES
                         You sendin' The Wolf?

                                     MARSELLUS
                         Feel better?

                                     JULES
                         Shit Negro, that's all you had to 
                         say.

               INT. HOTEL SUITE  MORNING

               The CAMERA looks through the bedroom doorway of a hotel suite 
               into the main area. We SEE a crap game being played on a 
               fancy crap table by GAMBLERS in tuxedos and LUCKY LADIES in 
               fancy evening gowns. The CAMERA PANS to the right revealing: 
               Sitting on a bed, phone in hand with his back to us, the 
               tuxedo-clad WINSTON WOLF aka "THE WOLF". We also see The 
               Wolf has a small notepad that he jots details in.

                                     THE WOLF
                              (into phone)
                         Is she the hysterical type?
                              (pause)
                         When she due?
                              (jotting down)
                         Give me the principals' names again?
                              (jots down)
                         Jules...

               We SEE his book. The page has written on it:

                            "1265 Riverside Drive Toluca Lake 1 body (no head) 
                            Bloody shot-up car Jules (black)"

                                     THE WOLF
                         ...Vincent... Jimmie... Bonnie...

               HE WRITES:

                   "Vincent (Dean Martin) Jimmie (house) Bonnie (9:30)"

                                     THE WOLF
                         Expect a call around 10:30. It's 
                         about thirty minutes away. I'll be 
                         there in ten.

               He hangs up. We never see his face.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               TITLE CARD OVER BLACK:

                      "NINE MINUTES AND THIRTY-SEVEN SECONDS LATER"

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. JIMMIE'S STREET  MORNING

               A silver Porsche WHIPS the corner leading to Jimmie's home, 
               in HYPER DRIVE. Easily doing 135 mph, the Porsche stops on a 
               dime in front of Jimmie's house.

               A ringed finger touches the doorbell: DING DONG.

               INT. JIMMIE'S HOUSE  MORNING

               Jimmie opens the door. We see, standing in the doorway, the 
               tuxedo-clad man. He looks down to his notebook, then up at 
               Jimmie.

                                     THE WOLF
                         You're Jimmie, right? This is your 
                         house?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Yeah.

                                     THE WOLF
                              (stick his hand out)
                         I'm Winston Wolf, I solve problems.

                                     JIMMIE
                         Good, 'cause we got one.

                                     THE WOLF
                         So I heard. May I come in?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Please do.

               In the dining room, Jules and Vincent stand up.

                                     THE WOLF
                         You must be Jules, which would make 
                         you Vincent. Let's get down to brass 
                         tacks, gentlemen. If I was informed 
                         correctly, the clock is ticking, is 
                         that right, Jimmie?

                                     JIMMIE
                         100%.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Your wife, Bonnie...
                              (refers to his pad)
                         ...comes home at 9:30 in the AM, is 
                         that correct?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Uh-huh.

                                     THE WOLF
                         I was led to believe if she comes 
                         home and finds us here, she wouldn't 
                         appreciate it none too much.

                                     JIMMIE
                         She won't at that.

                                     THE WOLF
                         That gives us forty minutes to get 
                         the fuck outta Dodge, which, if you 
                         do what I say when I say it, should 
                         by plenty. Now you got a corpse in a 
                         car, minus a head, in a garage. Take 
                         me to it.

               INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE  MORNING

               The three men hang back as The Wolf examines the car. He 
               studies the car in silence, opening the door, looking inside, 
               circling it.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Jimmie?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Yes.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I 
                         smelled some coffee in there. Would 
                         you make me a cup?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Sure, how do you take it?

                                     THE WOLF
                         Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.

               Jimmie exists. The Wolf continues his examination.

                                     THE WOLF
                         About the car, is there anything I 
                         need to know? Does it stall, does it 
                         make a lot of noise, does it smoke, 
                         is there gas in it, anything?

                                     JULES
                         Aside from how it looks, the car's 
                         cool.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Positive?  Don't get me out on the 
                         road and I find out the brake lights 
                         don't work.

                                     JULES
                         Hey man, as far as I know, the 
                         motherfucker's tip-top.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Good enough, let's go back to the 
                         kitchen.

               INT. KITCHEN  MORNING

               Jimmie hands The Wolf a cup of coffee.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Thank you, Jimmie.

               He takes a sip, then, pacing as he thinks, lays out for the 
               three men the plan of action.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Okay first thing, you two.
                              (meaning Jules and 
                              Vincent)
                         Take the body, stick it in the trunk. 
                         Now Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty 
                         domesticated house. That would lead 
                         me to believe that in the garage or 
                         under the sink, you got a bunch of 
                         cleansers and cleaners and shit like 
                         that, am I correct?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Yeah. Exactly. Under the sink.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Good. What I need you two fellas to 
                         do is take those cleaning products 
                         and clean the inside of the car. And 
                         I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast. You 
                         need to go in the backseat, scoop up 
                         all those little pieces of brain and 
                         skull. Get it out of there.  Wipe 
                         down the upholstery  now when it 
                         comes to upholstery, it don't need 
                         to be spic and span, you don't need 
                         to eat off it. Give it a good once 
                         over. What you need to take care of 
                         are the really messy parts. The pools 
                         of blood that have collected, you 
                         gotta soak that shit up.  But the 
                         windows are a different story.  Them 
                         you really clean. Get the Windex, do 
                         a good job. Now Jimmie, we need to 
                         raid your linen closet. I need 
                         blankets, I need comforters, I need 
                         quilts, I need bedspreads. The thicker 
                         the better, the darker the better. 
                         No whites, can't use 'em. We need to 
                         camouflage the interior of the car. 
                         We're gonna line the front seat and 
                         the backseat and the floor boards 
                         with quilts and blankets. If a cop 
                         stops us and starts stickin' his big 
                         snout in the car, the subterfuge 
                         won't last. But at a glance, the car 
                         will appear to be normal.  Jimmie  
                         lead the way, boys  get to work.

               The Wolf and Jimmie turn, heading for the bedroom, leaving 
               Vincent and Jules standing in the kitchen.

                                     VINCENT
                              (calling after him)
                         A "please" would be nice.

               The Wolf stops and turns around.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Come again?

                                     VINCENT
                         I said a "please" would be nice.

               The Wolf takes a step toward him.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Set is straight, Buster. I'm not 
                         here to say "please."I'm here to 
                         tell you want to do. And if self-
                         preservation is an instinct you 
                         possess, you better fuckin' do it 
                         and do it quick. I'm here to help.
                         If my help's not appreciated, lotsa 
                         luck gentlemen.

                                     JULES
                         It ain't that way, Mr. Wolf. Your 
                         help is definitely appreciated.

                                     VINCENT
                         I don't mean any disrespect. I just 
                         don't like people barkin' orders at 
                         me.

                                     THE WOLF
                         If I'm curt with you, it's because 
                         time is a factor. I think fast, I 
                         talk fast, and I need you guys to 
                         act fast if you want to get out of 
                         this. So pretty please, with sugar 
                         on top, clean the fuckin' car.

               INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM  MORNING

               Jimmie's gathering all the bedspreads, quilts and linen he 
               has.

               The Wolf is on the phone.

                                     THE WOLF
                              (into phone)
                         It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.
                              (pause)
                         White.
                              (pause)
                         Nothin', except for the mess inside.
                              (pause)
                         About twenty minutes.
                              (pause)
                         Nobody who'll be missed.
                              (pause)
                         You're a good man, Joe. See ya soon.
                              (he looks at Jimmie)
                         How we comin', Jimmie?

               Jimmie comes over with a handful of linen.

                                     JIMMIE
                         Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand 
                         somethin' 

                                     THE WOLF
                          Winston, Jimmie  please, Winston.

                                     JIMMIE
                         You gotta understand something, 
                         Winston. I want to help you guys out 
                         and all, but that's my best linen. 
                         It was a wedding present from my 
                         Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny, and 
                         they ain't with us anymore 

                                     THE WOLF
                          let me ask you a question, if you 
                         don't mind?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Sure.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Were you Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny 
                         millionaires?

                                     JIMMIE
                         No.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Well, your Uncle Marsellus is. And 
                         I'm positive if Uncle Conrad and 
                         Aunt Ginny were millionaires, they 
                         would've furnished you with a whole 
                         bedroom set, which your Uncle 
                         Marsellus is more than happy to do.
                              (takes out a roll of 
                              bills)
                         I like oak myself, that's what's in 
                         my bedroom. How 'bout you Jimmie, 
                         you an oak man?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Oak's nice.

               INT. GARAGE  MORNING

               Both Jules and Vincent are inside the car cleaning it up. 
               Vincent is in the front seat washing windows, while Jules is 
               in the backseat, picking up little pieces of skull and gobs 
               of brain.

               Both are twice as bloody as they were before.

                                     JULES
                         I will never forgive your ass for 
                         this shit. This is some fucked-up 
                         repugnant shit!

                                     VINCENT
                         Did you ever hear the philosophy 
                         that once a man admits he's wrong, 
                         he's immediately forgiven for all 
                         wrong-doings?

                                     JULES
                         Man, get outta my face with that 
                         shit! The motherfucker who said that 
                         never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces 
                         of skull with his fingers on account 
                         of your dumb ass.

                                     VINCENT
                         I got a threshold, Jules. I got a 
                         threshold for the abuse I'll take. 
                         And you're crossin' it. I'm a race 
                         car and you got me in the red. Redline 
                         7000, that's where you are. Just 
                         know, it's fuckin' dangerous to be 
                         drivin' a race car when it's in the 
                         red. It could blow.

                                     JULES
                         You're gettin' ready to blow? I'm a 
                         mushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker!  
                         Every time my fingers touch brain 
                         I'm "SUPERFLY T.N.T," I'm the "GUNS 
                         OF NAVARONE." I'm what Jimmie Walker 
                         usta talk about. In fact, what the 
                         fuck am I doin' in the back?  You're 
                         the motherfucker should be on brain 
                         detail. We're tradin'. I'm washin' 
                         windows and you're pickin' up this 
                         nigger's skull.

               INT. CHEVY NOVA  MORNING

               The interior of the car has been cleaned and lined with 
               bedspreads and quilts. Believe it or not, what looked like a 
               portable slaughterhouse can actually pass for a non-descript 
               vehicle.

               The Wolf circles the car examining it.

               Jules and Vincent stand aside, their clothes are literally a 
               bloody mess, but they do have a sense of pride in what a 
               good job they've done.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Fine job, gentlemen. We may get out 
                         of this yet.

                                     JIMMIE
                         I can't believe that's the same car.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Well, let's not start suckin' each 
                         other's dicks quite yet. Phase one 
                         is complete, clean the car, which 
                         moves us right along to phase two, 
                         clean you two.

               EXT. JIMMIE'S BACKYARD  MORNING

               Jules and Vincent stand side by side in their black suits, 
               covered in blood, in Jimmie's backyard. Jimmie holds a plastic 
               Hefty trash bag, while The Wolf holds a garden hose with one 
               of those guns nozzles attached.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Strip.

                                     VINCENT
                         All the way?

                                     THE WOLF
                         To your bare ass.

               As they follow directions, The Wolf enjoys a smoke.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Quickly gentlemen, we got about 
                         fifteen minutes before Jimmie's better-
                         half comes pulling into the driveway.

                                     JULES
                         This morning air is some chilly shit.

                                     VINCENT
                         Are you sure this is absolutely 
                         necessary?

                                     THE WOLF
                         You know what you two look like?

                                     VINCENT
                         What?

                                     THE WOLF
                         Like a couple of guys who just blew 
                         off somebody's head. Yes, strippin' 
                         off those bloody rags is absolutely 
                         necessary. Toss the clothes in Jim's 
                         garbage bag.

                                     JULES
                         Now Jimmie, don't do nothin' stupid 
                         like puttin' that out in front of 
                         your house for Elmo the garbage man 
                         to take away.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Don't worry, we're takin' it with 
                         us. Jim, the soap.

               He hands the now-naked men a bar of soap.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Okay gentlemen, you're both been to 
                         County before, I'm sure. Here it 
                         comes.

               He hits the trigger, water SHOOTS OUT, SMACKING both men.

                                     JULES
                         Goddamn, that water's fuckin' cold!

                                     THE WOLF
                         Better you than me, gentlemen.

               The two men, trembling, scrub themselves.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Don't be afraid of the soap, spread 
                         it around.

               The Wolf stops the hose, tossing it on the ground.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Towel 'em.

               Jimmie tosses them each a towel, which they rub furiously 
               across their bodies.

                                     THE WOLF
                         You're dry enough, give 'em their 
                         clothes.

               FADE UP ON:

               JULES AND VINCENT In their tee-shirts and swim trunks. They 
               look a million miles away from the black-suited, bad-asses 
               we first met.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Perfect. Perfect. We couldn't've 
                         planned this better. You guys look 
                         like... what do they look like, 
                         Jimmie?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Dorks. They look like a couple of 
                         dorks.

               The Wolf and Jimmie laugh.

                                     JULES
                         Ha ha ha. They're your clothes, 
                         motherfucker.

                                     JIMMIE
                         I guess you just gotta know how to 
                         wear them.

                                     JULES
                         Yeah, well, our asses ain't the expert 
                         on wearin' dorky shit that your is.

                                     THE WOLF
                         C'mon, gentlemen, we're laughin' and 
                         jokin' our way into prison. Don't 
                         make me beg.

               INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE  MORNING

               The garbage bag is tossed in the car trunk on top of Marvin. 
               The Wolf SLAMS is closed.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Gentlemen, let's get our rules of 
                         the road straight. We're going to a 
                         place called Monster Joe's Truck and 
                         Tow. Monster Joe and his daughter 
                         Raquel are sympathetic to out dilemma.  
                         The place is North Hollywood, so a 
                         few twist and turns aside, we'll be 
                         goin' up Hollywood Way. Now I'll 
                         drive the tainted car. Jules, you 
                         ride with me.  Vincent, you follow 
                         in my Porsche. Now if we cross the 
                         path of any John Q. Laws, nobody 
                         does a fuckin' thing 'til I do 
                         something.

                                     (TO JULES)
                         What did I say?

                                     JULES
                         Don't do shit unless 

                                     THE WOLF
                          unless what?

                                     JULES
                         Unless you do it first.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Spoken like a true prodigy.
                              (to Vincent)
                         How 'bout you, Lash Larue?  Can you 
                         keep your spurs from jingling and 
                         jangling?

                                     VINCENT
                         I'm cool, Mr. Wolf. My gun just went 
                         off, I dunno how.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Fair enough.
                              (he throws Vince his 
                              car keys)
                         I drive real fuckin' fast, so keep 
                         up. If I get my car back any different 
                         than I gave it, Monster Joe's gonna 
                         be disposing of two bodies.

               EXT. MONSTER JOE'S TRUCK AND TOW  MORNING

               Jules and Vincent wait by Winston's Porsche.

                                     JULES
                         We cool?

                                     WINSTON
                         Like it never happened.

               Jules and Vincent bump fists.

                                     WINSTON
                         Boys, this is Raquel. Someday, all 
                         this will be hers.

                                     RAQUEL
                              (to the boys)
                         Hi. You know, if they ever do "I 
                         SPY: THE MOTION PICTURE," you guys, 
                         I'd be great.  What's with the 
                         outfits. You guys going to a 
                         volleyball game?

               Winston laughs, the boys groan.

                                     WINSTON
                         I'm takin' m'lady out to breakfast. 
                         Maybe I can drop you two off. Where 
                         do you live?

                                     VINCENT
                         Redondo Beach.

                                     JULES
                         Inglewood.

               Winston grabs Jules' wrist and pantomimes like he's in a 
               "DEAD ZONE" trance.

                                     WINSTON
                              (painfully)
                         It's your future: I see... a cab 
                         ride.
                              (dropping the act)
                         Sorry guys, move out of the sticks.
                              (to Raquel)
                         Say goodbye, Raquel.

                                     RAQUEL
                         Goodbye, Raquel.

                                     WINSTON
                         I'll see you two around, and stay 
                         outta trouble, you crazy kids.

               Winston turns to leave.

                                     JULES
                         Mr. Wolf.

               He turns around.

                                     JULES
                         I was a pleasure watchin' you work.

               The Wolf smiles.

                                     WINSTON
                         Call me Winston.

               He turns and banters with Raquel as they get in the Porsche.

                                     WINSTON
                         You hear that, young lady? Respect. 
                         You could lean a lot from those two 
                         fine specimens. Respect for one's 
                         elders shows character.

                                     RAQUEL
                         I have character.

                                     WINSTON
                         Just because you are a character 
                         doesn't mean you have character.

                                     RAQUEL
                         Oh you're so funny, oh you're so 
                         funny.

               The Porsche SHOOTS OFF down the road.

               The two men left alone look at each other.

                                     JULES
                         Wanna share a cab?

                                     VINCENT
                         You know I could go for some 
                         breakfast.  Want to have breakfast 
                         with me?

                                     JULES
                         Sure.

               INT. COFFEE SHOP  MORNING

               Jules and Vincent sit at a booth. In front of Vincent is a 
               big stack of pancakes and sausages, which he eats with gusto. 
               Jules, on the other hand, just has a cup of coffee and a 
               muffin. He seems far away in thought. The Waitress pours a 
               refill for both men,

                                     VINCENT
                         Thanks a bunch.
                              (to Jules, who's 
                              nursing his coffee)
                         Want a sausage?

                                     JULES
                         Naw, I don't eat pork.

                                     VINCENT
                         Are you Jewish?

                                     JULES
                         I ain't Jewish man, I just don't dig 
                         on swine.

                                     VINCENT
                         Why not?

                                     JULES
                         They're filthy animals. I don't eat 
                         filthy animals.

                                     VINCENT
                         Sausages taste good. Pork chops taste 
                         good.

                                     JULES
                         A sewer rat may taste like pumpkin 
                         pie.  I'll never know 'cause even if 
                         it did, I wouldn't eat the filthy 
                         motherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in 
                         shit. That's a filthy animal. I don't 
                         wanna eat nothin' that ain't got 
                         enough sense to disregard its own 
                         feces.

                                     VINCENT
                         How about dogs? Dogs eat their own 
                         feces.

                                     JULES
                         I don't eat dog either.

                                     VINCENT
                         Yes, but do you consider a dog to be 
                         a filthy animal?

                                     JULES
                         I wouldn't go so far as to call a 
                         dog filthy, but they're definitely 
                         dirty. But a dog's got personality. 
                         And personality goes a long way.

                                     VINCENT
                         So by that rationale, if a pig had a 
                         better personality, he's cease to be 
                         a filthy animal?

                                     JULES
                         We'd have to be talkin' 'bout one 
                         motherfuckin' charmin' pig. It'd 
                         have to be the Cary Grant of pigs.

               The two men laugh.

                                     VINCENT
                         Good for you. Lighten up a little. 
                         You been sittin' there all quiet.

                                     JULES
                         I just been sittin' here thinkin'.

                                     VINCENT
                              (mouthful of food)
                         About what?

                                     JULES
                         The miracle we witnessed.

                                     VINCENT
                         The miracle you witnessed. I witnessed 
                         a freak occurrence.

                                     JULES
                         Do you know that a miracle is?

                                     VINCENT
                         An act of God.

                                     JULES
                         What's an act of God?

                                     VINCENT
                         I guess it's when God makes the 
                         impossible possible. And I'm sorry 
                         Jules, but I don't think what happened 
                         this morning qualifies.

                                     JULES
                         Don't you see, Vince, that shit don't 
                         matter. You're judging this thing 
                         the wrong way. It's not about what. 
                         It could be God stopped the bullets, 
                         he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found 
                         my fuckin' car keys. You don't judge 
                         shit like this based on merit. Whether 
                         or not what we experienced was an 
                         according-to-Hoyle miracle is 
                         insignificant. What is significant 
                         is I felt God's touch, God got 
                         involved.

                                     VINCENT
                         But why?

                                     JULES
                         That's what's fuckin' wit' me! I 
                         don't know why. But I can't go back 
                         to sleep.

                                     VINCENT
                         So you're serious, you're really 
                         gonna quit?

                                     JULES
                         The life, most definitely.

               Vincent takes a bite of food. Jules takes a sip of coffee In 
               the b.g., we see a PATRON call the Waitress.

                                     PATRON
                         Garcon! Coffee!

               We recognize the patron to be Pumpkin from the first scene 
               of Pumpkin and Honey Bunny.

                                     VINCENT
                         So if you're quitting the life, 
                         what'll you do?

                                     JULES
                         That's what I've been sitting here 
                         contemplating. First, I'm gonna 
                         deliver this case to Marsellus. Then, 
                         basically, I'm gonna walk the earth.

                                     VINCENT
                         What do you mean, walk the earth?

                                     JULES
                         You know, like Caine in "KUNG FU." 
                         Just walk from town to town, meet 
                         people, get in adventures.

                                     VINCENT
                         How long do you intend to walk the 
                         earth?

                                     JULES
                         Until God puts me where he want me 
                         to be.

                                     VINCENT
                         What if he never does?

                                     JULES
                         If it takes forever, I'll wait 
                         forever.

                                     VINCENT
                         So you decided to be a bum?

                                     JULES
                         I'll just be Jules, Vincent  no 
                         more, no less.

                                     VINCENT
                         No Jules, you're gonna be like those 
                         pieces of shit out there who beg for 
                         change. They walk around like a bunch 
                         of fuckin' zombies, they sleep in 
                         garbage bins, they eat what I throw 
                         away, and dogs piss on 'em. They got 
                         a word for 'em, they're called bums. 
                         And without a job, residence, or 
                         legal tender, that's what you're 
                         gonna be  a fuckin' bum!

                                     JULES
                         Look my friend, this is just where 
                         me and you differ 

                                     VINCENT
                          what happened was peculiar  no 
                         doubt about it  but it wasn't water 
                         into wine.

                                     JULES
                         All shapes and sizes, Vince.

                                     VINCENT
                         Stop fuckin' talkin' like that!

                                     JULES
                         If you find my answers frightening, 
                         Vincent, you should cease askin' 
                         scary questions.

                                     VINCENT
                         I gotta take a shit. To be continued.

               Vincent exits for the restroom.

               Jules, alone, takes a mouthful of muffin, then... Pumpkin 
               and Honey Bunny rise with guns raised.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Everybody be cool, this is a robbery!

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Any of you fuckin' pricks move and 
                         I'll execute every one of you 
                         motherfuckers!  Got that?!

               Jules looks up, not believing what he's seeing. Under the 
               table, Jules' hand goes to his .45 Automatic. He pulls it 
               out, COCKING IT.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Customers stay seated, waitresses on 
                         the floor.

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Now mean fuckin' now! Do it or die, 
                         do it or fucking die!

               Like lightning, Pumpkin moves over to the kitchen. While 
               Honey Bunny SCREAMS out threats to the PATRONS, keeping them 
               terrified.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         You Mexicans in the kitchen, get out 
                         here!  Asta luego!

               Three COOKS and two BUSBOYS come out of the kitchen.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         On the floor or I'll cook you ass, 
                         comprende?

               They comprende. The portly MANAGER speaks up.

                                     MANAGER
                         I'm the manager here, there's no 
                         problem, no problem at all 

               Pumpkin heads his way.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         You're gonna give me a problem?

               He reaches him and sticks the barrel of his gun hard in the 
               Manager's neck.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         What? You said you're gonna give me 
                         a problem?

                                     MANAGER
                         No, I'm not. I'm not gonna give you 
                         any problem!

                                     PUMPKIN
                         I don't know, Honey Bunny. He looks 
                         like the hero type to me!

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Don't take any chances. Execute him!

               The Patrons SCREAM. Jules watches all this silently, his 
               hand tightly gripping the .45 Automatic under the table.

                                     MANAGER
                         Please don't! I'm not a hero. I'm 
                         just a coffee shop manager. Take 
                         anything you want.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Tell everyone to cooperate and it'll 
                         be all over.

                                     MANAGER
                         Everybody just be calm and cooperate 
                         with them and this will be all over 
                         soon!

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Well done, now git your fuckin' ass 
                         on the ground.

               INT. COFFEE SHOP BATHROOM  MORNING

               Vincent, on the toilet, oblivious to the pandemonium outside, 
               reads his "MODESTY BLAISE" book.

               INT. COFFEE SHOP  MORNING

               Cash register drawer opens. Pumpkin stuffs the money from 
               the till in his pocket. Then walks from behind the counter 
               with a trash bag in his hand.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Okay people, I'm going to go 'round 
                         and collect your wallets. Don't talk, 
                         just toss 'em in the bag. We clear?

               Pumpkin goes around collecting wallets. Jules sits with his 
               .45 ready to spit under the table.

               Pumpkin sees Jules sitting in his booth, holding his wallet, 
               briefcase next to him. Pumpkin crosses to him, his tone more 
               respectful, him manner more on guard.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         In the bag.

               Jules DROPS his wallet in the bag. Using his gun as a pointer, 
               Pumpkin points to the briefcase.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         What's in that?

                                     JULES
                         My boss' dirty laundry.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         You boss makes you do his laundry?

                                     JULES
                         When he wants it clean.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Sounds like a shit job.

                                     JULES
                         Funny, I've been thinkin' the same 
                         thing.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Open it up.

               Jules' free hand lays palm flat on the briefcase.

                                     JULES
                         'Fraid I can't do that.

               Pumpkin is definitely surprised by his answer. He aims the 
               gun right in the middle of Jules' face and pulls back the 
               hammer.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         I didn't hear you.

                                     JULES
                         Yes, you did.

               This exchange has been kind of quiet, not everybody heard 
               it, but Honey Bunny senses something's wrong.

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         What's goin' on?

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Looks like we got a vigilante in our 
                         midst.

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Shoot 'em in the face!

                                     JULES
                         I don't mean to shatter your ego, 
                         but this ain't the first time I've 
                         had gun pointed at me.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         You don't open up that case, it's 
                         gonna be the last.

                                     MANAGER
                              (on the ground)
                         Quit causing problems, you'll get us 
                         all killed! Give 'em what you got 
                         and get 'em out of here.

                                     JULES
                         Keep your fuckin' mouth closed, fat 
                         man, this ain't any of your goddamn 
                         business!

                                     PUMPKIN
                         I'm countin' to three, and if your 
                         hand ain't off that case, I'm gonna 
                         unload right in your fuckin' face. 
                         Clear? One...

                                     PUMPKIN
                         ...two... three.

                                     JULES
                         You win.

               Jules raises his hand off the briefcase.

                                     JULES
                         It's all yours, Ringo.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Open it.

               Jules flips the locks and opens the case, revealing it to 
               Pumpkin but not to us. The same light SHINES from the case. 
               Pumpkin's expression goes to amazement. Honey Bunny, across 
               the room, can't see shit.

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         What is it? What is it?

                                     PUMPKIN
                              (softly)
                         Is that what I think it is?

               Jules nods his head: "yes."

                                     PUMPKIN
                         It's beautiful.

               Jules nods his head: "yes."

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Goddammit, what is it?

               Jules SLAMS the case closed, then sits back, as if offering 
               the case to Pumpkin. Pumpkin, one big smile, bends over to 
               pick up the case.

               Like a rattlesnake, Jules' free hand GRABS the wrist of 
               Pumpkin's gun hand, SLAMMING it on the table. His other hand 
               comes from under the table and STICKS the barrel of his .45 
               hand under Pumpkin's chin.

               Honey Bunny freaks out, waving her gun in Jules' direction.

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Let him go! Let him go! I'll blow 
                         your fuckin' head off! I'll kill ya! 
                         I'll kill ya! You're gonna die, you're 
                         gonna fuckin' die bad!

                                     JULES
                              (to Pumpkin)
                         Tell that bitch to be cool! Say, 
                         bitch be cool! Say, bitch be cool!

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Chill out, honey!

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Let him go!

                                     JULES
                              (softly)
                         Tell her it's gonna be okay.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         I'm gonna be okay.

                                     JULES
                         Promise her.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         I promise.

                                     JULES
                         Tell her to chill.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Just chill out.

                                     JULES
                         What's her name?

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Yolanda.

               Whenever Jules talks to Yolanda, he never looks at her, only 
               at Pumpkin.

                                     JULES
                              (to Yolanda)
                         So, we cool Yolanda? We ain't gonna 
                         do anything stupid, are we?

                                     YOLANDA
                              (crying)
                         Don't you hurt him.

                                     JULES
                         Nobody's gonna hurt anybody. We're 
                         gonna be like three Fonzies. And 
                         what' Fonzie like?

               No answer.

                                     JULES
                         C'mon Yolanda, what's Fonzie like?

                                     YOLANDA
                              (through tears, unsure)
                         He's cool?

                                     JULES
                         Correct-amundo! And that's what we're 
                         gonna be, we're gonna be cool.
                              (to Pumpkin)
                         Now Ringo, I'm gonna count to three 
                         and I want you to let go your gun 
                         and lay your palms flat on the table. 
                         But when you do it, do it cool. Ready?

               Pumpkin looks at him.

                                     JULES
                         One... two... three.

               Pumpkin lets go of his gun and places both hands on the table.

               Yolanda can't stand it anymore.

                                     YOLANDA
                         Okay, now let him go!

                                     JULES
                         Yolanda, I thought you were gonna be 
                         cool.  When you yell at me, it makes 
                         me nervous.  When I get nervous, I 
                         get scared. And when motherfuckers 
                         get scared, that's when motherfuckers 
                         get accidentally shot.

                                     YOLANDA
                              (more conversational)
                         Just know: you hurt him, you die.

                                     JULES
                         That seems to be the situation. Now 
                         I don't want that and you don't want 
                         that and Ringo here don't want that. 
                         So let's see what we can do.
                              (to Ringo)
                         Now this is the situation. Normally 
                         both of your asses would be dead as 
                         fuckin' fried chicken. But you 
                         happened to pull this shit while I'm 
                         in a transitional period. I don't 
                         wanna kill ya, I want to help ya. 
                         But I'm afraid I can't give you the 
                         case. It don't belong to me. Besides, 
                         I went through too much shit this 
                         morning on account of this case to 
                         just hand it over to your ass.

                                     VINCENT (O.S.)
                         What the fuck's goin' on here?

               Yolanda WHIPS her gun toward the stranger.

               Vincent, by the bathroom, has his gun out, dead-aimed at 
               Yolanda.

                                     JULES
                         It's cool, Vincent! It's cool! Don't 
                         do a goddamn thing. Yolanda, it's 
                         cool baby, nothin's changed. We're 
                         still just talkin'.
                              (to Pumpkin)
                         Tell her we're still cool.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         It's cool, Honey Bunny, we're still 
                         cool.

                                     VINCENT
                              (gun raised)
                         What the hell's goin' on, Jules?

                                     JULES
                         Nothin' I can't handle. I want you 
                         to just hang back and don't do shit 
                         unless it's absolutely necessary.

                                     VINCENT
                         Check.

                                     JULES
                         Yolanda, how we doin, baby?

                                     YOLANDA
                         I gotta go pee! I want to go home.

                                     JULES
                         Just hang in there, baby, you're 
                         doing' great, Ringo's proud of you 
                         and so am I.  It's almost over.
                              (to Pumpkin)
                         Now I want you to go in that bag and 
                         find my wallet.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Which one is it?

                                     JULES
                         It's the one that says Bad 
                         Motherfucker on it.

               Pumpkin looks in the bag and  sure enough  there's a wallet 
               with "Bad Motherfucker" embroidered on it.

                                     JULES
                         That's my bad motherfucker. Now open 
                         it up and take out the cash. How 
                         much is there?

                                     PUMPKIN
                         About fifteen hundred dollars.

                                     JULES
                         Put it in your pocket, it's yours. 
                         Now with the rest of them wallets 
                         and the register, that makes this a 
                         pretty successful little score.

                                     VINCENT
                         Jules, if you give this nimrod fifteen

                         What?

                                     JULES
                         Your life. I'm givin' you that money 
                         so I don't hafta kill your ass. You 
                         read the Bible?

                         There's a passage I got memorized. 
                         Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the 
                         righteous man is beset on all sides 
                         by the inequities of the selfish and 
                         the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is 
                         he who, in the name of charity and 
                         good will, shepherds the weak through 
                         the valley of the darkness. For he 
                         is truly his brother's keeper and 
                         the finder of lost children. And I 
                         will strike down upon thee with great 
                         vengeance and furious anger those 
                         who attempt to poison and destroy my 
                         brothers. And you will know I am the 
                         Lord when I lay my vengeance upon 
                         you." I been sayin' that shit for 
                         years.  And if you ever heard it, it 
                         meant your ass. I never really 
                         questioned what it meant. I thought 
                         it was just a coldblooded thing to 
                         say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped 
                         a cap in his ass. But I saw some 
                         shit this mornin' made me think twice. 
                         Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're 
                         the evil man. And I'm the righteous 
                         man.  And Mr. .45 here, he's the 
                         shepherd protecting my righteous ass 
                         in the valley of darkness. Or is 
                         could by you're the righteous man 
                         and I'm the shepherd and it's the 
                         world that's evil and selfish.  I'd 
                         like that. But that shit ain't the 
                         truth. The truth is you're the weak. 
                         And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But 
                         I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to 
                         be a shepherd.

               Jules lowers his gun, lying it on the table.

               Pumpkin looks at him, to the money in his hand, then to 
               Yolanda.

               She looks back.

               Grabbing the trash bag full of wallets, the two RUN out the 
               door.

               Jules, who was never risen from his seat the whole time, 
               takes a sip of coffee.

                                     JULES
                              (to himself)
                         It's cold.

               He pushes it aside.

               Vincent appears next to Jules.

                                     VINCENT
                         I think we oughta leave now.

                                     JULES
                         That's probably a good idea.

               Vincent throws some money on the table and Jules grabs the 
               briefcase.

               Then, to the amazement of the Patrons, the Waitresses, the 
               Cooks, the Bus Boys, and the Manager, these two bad-ass dudes 
                wearing UC Santa Cruz and "I'm with Stupid" tee-shirts, 
               swim trunks, thongs and packing .45 Automatics  walk out of 
               the coffee shop together without saying a word.

                                                                   FADE OUT

               FIGURE IN A SANTA CLAUS SUIT

               lies face-down in a nighttime expanse of snow. One of the 
               body's red-sleeved arms is twisted at a sickening angle. The 
               white snow beneath the figure is spreading with red.

               REVEAL EXT. SNOWY ROAD - NIGHT

               The figure in the suit lies motionless. Snowflakes drift.

               INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Dark, rustic wood, an office with broken windows and whistling 
               winter beyond. A second BODY in a Santa Claus suit lies dead 
               in the doorway.

               It's a man with a large build. The suit is riddled with holes. 
               His face is missing.

               EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               More snow falling. A handful of cars in the lot. A third 
               BODY in the same red-and-white outfit lies atop the hood of 
               an old Pontiac. His head is not visible, having smashed 
               through the windshield. His suit is charred and blackened.

               A halo of broken glass outlines him. His black boots hang 
               off the front bumper. The parking lot is silent.

               INT. ROOM - NIGHT

               A floor scattered with shiny silver quarters. Reflections of 
               neon. There's a fourth SANTA here, face-down in a red pool. 
               The suit is far too big for him. Not that it matters now.

               EXT. SNOW-FILLED RAVINE - NIGHT

               where the fifth and final Santa lies at the edge of a ravine, 
               which plummets a hundred feet down. The man rests precariously 
               atop the slope, upside-down, eyes closed.

               His burned suit is smoldering. He has a sly but tired face, 
               late-20's, sandy hair, cold and scarred. This is RUDY DUNCAN.

               He opens his eyes.

                                     RUDY (V.O.)
                         I never was much for the holidays.

                                                              CUT TO BLACK:

               THE SOUND OF A WINTER WIND

               rises, as a TITLE appears: "SEVEN DAYS BEFORE..."

               And then, to complete the sentence: "...XMAS."

               FADE IN:

               EXT. IRON MOUNTAIN STATE PRISON - DAY

               Snow drifts down onto the stone walls and wire fences of the 
               Iron Mountain, Michigan S.I.C. Winter's been here awhile.

               INT. PRISON CELL - DAY

               Rudy Duncan lies in his top bunk, staring at his ceiling -- 
               where a handful of paper-cut snowflakes have been pasted.

               The sounds of YELLING INMATES and GATES slamming shut echo 
               through the fortress. Rudy watches a spider scurry across 
               the paper snow. It's his excitement for the day.

               He turns to the wall, where there's a photo of his teenage 
               self with some co-workers at an auto body shop. And a family 
               photo, cheery Midwesterners, with Rudy a scowling Artful 
               Dodger.

               A WALL CALENDAR

               Shows the dates have been crossed off up to December 18th.

               December 22nd is circled again and again.

               Rudy muses at the calendar, then hops out of his bunk. Drops 
               to the floor, crosses to a desk, finds a chewed-on pen. 
               Turning back to the beds we reveal --

               THE LOWER BUNK

               where Rudy's cellmate, NICK MASON (32), rugged, mustached 
               and well-built, sleeps soundly. In contrast, his bed-wall is 
               a COLLAGE OF PHOTOGRAPHS, twenty, maybe thirty of them. Almost 
               a mural.

               All of them photos of A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL, mid-twenties, 
               smiling out from beaches, parties and snowy scenes. Gorgeous 
               brown hair, heartbreaking smile. Effortlessly sexy.

               RUDY

               stares at the pictures for a moment, wistful. Nick snores, 
               turns over. Rudy climbs atop his bunk again, with the pen 
               this time. And crosses December 18th off the calendar.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY

               The two of them, Nick and Rudy, shivering by the fence. Nick 
               absently whistles some "Silver Bells," then digs for a smoke.

                                     NICK
                         What's the first thing, man? What's 
                         the first thing you're gonna do?

                                     RUDY
                         Haven't thought about it.

                                     NICK
                         Hell you haven't.

                                     RUDY
                         Get to thinking about it, it won't 
                         happen.

                                     NICK
                         We walk outta here, we hit that road, 
                         what's the first thing you're gonna 
                         do.

                                     RUDY
                         Ain't there yet.

                                     NICK
                         Three days, man.

                                     RUDY
                         Not yet.

                                     NICK
                         Fuckin' Christmas, man. Fuckin, 
                         Christmas on the outs.

               Dozens of uniformed INMATES wander the yard, stamping feet, 
               hands tucked away, breath frosting. Nick tries to light his 
               cig, but the wind plays havoc. Nick curses, tosses it.

                                     RUDY
                         Hot chocolate.

                                     NICK
                         What?

                                     RUDY
                         Get a hot mug of chocolate.
                              (nods)
                         First thing I'm gonna do.

                                     NICK
                              (smiles)
                         And a slice of pecan pie, right?

                                     RUDY
                         And some pecan pie.

               Nick laughs, stares through the fence at the gates of the 
               prison's entrance road. Longingly.

                                     NICK
                         She's gonna be out there, man. Right 
                         there. Right there waiting.

                                     RUDY
                         Yeah.

                                     NICK
                         Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and 
                         right into her arms.

                                     RUDY
                         Yeah.

                                     NICK
                         Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing 
                         her own damn sheets, you read that 
                         part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves 
                         in the whole week, drinking wine, 
                         taking baths, man, see if they got 
                         those room service steaks... anything 
                         I want to do. Remember when she wrote 
                         that? Anything I want...

                                     RUDY
                         Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas.

               Nick grins. They stand there, shivering. It's freezing, but 
               the time they get outside is too precious to give up.

                                     RUDY
                         All those pictures she's sent... 
                         y'know... you sure they're all of 
                         her, Nick? You hear sometimes they 
                         don't send their real pictures. Could 
                         be her cousin or something.

               Nick studies him.

                                     NICK
                         Why you gotta say a thing like that.

                                     RUDY
                         I'm just saying.

                                     NICK
                         Why you gotta. We were gonna give 
                         you a ride someplace, man. Now I 
                         just don't know.

                                     RUDY
                         I'm just talking.

                                     NICK
                         Fuck your hot chocolate, Rudy.

               They trail off in silence. Nick looks out at the prison road 
               again. A snowy wasteland.

                                     NICK

                         as long as you're naughty, it's gonna 
                         be nice. These cold winter weeks 
                         have been killing me, Nick, as I lie 
                         here alone. It's not enough to have 
                         your warmth in my heart anymore; I 
                         need your warmth next to me. Work at

                         half of our business for the whole

                         for asking for the whole week off,"

                              (smiles)
                         Here we go. "And all that gets me 
                         through the day is to close my eyes

                         the reason for my whole entire life."

               Rudy still stares at the stone ceiling.

                                     RUDY
                         For twenty-five, she sounds pretty 
                         mature.

                                     NICK
                         Yeah. You grow up in Detroit, you 
                         get matured real quick.

               Nick's doing pushups on the floor below, smoking a cig, 
               reading sheets of pink stationery. With a new photo: of the 
               same GIRL, in a bikini by a lake. Vamping a childish pose.

                                     NICK
                         Sure as hell don't make me miss Millie 
                         Bobek. Guess I owe Millie, though. 
                         If I hadn't been rollin, her, I woulda 
                         never ended up here. And I woulda 
                         never met Ashley.
                              (studies photo)
                         That's the world for ya.

               Nick climbs off the floor, paces back to the bunks, marvelling 
               at the latest letter.

                                     RUDY
                         What if she sees you, man, sees what 
                         you look like... and it's not there.  
                         You just don't do it for her.

                                     NICK
                         Me and her got a connection.
                              (hands page to him)
                         Read this part. Read the part about 
                         stuffing her stocking.

               Nick drops the page on his stomach. Rudy sighs, picks it up, 
               brings it to his nose.

                                     RUDY
                         She's using a new perfume.

                                     NICK
                         No, I think that's just oranges. She 
                         writes here she's eating oranges.

                                     RUDY
                         Oh.

                                     NICK
                         Shoulda written to that magazine, 
                         Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here, 
                         walk right into a relationship. Not 
                         some one-nighter, man... a 
                         relationship. You? You're gonna walk 
                         outta here with bus fare. Searching 
                         for the drunkest skirt in the room.

                                     RUDY
                         Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog?

                                     NICK
                         Shoulda written, Rudy...

               Nick drops back to his bunk, pasting the new lakeside photo 
               among his collage of pictures. Admiring his pen pal:

                                     NICK
                         Shoulda got yourself a girl.

               Above, Rudy peruses the page Nick gave him. Some lipstick 
               marks pressed to the paper. He passes it back, closes his 
               eyes.

                                     RUDY
                         All I want... is to make it to Sidnaw, 
                         and sit down for Christmas dinner. 
                         Watch some ball with my old man, 
                         sleep in my old bed, and have 
                         leftovers for bout six months.

                                     NICK
                         Thought you hated Sidnaw.

                                     RUDY
                         Just taste that Christmas turkey.

                                     NICK
                         Thought you hate your old man.

                                     RUDY
                         Five years, Nicky. Five years.
                              (shrugs)
                         I just want to go home.

               There's the echo of CRASHING metal gates. Prisoners YELLING. 
               Nick smiles, still staring at his girl.

                                     NICK
                         Well, man. Me and Ashley. We'll be 
                         thinking about you.

               INT. MAIN PRISON FLOOR - DAY

               GUARDS monitor PRISONERS as they file out of their cells for 
               the afternoon meal. Rudy and Nick are motioned out by a MEAN 
               GUARD, his bitter world etched in his face. They join the 
               line.

                                     RUDY
                         Shit. Alamo's back.

               Across Broadway, a parallel line is forming. A tall, tattooed 
               Native American, THE ALAMO, steps out of his cell. His hands 
               are the size of a man's skull.

                                     NICK
                         Don't look like he missed the 
                         sunlight.

                                     RUDY
                         Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm 
                         the one ratted on him beating up 
                         Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, 
                         he thinks I got him sent to solitary.

                                     NICK
                         Aw, Rudy.

               At that moment, Alamo glances over. Finds Rudy's eyes. Rudy 
               swiftly looks away --

                                     RUDY
                         Count me outta mealtime --

               He slaps Nick an the back, heads back for their cell --

                                     MEAN GUARD
                         GET BACK IN LINE!

                                     RUDY
                         I'm not hungry, I'm gonna --

                                     MEAN GUARD
                         SHOULDA STAYED IN YOUR HOLE! GET 
                         BACK IN FUCKING LINE!

               The mean guard pulls his blackjack. Another guard's ready 
               behind him. They want Rudy to give them trouble.

               Rudy stops. Slides back into the line of prisoners. Looks 
               across Broadway. The Alamo's walked on up ahead. Rudy 
               swallows, heads toward the mess hall.

               INT. MESS HALL - DAY

               A GLOOPY SPOON of CHUNKY RED AND GREEN JELLO gets splooshed 
               on Rudy's plate. Same with Nick. It's the cafeteria line.

                                     NICK
                         What the fuck is this?

                                     UGLY STAFFER
                         Holiday jello.

                                     NICK
                         What's this shit in it?

                                     UGLY STAFFER
                         Swallow and see.

               The ugly staffer grins from under his plastic hairnet. Nick 
               looks to Rudy, then turns back to the help:

                                     NICK
                         Just so you know, this man and I are 
                         outta here in two days. So while 
                         we're inhaling London broil and 
                         lobster bisque, you're gonna still 
                         be standing here smelling up the 
                         mystery creamfuck.
                              (nods)
                         Who's in prison now?

               The ugly staffer curls his lip. Nick smiles. Rudy moves on, 
               taking his tray off the rail and turning --

               -- right into the chest of The Alamo. He looks up -- into 
               the most scarred and vengeful face a man could ever dread to 
               see. The Alamo's a lifer. Many times over.

                                     THE ALAMO
                         When you don't expect it.

                                     RUDY
                         It wasn't me, Alamo --

                                     THE ALAMO
                         That's when.

               The Alamo strides into the cafeteria line. Rudy finally takes 
               a breath, as if he's dodged death. Nick's at his shoulder. 
               They share a grave and worried look. Trying to help:

                                     NICK
                         Two days.

               INT. MESS HALL - TABLES - DAY

               Rudy and Nick sit at a cafeteria table. Beside Rudy is a 
               frail, nervous, fiftyish inmate, ZOOK. Zook sits alone, talks 
               to no one, always has the shakes.

                                     NICK
                         So maybe after our week beneath the 
                         sheets, we'll head down to Motor 
                         City for New Year's. She says her 
                         roommate's skipping town for a few 
                         days, have the place to ourselves.  
                         Remember how her brother's a truck 
                         driver down there? I'm thinking he 
                         might be able to help get me some 
                         work.

                                     RUDY
                         What, working security?

                                     NICK
                         No, I'm through with that shit. 
                         Ashley's right. Gotta start doing 
                         something I got a stake in. Get a 
                         business going.

                                     RUDY
                         I don't know, I've seen the business 
                         world.

                                     NICK
                         Hotwiring cars, Rudy, does not qualify 
                         as a small business. Chop shop 
                         consultant; doesn't work on a resume.

               Rudy shrugs. He checks across the room, on the whereabouts 
               of The Alamo. The big Indian has his back turned.

                                     NICK
                         Ashley's talking about maybe we can 
                         start something up together...

               Next to Rudy, Zook has stopped eating. He is still as stone, 
               staring at his tray.

                                     NICK
                         Whatsa matter, Zook?

               They both watch Zook put down his utensils and reach into 
               his red-and-green jello with his bare hand.

                                     RUDY
                         The hell you doing, Zookerman?

               Gloppy gelatin drips from his hand, as the frail man lifts a 
               large black cockroach out. Zook's shaking.

                                     NICK
                         Just a roach, Zook.

                                     RUDY
                         Good for you. Protein.

                                     ZOOK
                         Monsters in the gelatin...

                                     NICK
                         It's a roach, guy --

                         There are monsters...
                              (voice rising)

                         Oh, man --

               Zook stands up, holding jello aloft:

                                     ZOOK
                         THERE ARE MONSTERS IN THE GELATIN!

                                     ZOOK
                         THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN!  
                         THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN!

               A GRUMBLING MURMUR sweeps through the cafeteria as inmates 
               sift through their jello, searching for --

                                     DISTANT INMATE
                         Sonofabitch!

               He pulls something bug-like out of his dessert, holds it 
               aloft, and then HURLS it at the cafeteria line. A STAFFER 
               ducks away. The inmates LAUGH and suddenly they're all on 
               their feet --

                                     ZOOK
                         THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN!

               -- grabbing handfuls of jello and throwing it at the cafeteria 
               line. Inmates get errantly SPLASHED, and respond by wheeling 
               on their fellow inmates -- red and green globs flying to and 
               fro!

                                     GUARDS
                         SIT DOWN! SIT THE FUCK BACK DOWN!

               As GUARDS immediately rush in to restore order --

                                     NICK
                         Rudy, don't move --

                                     RUDY
                         Two days, we got two days! Don't do 
                         nothing. Don't touch nothing --

               An INMATE at the end of their table picks up their table and 
               overturns it, sending food flying. Rudy and Nick stand back, 
               hands raised in surrender. Jello HITS Rudy in the face.

                                     NICK
                         Don't move, Rudy!

                                     RUDY
                         Standing right here, man!

               Zook is still SHOUTING until a GUARD clubs him senseless 
               with a blackjack. WHISTLES are blowing. Guards SCREAM for 
               order.

                                     NICK
                              (as a GUARD eyes them)
                         Ate the jello, jello was fine!

               The guard leaves them alone, runs on. The melee's still out 
               of control. As Rudy turns --

               -- and suddenly sees The Alamo charging across the room, 
               with murderous eyes, a metal shank in his hand! Five feet 
               away!

                                     NICK
                         RUDY, LOOK OUT!

               Nick grabs him, trying to push him out of the way --

               -- and The Alamo's shank plunges deep into Nick's stomach 
               burying between his ribs. Blood splashes. Nick slumps.

                                     RUDY
                         NICK!

               The Alamo pulls the blade out with a ferocious YELL, pushes 
               Nick to the floor and spins on Rudy! Rudy blocks with a chair, 
               stumbling back, cartwheeling over a table as The Alamo roars 
               over him for the kill --

               -- and two GUARDS tackle the big Indian out of nowhere! 
               Knocking the knife away, hammering him with blackjacks. It 
               takes another three guards to keep The Alamo down.

               Rudy scrambles across the floor. Nick's on his back, blood 
               pumping freely from his gut --

                                     RUDY
                         GUARD! GUARD!

                                     NICK
                              (in shock)
                         Alamo...

                                     RUDY
                         GUARD!!!

               No one's helping, the guards nearby all subduing The Alamo. 
               Nick grabs Rudy's shirt, gasping to speak --

                                     NICK
                         Jesus, Rudy --

                                     RUDY
                         Take it, man! You're all right!  
                         Hold it in! GUARD!

                                     NICK
                         Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus...

                                     RUDY
                         GUARD!!!

                                     RUDY
                         No, man! No, no, no!

                                     NICK
                              (choking)
                         Tell her... I'll be there ...

                                     RUDY
                         You're GONNA be there! We're getting 
                         outta here! TAKE IT!

                                     NICK
                         Tell Ashley... I...

                                     RUDY
                         YOU TELL HER!

                                     NICK
                         ...be with her...

               Blood spills out Nick's mouth. His eyes go vacant.

                                     RUDY
                         NO!!!

                                     NICK
                         ...for Christmas...

                                     RUDY
                         NICK!!!

               And Rudy's suddenly hauled backwards. A trio of GUARDS 
               descend, grabbing Nick's body as his life fades away. Dragging 
               his figure out of the melee. WHISTLES are blowing.

                                     GUARDS
                         GET HIM OUT OF HERE! LOCK DOWN!

                                     RUDY
                         NICK!!!

               Rudy struggles, enraged, and gets blackjacked across the 
               skull for his trouble. He hits the jello-covered floor.

               And the world goes dark.

               INT. PRISON CELL - NIGHT

               Darkness and shadows. Rudy sits in a corner, holding his 
               head. The cell block silent for the first time.

               Bootsteps from down the row. A SHADOW falls across Rudy's 
               somber figure. It's the Mean Guard. He stares at Rudy with 
               distinct pleasure.

                                     RUDY
                         The man had two days...

                                     MEAN GUARD
                         Well. Least he won't be coming back.

               The guard grins a gold tooth. Rudy looks at him --

               -- and then springs to his feet, charges the room, grabbing 
               through the bars. The guard takes a calm step back. Keeps 
               the cruel smile.

                                     MEAN GUARD
                         You need company tonight, Rudy... 
                         you just give a holler.

               He puckers a kiss and walks on. Starts whistling "Are You 
               Lonesome Tonight?" Several shadowed VOICES request that he 
               shut the fuck up. The bootsteps and melody drift down the 
               row.

               RUDY

               turns back, starts toward his bunk. And stops. His eyes on 
               Nick's empty bed. And the wall behind.

               THE PICTURES OF ASHLEY

               Smiling, laughing, playing kissy-face. Hearts drawn on the 
               photos. All colors of stationery taped to the wall.

               RUDY

               takes a seat on Nick's bed. There's a shoebox at the foot of 
               it.

               Rudy opens it. It's filled with Ashley's letters.

               He trails a finger along them, must be over a hundred pages. 
               He selects the one nearest the front. Surveys it.

                                     NICK (V.O.)
                         Rudy, man, here we go, here, what 
                         she wrote here: "The car's waiting. 
                         The motel's waiting. And I'm waiting.  
                         I've waited for so long. I'm burning 
                         for you, Nick. My whole body. My 
                         whole heart. I'm burning for you..."

               Rudy turns to the wall. To the lakeside picture of Ashley, a 
               swimsuit siren. Rudy stares sadly.

                                     RUDY
                         He was burning for you too...

               And puts the letter away.

               CLOSE ON RUDY'S CALENDAR - NIGHT

               As his hand slashes through December 21st. Prison's over.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. IRON MOUNTAIN PRISON - DAY

               Snow swirls. Near blizzard conditions. A heavy steel door 
               BANGS open, held by an EXIT GUARD. And FIFTEEN CONVICTS, 
               make that EX-CONVICTS, trudge onto a fenced drive, covered 
               in snow.

                                     EXIT GUARD
                         Your world and welcome to it, 
                         dumbfucks! Don't be a stranger now! 
                         We'll keep the lights on for ya!

               Rudy stumbles out with the group, shivering in a Goodwill 
               hand-me-down coat. Thin canvas, wouldn't keep him warm in 
               summer.

               Secondhand shoes. No possessions.

               He clutches his sides with his hands, hunched over. All 
               fifteen huddle and herd toward the gate at the end of the 
               fenceway.

               BEYOND THE GATE

               There are a dozen FRIENDS and RELATIVES waiting. A few MEN, 
               several WOMEN, a couple KIDS. Bundled in winter coats, hats 
               and hoods. A prison shuttle bus is parked behind them.

               The released cons reach the gate, where a GATE GUARD unlocks 
               the fence to the outside world. Fifteen men are free.

               The ex-cons and relatives scan each other's faces. Wives 
               rush over to embrace their men. Pals nod to ex-cons and trade 
               slaps on backs. Reunion time.

               The snow batters them, wind whipping. Rudy keeps his head 
               down, leaning forward, keeps walking. Toward the bus. But he 
               can't help himself -- he glances up --

               TO SEE A YOUNG WOMAN

               bundled in a silver ski jacket, pink wool hat with a poofball 
               on top, scarf and mittens. Scanning the released prisoners.

               RUDY

               drops his head, looks away. Climbs onto the shuttle bus.

               INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS

               Rudy shakes his arms, basking in the vehicle's warmth. Takes 
               a seat at the back. A couple other lone ex-cons climb aboard. 
               Then the cons with relatives start to pile in.

               Rudy's window is steamed against the cold. He stares into 
               his lap, then reaches for his coat pocket. Takes out the 
               picture of Ashley, in her bikini by the lake. Stares at it.

               He rubs his window with his sleeve.

               Outside, the woman in the silver coat turns this way and 
               that, troubled. She's watching the other ex-cons climbing 
               onto the bus with their loved ones.

               The woman looks back to the prison. The guard closing the 
               gate. The steel door has been shut. No one else is coming.

               Rudy watches her sadly.

               Aboard the bus, the seats fill up. Ex-cons are feeling up 
               their wives, kids are climbing on their absent daddies, 
               buddies are jawing loudly 'bout how the neighborhood's 
               changed.

               The woman outside is now alone. Silver coat, pink poofball.

               Rudy looks at the bikini picture again.

               Then at the shivering bundle.

                                     RUDY
                         Don't do it, Rudy...

               The bus ENGINE starts up. In the seat beside Rudy, an EX-CON 
               makes out with his WIFE while his bratty KID punches his 
               leg.

               Out the window, the young woman is scanning the bus windows. 
               Then the prison again. She turns in a worried circle. Rudy 
               looks swiftly away. Closes his eyes.

                                     RUDY
                         Don't do it ...

               The bus door closes. It REVS and starts forward. Rudy sighs 
               with relief. The photo of Ashley falls to the floor.

               EXT. PRISON RELEASE GATE - CONTINUOUS

               The young woman watches the bus pull away, down the snowy 
               road. But it doesn't get fifty feet before it suddenly stops.

               The door opens. And Rudy steps out.

               The bus REVS up again and GROANS OFF into the winter.

               The young woman pushes her poofball hat out of her eyes. We 
               get a look at her face for the first time. Skin pale, lips 
               turning blue, but it's the girl from the pictures. It's 
               Ashley.

               She watches Rudy's figure trudge back toward her. Snow 
               obscuring him until he's right in front of her. Both of them 
               shivering. Both of them standing there.

               And finally:

                                     RUDY
                         You Ashley?

               Ashley nods. And Rudy sadly smiles.

                                     RUDY
                         I'm Nick.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. TRUCK STOP - DAY

               Rudy and Ashley sit at a coffee shop booth. Coats still on. 
               Big rigs bluster by on the highway outside.

               Two untouched cups of coffee sit before them.

               She's watching him in silence.

                                     RUDY
                         I like your coat.

               Ashley says nothing. Rudy looks at his own:

                                     RUDY
                         This -- this is just something they 
                         gave me at the door. Wasn't snowing 
                         when we signed up, y'know?

               Ashley nods.

                                     RUDY
                         How's your coffee?

               Ashley looks at it, like she's just realizing it's there. 
               She lifts the cup, takes a sip. Puts it down.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Good.

               Rudy nods. Silence again.

                                     RUDY
                         Gotta be ten degrees out there.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Radio said negative five.

                                     RUDY
                         Negative five?

                                     ASHLEY
                         Yeah.

                                     RUDY
                         I don't think it's negative five.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Radio said.

               Beat.

                                     RUDY
                         Wind chill. That's probably what 
                         they meant.

               Ashley nods. Rudy bites his lip.

                                     RUDY
                         I was scared. Scared you were gonna 
                         take one look at me and change your 
                         mind. Scared I was walking into 
                         heartache. All those words... you 
                         put a picture in your mind of where 
                         they come from and when you see where 
                         maybe it's not the same as your 
                         picture.

               He trails off.

                                     ASHLEY
                         I figured you walked outta there and 
                         saw me and walked right the other 
                         way --

                                     RUDY
                         No, no --

                                     ASHLEY
                         Saw my outfit or something, my coat --

                                     RUDY
                         No, hey, I like your coat --

                                     ASHLEY
                         Saw me --

                                     RUDY
                         Ashley, no. That was me, that's what 
                         I was scared of. I mean, be serious...  
                         I ain't exactly looking like Mr.  
                         Universe here.

                                     ASHLEY
                         You are to me.

               Rudy goes silent. Whoa. Ashley considers.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Thought you wrote you had a mustache.

                                     RUDY
                         I can get another one going. Y'know, 
                         hey, whatever you want me to --

                                     ASHLEY
                         No, no, no. Be like you want to be.

               Another awkward pause. Rudy picks up a milk dispenser beside 
               the coffee, puts it to his lips. It gives him a wide white 
               mustache. He stares straight-faced.

               Ashley gives a bashful smile, covers it.

                                     RUDY
                         Do that again.

                                     ASHLEY
                         What.

                                     RUDY
                         Smile.

               Ashley smiles again, blushing now.

                                     ASHLEY
                         No --

                                     RUDY
                         One more. Smile. One more.

                                     ASHLEY
                              (trying not to)
                         No, c'mon --

                                     RUDY
                         I've been dreaming about that smile, 
                         Ashley Mercer. For a long time.

               They stare across the table, drifting into one another's 
               eyes.

                                     ASHLEY
                         You're better than the picture in my 
                         mind, Nick...
                              (softly)
                         You're real.

               Outside, another truck rumbles by, whipping up snow.

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. INTERSTATE MOTEL ROOM - DAY

               And Rudy and Ashley SLAM inside, kissing passionately, limbs 
               intertwined, pawing at each other's coats. Rudy kicks the 
               door closed. Mouths devouring, hands lost in snowy hair.

               They collide with a side table, knocking over a lamp, tumbling 
               onto the lumpy bed. Rudy tears at her silver coat and sweater 
               and turtleneck and capilene and whatever else's she got on, 
               as Ashley's lips explore his neck and body. Writhing and 
               wrestling and rolling off the bed. Bang.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM - LATER

               Rudy and Ashley fuck like lovers in R-rated movies.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY - LATER

               The bed sheets lie tangled on the floor. Rudy and Ashley 
               rest naked amidst them. Her pretty young head on his chest, 
               all their inhibitions gone. Rudy strokes her arms.

                                     RUDY
                         Tell me something. This the first 
                         time you've ever done this?

                                     ASHLEY
                         Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that 
                         supposed to mean --

                                     RUDY
                         No, not that, no...
                              (laughs, kisses her)
                         I mean this, the whole thing. Start 
                         writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. 
                         Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me 
                         the truth.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Well. You're not the first guy I 
                         wrote to. But you're the only one I 
                         kept writing to.

                                     RUDY
                         Yeah. Me too.
                              (considers)
                         Why? I mean I know why for me, why I 
                         paid for the ad. But you... why start 
                         writing to some guy -- some con -- 
                         you don't even know?

               Ashley studies his face, smiles in reflection.

                                     ASHLEY
                         I told you, Nick. Remember?

                                     RUDY
                         Tell me again.

                                     ASHLEY
                         All the guys I've ever been with... 
                         they never want to know me. Who I am 
                         on the inside. They just want to qet 
                         inside. When they do, they think 
                         that means they know who I am. That 
                         I trust them. That they know me. 
                         That there's nothing left to learn.
                              (beat)
                         A guy like you, Nick -- six months 
                         before you can even touch my face. I 
                         figure a guy in that kind of bind, 
                         he's gonna hafta work to get to know 
                         me some other way.

                                     RUDY
                         Had some bad relationships, didn't 
                         you.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Not bad. Just regular.
                              (smiles)
                         You wrote me wonderful things, Nick.  
                         Personal things.

               She turns to him, kisses his chest --

                                     RUDY
                         Well, wasn't all me, y'know.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Yes it was all you --

                                     RUDY
                         Guy I was in with... he helped 
                         sometimes... some of the romantic 
                         stuff, actually... you'd like him --

                                     ASHLEY
                         I'm talking about the heart, Nick. 
                         I'm not talking about the words.

                                     RUDY
                         Y'know, some of the heart mighta 
                         been his too...

                                     ASHLEY
                         Then he shoulda signed his name.

               She turns over playfully, eases herself back atop him. Ready 
               to make up for lost time. With a kiss:

                                     ASHLEY
                         And he'd be here right now.

               INT. SHOPPING MALL - DAY

               Ashley runs through an Xmas-decorated megamall, dragging 
               Rudy behind her. Both of them laughing, as she hauls him 
               over to some cookie bakery company:

                                     RUDY
                         Where the hell are you going?

                                     ASHLEY
                         Provisions! We are not leaving that 
                         motel room again till after New 
                         Year's: we need ten days worth of 
                         provisions!
                              (to cookie matron)
                         What's good?!

                                     COOKIE MATRON
                         Oh my, we've got a special on our 
                         chocolate crunchie elves, they're 
                         shaped like little helpers --

                                     ASHLEY
                         THIS MAN... has not had a cookie in 
                         two goddamn years! Get him two of 
                         everything!

                                     RUDY
                         Ashley, Jesus --

                                     ASHLEY
                         Can't survive on our bodies alone, 
                         Nick.
                              (to cookie matron)
                         Hurry up!

                                     RUDY
                         Ash... didn't you write me that you 
                         don't eat chocolate?

                                     ASHLEY
                         Yeah, well you wrote me you were six-
                         foot-four, baby.
                              (teasing smile)
                         So don't talk to me about little 
                         white lies.

               INT. J.C. PENNEY'S DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

               Teddy bears with nightcaps, green bows, red ribbons. Ashley's 
               tearing through men's clothing racks, all love and confidence.

               Rudy's got a bunch of purchase bags weighing him down:

                                     ASHLEY
                         You need a COAT!

                                     RUDY
                         Ash, you've gotten me enough --

                                     ASHLEY
                         No boyfriend of mine is going to 
                         walk around in negative-five degree 
                         wind chill without a goddamn good-
                         looking coat!

               She pulls out a hellacious black leather fringe number.

                                     RUDY
                         Baby, c'mon, all this stuff... I 
                         haven't gotten you anything --

                                     ASHLEY
                         You got out, Nick. You're here.  
                         You're my Christmas.

               She puts the jacket against his chest, smiling. Rudy sighs.

                                     RUDY
                         It's two hundred dollars, Ash --

               She whips a Penney's card from her purse, grins wickedly:

                                     ASHLEY
                         You forget where I work?

                                     RUDY
                              (beat)
                         Beauty and fragrances.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Fifty percent off, motherfucker. Ho 
                         ho ho.

               She runs off with the jacket. Rudy turns to a dressing mirror, 
               left to stare at his reflection. An ex-con in rags, with a 
               half-dozen holiday shopping bags. To himself:

                                     RUDY
                         Just for the holidays, Nick. Then 
                         we'll tell her. We'll let her... 
                         have her holidays...

               Rudy nods till he convinces himself. Can't help but smile.

               INT. TOY STORE - DAY

               Puzzles, Barbies and dinosaurs. KIDS scurrying, PARENTS 
               chasing. Rudy and Ashley with a scared TEEN CLERK:

                                     TEEN CLERK
                         You can't find... what?

                                     ASHLEY
                         Toys for adults. Where are your toys 
                         for adults?

                                     TEEN CLERK
                         Toys for... adults?

                                     ASHLEY
                         C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? 
                         C'mon.

                                     TEEN CLERK
                         We sell children's toys --

                                     ASHLEY
                              (slams money down)
                         I got fifty dollars to spend in your 
                         store, Jesus of Nazareth. Can you 
                         help me or not?

               The clerk glances around, then, low:

                                     TEEN CLERK
                         Slinky's in aisle five, Twister's in 
                         aisle one, Moon Mud's in aisle four.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Thank you.

               INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

               CLOSE ON CONVEYOR

               As bottles of wine, vodka and rum, cartons of egg nog and 
               orange juice, and countless prepackaged sandwiches come 
               scrolling past.

                                     ASHLEY (O.S.)
                         You know what I was thinking, after 
                         our holiday hideaway? Instead of 
                         going back to Detroit, maybe we could 
                         go gambling. Y'know? Drive up to 
                         that Indian place you worked at. 
                         Wouldn't that be fun? I haven't gone 
                         gambling in forever!

               EXT. SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - DUSK

               Light snow falls. Rudy, in his new black fringe eyesore, and 
               Ashley carry grocery bags across the icy asphalt:

                                     RUDY
                         Well, I don't know about that --

                                     ASHLEY
                         Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good 
                         at. I mean, they'd give us some free 
                         games or something, wouldn't they? 
                         Since you worked there?

                                     RUDY
                         Security, Ash, I just worked security.  
                         They wouldn't be rolling out the red 
                         carpet --

                                     ASHLEY
                         And the slots, slots I'm good at 
                         too. Wouldn't that be fun?

                                     RUDY
                         We'll have more fun in Detroit.

                                     ASHLEY
                         We could live it up and --

                                     RUDY
                         Ashley. We're not going anywhere I 
                         used to work.

               It comes out too harsh. Ashley stops, a little hurt.

                                     ASHLEY
                         I just... I thought you'd have friends 
                         there...

               Rudy softens, touches her arms:

                                     RUDY
                         Hey. I been in prison for two years, 
                         Ash. Believe me. Those guys wouldn't 
                         want to see me.

               He kisses her. She nods, dismisses it, kisses back.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Well, they don't know what the hell 
                         they're missing.

               EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT

               Ashley's Chevy Nova pulls back into the lot of the roadside 
               joint. There's an artificial (silver) Christmas tree tied to 
               the roof.

               She and Rudy climb out; she heads for the office:

                                     ASHLEY
                         Baby, I'm gonna go tell 'em not to 
                         disturb us for the rest of the year. 
                         I get back in that room, you better 
                         be wearing nothing but a candy cane.

                                     RUDY
                         I'll see what I can do.

                                     ASHLEY
                         No, lover. I'll see what you can do.

               She smiles, sashays sexily away. Rudy watches her go, admiring 
               his good fortune. Then pops the trunk, collects some of their 
               shopping score. Gifts and goodies.

                                     RUDY
                              (sings, sotto)
                         I have no gifts to bring, parum-pum-
                         pum-pum. No treasures for the king, 
                         pa-rum-pum-pum-pum...

               Loaded down, he struggles to the motel room, balances bags 
               on his knee, gets the key in the door, and heads inside.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Pitch dark. Rudy fumbles his way in:

                                     RUDY
                         ...but I got a girl to be with, rum-
                         pum-pum-pum...

                                     MERLIN (O.S.)
                         Hi, Nick.

               Rudy drops the shopping bags, whirls around, as a stocky 
               black shadow, MERLIN, all 280 pounds of him, KICKS the door 
               shut --

                                     RUDY
                         What the fuck --

               -- and SWINGS a baseball bat toward Rudy's chest. Rudy gets 
               an arm down to deflect the blow, but it still stings like a 
               mother. Rudy HOWLS. Merlin comes at him again --

               -- and this time Rudy slips by. Merlin's bat SHATTERS a 
               dresser.

               Rudy grabs him by the neck, kicks out his knees and wrests 
               him to the ground. Grabs the bat --

               -- and gets DECKED from behind by another shadow, PUG, a 
               little white guy with a snarl. They go CRASHING onto the 
               bed, grappling for leverage, and then to the floor --

               -- where Rudy grabs a champagne bottle from the groceries 
               and BASHES it backwards, shattering it over Pug's head!

               Pug lets go, as Rudy scrambles up, and Merlin's got him again 
               in a bear hug. Rudy's struggling, whirling with him, crashing 
               into one wall, then another, YELLING for help --

                                     RUDY
                         HEYYY!!! IN HERE!!! HEYYY!!!

               -- until he hears the PUMP-LOAD SNAP of a shotgun.

               Rudy stops still. A lamp clicks on.

               Standing in silhouette, a figure in a leather duster holds a 
               sawed-off on him.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Welcome home, Nick.

               Another lamp comes on. Rudy, still in Merlin's choke-hold, 
               gets a look at the gunman, GABRIEL. Weathered face, stringy 
               hair, early 30's. Handsome in a scuzzy way. He's seen a lot 
               of road.

               Rudy stares, totally thrown. Pug, the little guy, bad teeth, 
               bad hair, bad skin, gets up spitting blood and champagne.

                                     PUG
                         I owe ya a drink, ya fuck --

               -- and slugs Rudy in the gut. Merlin yanks him back up. 
               Merlin's a black widebody, wears a goatee and brass knuckles. 
               Behind Merlin stands a fourth intruder, a stone-faced Indian 
               in a Grateful Dead longsleeve. JUMPY. Guarding the door.

               Gabriel's studying Rudy, up and down. Nods. Merlin relaxes 
               his choke-hold so Rudy can breathe.

                                     RUDY
                         You... you don't know me --

                                     GABRIEL
                         Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you 
                         real well.

                                     RUDY
                         No, you can't --

                                     GABRIEL
                         The hell I can't.

               As the room's door gets kicked open --

                                     ASHLEY
                         Watch out, baby! I'm bringing in the 
                         fucking tree!

               and the silver fake evergreen fills the doorway, getting 
               forced through with Ashley's grunts and groans --

                                     RUDY
                         ASHLEY!

               Merlin traps his jaw shut. The tree comes squeezing through, 
               followed by Ashley, face in branches --

                                     ASHLEY
                         I'm telling you, we got the best one 
                         in the store... I don't know why 
                         people want their houses smelling 
                         like the stupid woods...

               She's GRABBED from behind by Jumpy. Ashley screams, but he 
               slams her against the wall. The tree hits the ground.

                                     RUDY
                         NO!

                                     ASHLEY
                         NICK!

               Rudy fights to help her, but Merlin's got him. Pug locks 
               Ashley's arms. She fights, muffled cries, but Jumpy and Pug 
               have her held firmly. Her face to the wall --

                                     GABRIEL
                              (re: the silver tree)
                         Hope her taste in men's better than 
                         her taste in Christmas.

               Ashley's turned to face him. Her eyes widen. Gabriel nods.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Hey, sis. Happy holidays.

               Rudy's jaw drops. He looks to Ashley. Then to Gabriel.

               Ashley YELLS, enraged, kicking and clawing. Jumpy slams her 
               back against the wall for her trouble --

                                     GABRIEL
                         Jumpy, don't hurt her, now.

               Gabriel steps to Rudy. Studies him.

                                     GABRIEL
                         So. This is the guy you been waiting 
                         for. Man of your dreams.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Gabriel -- !

                                     GABRIEL
                              (unimpressed)
                         Must have a way with stationery.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Gabriel, what are you doing!

               Gabriel raises the sawed-off to Rudy's chest. Rudy flinches, 
               but Merlin's got him.

                                     ASHLEY
                         GABRIEL!!!

               Gabriel fixes her with a stare. She shuts up. To Rudy:

                                     GABRIEL
                         You better be here to be good to 
                         her, loverboy. 'Cause she's been 
                         good to you.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Gabriel, let him go --

                                     GABRIEL
                         Read a lot about you, Nick.

                                     ASHLEY
                         What are you doing here?!

                                     GABRIEL
                         Read you're a man of some knowledge.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Gabriel!

                                     GABRIEL
                         A man of some travels.

                                     ASHLEY
                         GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM!

               Rudy's trying to speak, voice CHOKED. Gabriel nods to Merlin, 
               who again eases his hold. Rudy coughs.

                                     RUDY
                         I'm... not... Nick...

               Gabriel frowns. Rudy turns to Ashley.

                                     RUDY
                         I'm not him. I...
                              (then to Gabriel)
                         You want something from Nick, you 
                         got the wrong guy.

                                     ASHLEY
                              (hurt)
                         Nick...

               Gabriel looks from her to him, then lowers his sawed-off, 
               and SWINGS it into Rudy's stomach. Rudy buckles. Panicked.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Who are you now.

                                     RUDY
                         You got the wrong guy! She thinks 
                         I'm Nick, I'm not!

                                     GABRIEL
                              (to Merlin)
                         Put him in the truck.

                                     RUDY
                         I was in the joint with him! I knew 
                         about him and her, okay!? I took his 
                         place!

                                     GABRIEL
                         You what...

                                     RUDY
                         I got out, Nick didn't! I pretended 
                         I was him! I knew about her letters!  
                         Jesus Christ, whatever you want from 
                         him -- I'm not Nick!
                              (to Ashley)
                         I -- I just wanted to be --

               A glance of regret amidst his desperation. Ashley stares 
               back, confused, searching his eyes.

                                     GABRIEL
                         You're not Nick Mason...

                                     RUDY
                         I shared his cell!

                                     GABRIEL
                         But you were saying you were...

                                     RUDY
                         Yes!

                                     GABRIEL
                         So you could get with my sister.

                                     RUDY
                         Yes!

                                     GABRIEL
                         So you could get down her chimney.

                                     RUDY
                         Yes!

                                     GABRIEL
                         And you think telling me that's gonna 
                         help your cause.

               Gabriel RATCHETS him across the chin with the gun butt. Rudy 
               hits the floor. Gabriel spins on Ashley, enraged:

                                     GABRIEL
                         Is this him!?

                                     ASHLEY
                              (reaches for Rudy)
                         Don't hurt him...

                                     GABRIEL
                         Is this the fucker you been writing 
                         all year!?

                                     ASHLEY
                              (reaches for Rudy)
                         Please, Gabriel, don't...

               Gabriel puts the gun to Rudy's head.

                                     GABRIEL
                         IS THIS NICK MASON!!??

                                     ASHLEY
                         YES!!!

               Gabriel doesn't shoot. Studies Rudy.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Well, he's gonna have to learn to 
                         give you some respect.

               Gabriel KICKS Rudy in the jaw. Ashley screams. Gabriel motions 
               to his boys: Jumpy and Pug drag her outside. Gabriel KICKS 
               Rudy again. Rudy lies there and takes it.

               Merlin lights a cig, examines Rudy and Ashley's grocery bags:

                                     MERLIN
                         Hey. They got a shitload of cookies.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Take 'em.

                                     MERLIN
                         How 'bout the tree? You want the 
                         tree?

                                     GABRIEL
                         Leave the tree.

               Merlin nods, tucks the bags under his arms, leaves the room.

               Gabriel drops beside Rudy, with a sick smile:

                                     GABRIEL
                         I've read your letters, motherfucker.  
                         Don't play no reindeer games with 
                         me.

               EXT. INTERSTATE - NIGHT

               As we SWOOP DOWN onto a four-lane stretch of winter highway, 
               arcing into the blackness.

               CLOSING ON an 18-wheel tractor trailer, RUMBLING onward, 
               emblazoned with "Great Lakes Trucking." There's an airbrush 
               painting on the door to the cab, of a skeleton looking thru 
               a flaming radial tire, and the legend "Motor City Monster."

               INT. GABRIEL'S RIG - CAB - NIGHT

               Gabriel at the wheel, Merlin smoking, Jumpy eating cookies. 
               A TRUCK passes; Gabriel waves. A moment later, the CB 
               crackles:

                                     PASSING DRIVER (OVER CB)
                         Hey there, Monster! What're you 
                         hauling this far north?

                                     GABRIEL
                         Hell, Bugeye. How you doin'? Ain't 
                         hauling, man, I'm up for the holidays. 
                         Gonna have myself a holiday... for a 
                         goddamn change...

               INT. GABRIEL'S RIG - TRAILER - NIGHT

               CLOSE ON RUDY

               eyes closed, dried blood, head rocking side to side. He 
               winces, waking, with the headache to end all headaches.

                                     ASHLEY (O.S.)
                         Shh, Nick, shh. They won't hurt you 
                         now. You're okay...

               Her hand strokes his face. Rudy's eyes struggle open.

               ON FULL SCENE

               They're in the back of the truck. There's some packing mats, 
               rope, two tall storage lockers, and Ashley's Chevy Nova.

               Rudy's head is in her lap. He struggles to sit up, finds his 
               wrists tied with cord. He looks at Ashley, follows her gaze.

               In a corner, Pug sits guard in a beanbag chair. He's dipping 
               chewing tobacco, reading Road & Track, headphones on. Gives 
               Rudy a bored glance, then back to his magazine.

                                     ASHLEY
                         I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't 
                         hurt you anymore.

                                     RUDY
                         Your brother...

               Ashley nods. Rudy looks around, remembering.

                                     RUDY
                         ...the truck driver...

                                     ASHLEY
                         He's not a bad person, Nick... he's 
                         not...

               From the corner, Pug spits some chaw. Ashley wheels.

                                     ASHLEY
                         You're not gonna hurt him anymore!

               Pug doesn't even look up. Still stroking Rudy's face:

                                     ASHLEY
                         Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... 
                         he's come over more and more. To the 
                         apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 
                         'member, with the tit job --

                                     RUDY
                         What the fuck is going on.

                                     ASHLEY
                         He read the letters, Nick. Some day 
                         I wasn't there. He went through my 
                         room. He found your letters.

                                     RUDY
                         What's going ON!!!

               The truck shakes.

                                     ASHLEY
                         He knows you worked in that casino.

               Rudy stares at her. She's scared

                                     RUDY
                         You motherfucker.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Nick, no --

                                     RUDY
                         You sold him out.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Nick --

                                     RUDY
                         When'd you decide to do it, Ash?  
                         After which of his letters, huh?  
                         The fortieth? The fiftieth? The 
                         first?!

                                     ASHLEY
                         Nick, what are you --

               She reaches out for him; Rudy scrambles to his knees, tumbles 
               against the opposite wall of the trailer.

                                     RUDY
                         I'M NOT NICK!
                              (raging)
                         You thought you'd fuck him over?!  
                         Well he's fucked you! I've never 
                         worked at some casino! I can't help 
                         you! Because he's not me!

                                     ASHLEY
                         Nick, I love you --

                                     RUDY
                         JESUS CHRIST!

                                     PUG
                         Watch your mouth, man. It's Christmas.

                                     RUDY
                         I'M NOT NICK!

               Ashley runs at him, wraps her arms around him tightly. He 
               tries to fight her off. She won't let go.

                                     RUDY
                         Get the hell off of me!

                                     ASHLEY
                              (hard whisper)
                         Nick, it won't work. It won't work!

               Rudy stops fighting. She has a terrified look in her eye. 
               Checks to Pug: he's watching them now, chewing slower. Ashley 
               turns them away from the little guy's view

                                     ASHLEY
                         He'll kill you.

                                     RUDY
                         You're not hearing me here --

                                     ASHLEY
                         My brother's killed people, I know 
                         he has. Truckers. If you talk him 
                         into thinking you're not you, you'll 
                         only get yourself dead.

                                     RUDY
                         He didn't "find" Nick's letters, did 
                         he.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Nick, please, it's me --

                                     RUDY
                         You told him about Nick's letters.

                                     ASHLEY
                         No, Nick, no --

                                     RUDY
                         You're in on this.

                                     ASHLEY
                         I love you!

               Rudy stares at her coldly.

                                     RUDY
                         Y'know, in a way, I'm glad it's me. 
                         'Cause you woulda broken his heart.

               Ashley stares, panicked. Pug's still watching them.

                                     RUDY
                         Your pen palls dead, lady.

                                     ASHLEY
                         If you say that, if you keep saying 
                         that, they will kill you. If they 
                         think you're not you, they will kill 
                         you. Don't you see? I know what you're 
                         doing, but it won't work!

                                     RUDY
                         Nick died for me....

                                     ASHLEY
                         I won't let him hurt you! He just 
                         wants what you know!

                                     RUDY
                              (ruefully)
                         ...maybe I die for Nick...

                                     ASHLEY
                         Just tell him what you know, Nick! 
                         That's all they want! And we'll get 
                         out of this!

               Rudy gives her a stone cold stare. Ashley crumbles, touching 
               his face, shaking her head, tears. Devastated.

                                     ASHLEY
                         He found them... I swear, Nick...
                              (helpless)
                         ...he found them...

               The truck shudders through downshifts, to a groaning stop. 
               Ashley embraces Rudy fiercely, holding on for the last.

               The trailer gate RATTLES open into the truck's roof.

               Ashley shuts her eyes.

               EXT. REST STOP/INT. GABRIEL'S RIG - CONTINUOUS

               The rig all alone at a snowy rest area. Gabriel, Merlin and 
               Jumpy climb inside as silhouette sentries. Gabriel surveys, 
               then lifts a piece of paper:

                                     GABRIEL
                         "My sweet, sexy Ashy-lashy, I have 
                         been dreaming of you constantly, and 
                         knowing you are out there makes these 
                         walls not seem so close or so strong 
                         or so cold..."
                              (to Merlin/Jumpy)
                         Women live for this stuff.
                              (reads on)
                         Dreaming 'bout your this, dreaming 
                         'bout your those, gettin' X-rated on 
                         me here, Nicky... where are we... 
                         oh, right, other side...
                              (turns paper over)
                         "Someday I'm gonna take you up by 
                         Lake S. Before I went in, before 
                         goddamn Millie, 'fore I had my 
                         situation, I used to work up at this 
                         casino, working security. Used to 
                         watch for people stealing chips, 
                         counting cards, getting piss-drunk, 
                         that kinda shit. Indian place, they 
                         hired this reject outta Vegas to run 
                         it, got about as much business sense 
                         as a buffalo patty. Anyways, it's a 
                         fun place to run some numbers and 
                         play."

               Gabriel puts the letter down.

                                     GABRIEL
                         You're a good writer, Nick. I give 
                         this writing an A-plus.

                                     RUDY
                         I never worked at no casino.

                                     ASHLEY
                              (hopeless)
                         Nick...

               Rudy steps out of her hold and stalks forward:

                                     RUDY
                         That's the guy I was in with, I did 
                         my last ten months with him. He rode 
                         a two-year bit for manslaughter -- 
                         split a guy's skull open at a bar 
                         for harassing his girl. That's Nick 
                         Mason. He worked at that casino. 
                         He's the one who wrote her letters.  
                         Me, I'm a damn mechanic, my last job 
                         was a Quickie Lube, I did five for 
                         lifting cars. I don't know shit about 
                         blackjack, I don't know shit about 
                         Indians. I'm not him.

               Gabriel stares at him. Then crumples the letter.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Bury this guy.

               Merlin and Jumpy grab Rudy and THROW him from the truck. He 
               HITS the snowy parking lot on his side, hands bound.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Gabriel, you promised!

                                     GABRIEL
                         I promised that when he helped us, 
                         we'd be gone! When he helped us!  
                         Loverboy don't want to play!

               Merlin and Jumpy drop to the snow, picking Rudy up.

                                     ASHLEY
                         You promised me!

                                     GABRIEL
                         And you promised me you'd get your 
                         sweetheart to help!

               Rudy meets eyes with Ashley. She's caught.

                                     GABRIEL
                         He'd rather die than be with you, 
                         he'd make a fucked-up boyfriend 
                         anyway.
                              (to Merlin/Jumpy)
                         Bury him all over the place.

                                     ASHLEY
                         NO!

               She charges at her brother. Gabriel grabs her, spins her 
               into control and PUNCHES her in the jaw. She goes flying out 
               of the truck. HITS the ground hard. In shock.

               Merlin and Jumpy march Rudy across the lot. A stand of dark 
               and snowy woods ahead...

                                     MERLIN
                         Beats prison, I guess.

                                     ASHLEY (O.S.)
                         NICK!!! NICK!!! NOOOOO!!!

               Rudy struggles, desperate but held firm. Jumpy loads a 
               handgun, as he muses for the very first time:

                                     JUMPY
                         The problem with prison... is that 
                         it is founded on the fundamentally 
                         flawed perception of rehabilitation 
                         through punishment. A society can't 
                         hope to create a "changed man" by 
                         surrounding him with the worst in 
                         his fellow man; what it 
                         "rehabilitates" is solely a conviction 
                         that if he can survive the inhumanity 
                         of prison, what then, can he not 
                         withstand? He has seen man's darkest 
                         soul and kept his sight: what is 
                         left for such a man? What faith? 
                         What fear?

               At the woods' edge, Jumpy gives the gun to Merlin --

                                     JUMPY
                         Don't get no blood on my boots --

               The gun goes to Rudy's head. A bullet fills the chamber. 
               Ashley SCREAMS. Rudy shuts his eyes tight and --

                                     RUDY
                         WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW!

               Merlin and Jumpy stop. Ashley stops screaming. Gabriel turns.

                                     RUDY
                         About the Tomahawk! What the hell do 
                         you want to know!

               His guards look to Gabriel. Rudy nods, sweating.

                                     RUDY
                         I spend six months writing poetry 
                         and my goddamn pen pal fucks me over. 
                         Thanks for the stamps, Ash. You want 
                         me, you got me. Whaddya want to know.

               Ashley gasps relief. Gabriel smiles.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Everything.

               Merlin and Jumpy march Rudy back. Still on the ground:

                                     ASHLEY
                         I love you... Nick, I love you...

               Rudy won't meet her eyes.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.

                                     RUDY
                         She says a lot of things.

                                     GABRIEL
                         She's getting you to help us... 'cause 
                         she knows if you don't, you're dead. 
                         You just tell us what we need to 
                         know, you two live happily ever after.  
                         My sister loves you, motherfucker, 
                         and I ain't gonna have you break her 
                         heart.

                                     RUDY
                         Wish I had a brother like you.

                                     GABRIEL
                         A girl says she loves you, you say 
                         something.

               Rudy looks at Ashley. Her eyes plead forgiveness.

                                     RUDY
                         I had better sex in prison.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Heyyy. Be nice, convict. We're gonna 
                         be working together here.
                              (to his boys)
                         Get him back in the rig.

               Merlin and Jumpy wrench Rudy backward. Ashley reaches out to 
               him, starts to speak. He looks right through her. She goes 
               silent, casts her eyes to the snow.

                                     PUG (O.S.)
                         He's not the guy, Monster.

               Everyone looks to the truck. Weasel-faced Pug has sidled 
               next to Gabriel. Spits some chaw.

               It hits Merlin's boots. Merlin growls.

                                     PUG
                         Whole time you were driving, he was 
                         telling her he's not the guy, he's 
                         not the guy. I know why he'd tell us 
                         he's not the guy. why's he telling 
                         her he's not the guy? What if he's 
                         not the guy?

               Gabriel considers, jumps off the truck. Walks to Rudy:

                                     GABRIEL
                         The man who wrote those letters loved 
                         Ashley, boys. He lived for her love.
                              (nods)
                         Let's see him live for love.

               Gabriel puts a gun under Rudy's chin. Rudy flinches.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Where's she work?

                                     RUDY
                         What?

                                     GABRIEL
                              (forces gun harder)
                         Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't 
                         she? Where's she work?

                                     RUDY
                         J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.

                                     GABRIEL
                         What's her middle name?

                                     RUDY
                              (thinking hard)
                         Samantha.

                                     GABRIEL
                         What'd they call her in high school?

                                     RUDY
                         Bam Bam.

                                     GABRIEL
                         What'd they call her in college?

                                     RUDY
                         What college.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Where'd she drop her cherry?

                                     ASHLEY
                         Gabriel!

                                     RUDY
                         Canada.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Be more specific.

                                     RUDY
                         A station wagon in Canada.

                                     GABRIEL
                         What's her greatest fear?

                                     RUDY
                         Her brother.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.

                                     RUDY
                         No. It's her brother.

               Rudy stares him down. Gabriel shrugs.

                                     GABRIEL
                         That's love.

               He puts the gun away. Ashley regains her breath.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Let's get back on the road. It's 
                         time to start talking, Nick. Time to 
                         start telling tales --

                                     RUDY
                         Nick don't talk till Nick gets 
                         something.

               Gabriel gives a challenging stare. Rudy stares right back.

               It's a showdown.

                                     RUDY
                         Hot. Chocolate.

               The trucker slowly smiles. His crew chuckles.

                                     MERLIN
                         You want that for here or to go?

                                     RUDY
                         I been in Iron Mountain for two years, 
                         truck driver. I do one more crime, 
                         I'm back there for good, so fuck you 
                         and fuck your sister and fuck your 
                         trucker friends. You want to hear 
                         about some goddamn job of mine? I 
                         want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.

               They've stopped laughing.

                                     RUDY
                         And some pecan-fucking-pie.

               INT. TRUCK STOP - NIGHT

               CLOSE ON HOT CHOCOLATE AND PECAN PIE 

               The six of them sit in a booth, Ashley leaning on Rudy's 
               shoulder apologetically. The four truckers watch him scarf 
               his pie. "White Christmas" plays over the speakers.

                                     GABRIEL
                         So when you worked there --

               Rudy raises a finger sharply. Silence. He continues eating.  
               Scrapes the last of his pie crumbs.

                                     GABRIEL
                         You knew the place --

                                     RUDY
                         Hey.

               Rudy stares hard. Gobbles the crumbs, washes it down with 
               his hot chocolate. Savors it. Sets the mug down.

                                     RUDY
                         Y'know, I could really go for some 
                         onion rings.

               Gabriel nods to Jumpy, who snaps his arm up, SMASHING his 
               knuckles into Rudy's face.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Gabriel! You said talk to him. That's 
                         all you ever said...

                                     GABRIEL
                         We're talking, aren't we?

               Rudy holds his nose. Blood trickles.

                                     GABRIEL
                         How much money's in that casino?  
                         Day-to-day.

                                     RUDY
                         I don't know.

                                     GABRIEL
                         The hell you don't.

                                     RUDY
                              (sighs, a guess)
                         Five million?

                                     GABRIEL
                         You wrote Ash that letter, you told 
                         her that story 'bout working Christmas 
                         Eve, bout how they'd send half the 
                         security guys home, nobody comin, in 
                         that night. And the rest of you got 
                         shit-faced drinking hot buttered 
                         rum. That a true story now?

                                     RUDY
                         Christmas... Eve...

                                     GABRIEL
                         You know where the guards are. You 
                         know how to get in and out. You know 
                         where the money is.
                              (nods)
                         We're taking down that casino, 
                         convict. You're the guy gonna tell 
                         us how.

               Rudy turns slightly pale.

                                     RUDY
                         Hey, it's... been two years --

                                     GABRIEL
                         We got faith in you, Nick Mason.
                              (smiles)
                         You're our inside man.

               INT. TRUCK STOP BATHROOM - NIGHT

               Rudy slams in, letting the door smack shut behind him. It's 
               a tiny windowless closet. Rudy kicks a stall door, pacing.

                                     RUDY
                         ...goddamn it, Rudy... goddamn it... 
                         goddamn girl, goddamn Nick... you're 
                         so smart, so fucking smart...

               He stalks a circle, grabs a sink, and stares at his reflection 
               in the mirror. He looks a wreck. He settles down.

                                     RUDY
                         Where's your Christmas dinner now...

               INT. TRUCK STOP - MOMENTS LATER

               A COUPLE leaves the booth behind Gabriel's crew. Pug and 
               Merlin reach over, steal their leftovers and dig in. Ashley 
               fidgets.

               Jumpy regards the garlands painted on the windows beside:

                                     JUMPY
                         I've read where the retail industry 
                         does fifty percent of its business 
                         between December 1st and December 
                         25th. Half the year's business, in 
                         one month's time. It seems to me an 
                         intelligent society would legislate 
                         a second such gift-giving holiday, 
                         create, say, a Christmas Two -- late 
                         May, early June -- to further 
                         stimulate growth and prosperity. For 
                         who would protest such a holiday? 
                         Taking the fifty percent model, a 
                         Christmas Two would grow this 
                         country's annual per capita income 
                         by close to one-third.

               Everyone stares at Jumpy.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Christmas Two.

               The Indian nods. Gabriel shakes his head.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Ever since you started night school, 
                         you been givin, me headaches, Jumpy.  
                         Headaches.
                              (to Merlin/Pug)
                         Go see what's taking him.

               INT. BATHROOM - SAME

               Rudy crouches behind the door, a piece of iron pipe in his 
               grip, ready to strike. Listening... listening...

               AS the door SLAMS open, swinging fast and BASHING him in the 
               head.

               Rudy tags the floor, drops the pipe, knocked out.

               Merlin and Pug gaze down on him, shaking their heads. Pug 
               spits tobacco. Hits Merlin's boots again.

               INT. TRUCK STOP - MOMENTS LATER

               Rudy's back, with a new facial bruise. Ashley reaches for 
               his hand; he pulls it away. Gabriel unfolds a piece of paper -- 
               it's a crude map.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Here ya go, convict. We cased the 
                         place in the fall, got the layout 
                         down. What you're gonna do is show 
                         us where each of these doors go, 
                         what the upstairs level looks like, 
                         where they got the alarms, all of 
                         it.

                                     MERLIN
                         And where they hide the real money.

               Merlin exhales some smoke in Pug's face. Pug hacks, shoves 
               him.

                                     GABRIEL
                         And Nick? If you even think about 
                         setting us up, giving us some bad 
                         information? We go down... you go 
                         down...
                              (lets it settle)
                         Now. Christmas Eve. How many guards 
                         are there gonna be?

               Rudy surveys the table. All five waiting for him. Sighs.

                                     RUDY
                         Hell. Ten?

                                     GABRIEL
                         And which of these doors here lead 
                         up to the security level?

               Gabriel passes the map across the table. Rudy stares at it.

                                     MERLIN
                         Start talking, Nick.

               Rudy's still staring.

                                     PUG
                         Start talkin

                                     RUDY
                         Who the hell made this map.

                                     GABRIEL
                         What?

                                     RUDY
                         I said, who the hell made the map?

                                     GABRIEL
                         I did.

                                     RUDY
                         This isn't the Tomahawk.

                                     GABRIEL
                         What the fuck are you talking about.

                                     RUDY
                         This is the front entrance, right?  
                         You get through the slots, you hit 
                         craps here, not blackjack. Blackjack's 
                         here to here -- lined up. What's 
                         this, the cage? Cage is over there, 
                         hard to get to, you got it all mixed 
                         around --

                                     PUG
                         That's what it looks like!

                                     RUDY
                         Since when? What the hell is this 
                         room?

                                     MERLIN
                         Buffet. Whaddya think it is?

                                     RUDY
                         Buffet is by the goddamn bar! What 
                         the hell kind of map is this?!

               Gabriel reaches across the booth, grabs Rudy's shirt, pulls 
               his face to table level:

                                     GABRIEL
                         We walked the place for a week.

                                     RUDY
                         And I worked there. For a year.

               Neither man blinks.

                                     PUG
                         Map is kinda dirty, Monster...

                                     RUDY
                         They changed the layout.

                                     GABRIEL
                         What?

               Rudy nods, pretending to be dawned upon.

                                     RUDY
                         They changed the layout -- whadda 
                         they call you? Mr. Monster? They 
                         remodeled the place. When I worked 
                         there -- listen to me -- guy that 
                         managed the joint, guy who ran it--

                                     ASHLEY
                         Jack. Jack Bangs.

                                     RUDY
                         Right, Jack Bangs. Uh... guy was 
                         always talking bout fixing the place 
                         up. Maybe get a better crowd. Musta 
                         gone and done it while I was in the 
                         Mountain.
                              (pushes map away)
                         I don't know this map, man. How the 
                         hell am I supposed to tell you what 
                         door goes where?

                                     GABRIEL
                         They wouldn't have changed the 
                         security setup.

                                     RUDY
                         When I worked there, this was Bangs, 
                         office. Back here. He kept a little 
                         safe in the... uh, the wall, money 
                         held take for himself, skim from the 
                         Indians. Called it the... uh...
                              (stumbling)
                         ...the Powwow Safe.

                                     JUMPY
                         The Powwow Safe?

                                     RUDY
                         His personal safe, he gave it a name.  
                         Now you're telling me they've taken 
                         his office, put the buffet there?  
                         Then who knows what else they changed.

               Gabriel stares at him, suspicious.

                                     GABRIEL
                         So what the hell good are you...

                                     RUDY
                         You'd have to get me inside.
                              (carefully)
                         Get inside, watch where the money's 
                         moving, see where the guards are 
                         going. Then I could work with your 
                         map.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Wrong, convict. You walk in there, 
                         they recognize you.

                                     PUG
                         So what?

                                     GABRIEL
                         They recognize him, they'll remember 
                         him after the job goes down.

                                     RUDY
                         They won't recognize me.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Why not.

                                     RUDY
                         Trust me. They won't recognize me.

                                     GABRIEL
                         We'll trust you when we're rich. Why 
                         not.

                                     RUDY
                         'Cause you're gonna get me a disguise.

               Rudy locks eyes with Gabriel.

                                     RUDY
                         I give you the wrong information, 
                         you're gonna shoot me. Well, I don't 
                         know your damn map. So you can either 
                         find a way to get me in there... or 
                         you can shoot me right now.

               A WAITRESS comes over, drops their check on the table. It 
               rests near Rudy. Rudy locks eyes with Gabriel.

               And pushes the check his way.

               EXT. SNOWY HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               The "Motor City Monster" RUMBLES along a two-lane blacktop. 
               Across barren Michigan tundra. A sign reads "You Are Now 
               Entering Powahachee Indian Lands. No Littering."

               INT. GABRIEL'S RIG - CAB - NIGHT

               Gabriel drives, with Ashley beside him. Rudy sits in the 
               sleeper, Jumpy sitting guard.

               OUT THE WINDOW

               they pass a brightly neon-lit building, with a parking lot 
               full of cars. The Tomahawk Casino, with a red neon axe 
               pointing the way.

               And a marquee which reads: "10X ODDS ON CRAPS. $5.95 PRIME 
               RIB. PERFORMING TONIGHT: DAKOTA!"

               The truck motors on by. Gabriel nods to Rudy:

                                     GABRIEL
                         Bring back some memories, Nick?

                                     RUDY
                         More than you know.

               EXT. KNIGHTS INN - NIGHT

               A Midwestern castles-and-Camelot-themed chain hotel, amidst 
               an outcrop of roadside exit civilization: fast food and gas. 
               The Great Lakes Trucking rig parked in the hotel's lot.

               INT. KNIGHTS INN - HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Faux stonemasonry and torches. "Regal" purple carpets. Gabriel 
               and his crew escort Rudy into --

               INT. HOTEL ROOM

               -- his quarters. Jumpy marches Rudy to the bed, snaps a 
               handcuff around his ankle --

                                     RUDY
                         What the hell is this? What happened 
                         to working together?

               -- and snaps the other cuff to the bedframe.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Rather be back in the Mountain?

                                     RUDY
                         Might as well be.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Don't have Weather Channel in the 
                         Mountain, Nick.

               Gabriel tosses him a TV remote. Merlin rips the room's phone 
               out of the wall, takes it. They return to the hallway.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Sleep good, loverboy. Tomorrow you 
                         got singing for your supper to do.

               The truckers leave. Rudy tugs at his ankle cuff, sighs, 
               collapses back on the bed. Ashley has remained.

               Rudy sits up, sees her.

                                     RUDY
                         Get your own room.

               She approaches instead. Sits beside. Gently:

                                     ASHLEY
                         He said he wanted to talk to you.  
                         When he found the letters... he said 
                         "when your boyfriend gets out, I 
                         wanna talk to him." I thought he 
                         meant back in Detroit. I thought he 
                         meant --

                                     RUDY
                         But you knew why. Knew why, didn't 
                         ya.

               Ashley stands her ground, guilty.

                                     ASHLEY
                         I thought we'd have a few more days.

                                     RUDY
                         For what? You to talk me into 
                         "helping"? What, he promise you a 
                         share of the winnings?

                                     ASHLEY
                         No!

                                     RUDY
                         Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at 
                         least gotten that --

                                     ASHLEY
                         Nick! He wants to know how to rob 
                         it, and he'll leave you alone! That's 
                         all he wants!
                              (breaking down)
                         I hate him, Nick... you know how...

                                     RUDY
                         So get him outta your life. Get out 
                         of Michigan. They got perfume counters 
                         in Chicago, don't they?

                                     ASHLEY
                         Not without you.

               She reaches to touch him. Rudy turns his back on her.

                                     RUDY
                         Since when do some trucker pals start 
                         thinking big, anyway?

                                     ASHLEY
                         They run routes mostly east, retail 
                         stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows 
                         some guys in New York, Miami, guys 
                         he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 
                         'em with his regular loads.

                                     RUDY
                         He working for them on this one?

                                     ASHLEY
                         No. He wants to be working for himself 
                         someday.

                                     RUDY
                         And I'm his ticket.
                              (considers)
                         What's the last place they took down?

                                     ASHLEY
                         What?

                                     RUDY
                         Gabriel and his guys. What's the 
                         last place they robbed?

               Ashley frowns.

                                     ASHLEY
                         I don't think they've ever robbed 
                         anything before. I think they've 
                         just driven guns.

               Rudy looks at her with new interest.

                                     RUDY
                         They've never done a robbery?

                                     ASHLEY
                              (shrugs)
                         They're truck drivers.

               For the first time in a long time... Rudy smiles.

                                     RUDY
                         Then they do need me, don't they.  
                         They really need me...

                                     ASHLEY
                         We're gonna get out of here, Nick.  
                         We're gonna get out of this...

                                     RUDY
                         We? What "we"...

               Rudy stares at her. The smile gone.

                                     RUDY
                         Get your own room, Ashley.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Nick...

                                     RUDY
                         Get your own room.

               Ashley pulls away, walks to the door. Turns back, wanting to 
               say something, but Rudy's not even looking her way.

                                     ASHLEY
                         If I'd told you what he wanted, you'd 
                         have been gone. You'd have gotten on 
                         that bus and stayed on it. And if 
                         that's selfish, I am. If that's lying, 
                         I'm a liar. But I been dealing with 
                         fucked-up brother and his fucked-up 
                         friends for a long time, and I was 
                         stronger than him then and I'm 
                         stronger than him now. 'Cause he 
                         showed up for money. I showed up for 
                         love.
                              (hard)
                         And if you're so ready to make me 
                         your enemy... then what did you show 
                         up for, Nick. What did you really 
                         want... with me...

               With a fiery look, she strides from the room.

               Rudy stands, can't get far cuffed to the bed. Checks the end 
               table, finds a Bible and a deck of cards.

               Out his second-floor window is a view of the rear parking 
               lot.

               Rudy watches as a Chevy Blazer parks and two drunk FISHERMEN 
               get out. The truck's bumper sticker reads "Ice Fishermen Do 
               It All Year Long."

               Rudy watches the good ol' boys stumble toward the hotel. He 
               turns back, surveys his new prison cell

                                     RUDY
                         They've never done a robbery...
                              (nods)
                         Christmas is looking up.

               INT. RUDY'S ROOM - MORNING

               The bed has been dragged to the door to the bathroom, the 
               comforter and pillow are on the floor, "Miracle on 34th St." 
               is on the TV, and Rudy lies asleep on the ground, ankle still 
               cuffed.

               Two SHADOWS fall across him.

               INT. HALLWAY - MORNING

               Rudy is brusquely dragged out by Jumpy and Merlin, passing 
               Ashley, who lies asleep in the hall, head on a pillow.

                                     MERLIN
                         Having romance problems, Romeo?

                                     RUDY
                         Not with you.

               They march him onward. Rudy glances over his shoulder at 
               Ashley.

               Who spent the night at his door.

               INT. GAME ROOM - MORNING

               A wood-panelled room adjacent to a small indoor pool, with 
               arcade games and a dart board. Gabriel's with Pug, tossing 
               darts, as Jumpy and a chain-smoking Merlin haul Rudy in.

                                     PUG
                         Goddamn, Merlin. There any part of 
                         the day you don't smoke?

                                     MERLIN
                         There anytime you don't got a mouthful 
                         of shit?

                                     PUG
                         Cancer-sucker.

                                     MERLIN
                         Acid-chewer.

               Gabriel THWAPS a dart into the board, to shut them up.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Take a look what Pug's bought for 
                         ya.

               Pug empties a shopping bag on a pinball machine. Cowboy boots, 
               spurs, a black cowboy hat, a black rhinestone jacket and a 
               longhaired wig tumbles out.

                                     RUDY
                         A cowboy. You're going to send me 
                         into an Indian casino disguised as a 
                         cowboy. Have you thought this entirely 
                         through?

                                     GABRIEL
                         Put it on.

               Merlin and Jumpy shove Rudy toward the merchandise. Gabriel 
               slams another dart into the board, then turns:

                                     GABRIEL
                         You're a country-western singer up 
                         from Nashville for the the holidays. 
                         Visiting your Grandma on the lake, 
                         driving into the Tomahawk for some 
                         scotch and slots. You only play the 
                         slots, you got that? Don't want no 
                         dealer friend of yours recognizing 
                         you, you sidle up to shoot some craps.

                                     RUDY
                         What kind of half-ass cowboy plays 
                         the slots?

                                     GABRIEL
                         You do.

                                     RUDY
                         At least gimme video poker.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Shut the fuck up. You play what your 
                         girlfriend plays. Ashley's going in 
                         with you. You talk to her, otherwise 
                         you don't talk to nobody. You walk 
                         the room as many times as you want, 
                         but the second you come out, I want 
                         to know the run of the place.

               Rudy examines his new hair and cowboy gear.

                                     RUDY
                         Do I get a country-western name?

                                     GABRIEL
                         You get recognized, convict, You get 
                         a country-western funeral.

               EXT. TOMAHAWK CASINO - DAY

               The Chevy Nova crunches into the parking lot in the shadow 
               of the gaudy neon axe.

               INT. NOVA - DAY

               Rudy's in "disguise": paste-on goatee, tinted shades and 
               black cowboy gear. Very Nashville Network.

               He's wedged between Jumpy and Merlin, wearing handcuffs. 
               Gabriel, Ashley and Pug in the back.

                                     RUDY
                         Y'know what, guys? I woke up this 
                         morning, I got a really lucky feeling 
                         going on. I mean it, I'm feeling 
                         that good. I wouldn't be surprised 
                         if I walk in there, pull a handle 
                         and hit jackpot. Hell, we wouldn't 
                         even have to --

                                     GABRIEL
                         Get out.

               EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

               Rudy stamps feet, shivering in the cold, as Merlin unlocks 
               his cuffs. Gabriel reaches to help Ashley out --

                                     ASHLEY
                         Get your goddamn hands off me --

               She edges toward Rudy, then stops. A chill still there.

                                     GABRIEL
                         You got one hour.

                                     RUDY
                         I'm gonna need some money.

               Gabriel hands a bill.

                                     RUDY
                         Ten dollars? What do I do with ten 
                         dollars?

                                     GABRIEL
                         Don't tip.

                                     RUDY
                         Monster. If we're working together 
                         here, we gotta be working together. 
                         I can't walk in there looking like 
                         the Lone Fucking Ranger with ten 
                         bucks to throw down. You don't want 
                         me getting noticed, right? Not getting 
                         noticed costs a guy at least a couple 
                         hundred.

               Gabriel glares, turns to his crew. Mutters, rubs his fingers 
               together. Merlin, Pug and Jumpy reach for their wallets, 
               grumbling. Gabriel takes a few twenties from each.

               Rudy nods thanks as Gabriel hands him the cash --

                                     GABRIEL
                              (threateningly)
                         Don't. Lose.

               Rudy pockets the wad, hooks his elbow for Ashley to slip her 
               arm through. Grins with a drawl:

                                     RUDY
                         You ready to gamble, darlin'?

               She regards him warily, but puts her arm in his.

                                     RUDY
                              (to the boys)
                         Y'all take care of my guitar.

               He tips his hat, and strides for the casino entrance. Gabriel 
               and his truckers watch them go.

                                     MERLIN
                              (grumbles)
                         Who's robbin' who here, Gabriel...

                                     GABRIEL
                         Get in there and watch 'em. Watch 
                         their every fuckin' move.

               INT. TOMAHAWK CASINO - DAY

               The cascade of JINGLING and JANGLING COINS fills the brightly 
               lit, horrendously-carpeted space. Wooden-beamed ceilings 
               suggest a rustic theme, but the neon slots, lush green tables 
               and red wheels of fortune are pure Midwest Vegas.

               The Tomahawk is tiny by Nevada standards, about the size of 
               a large bingo hall. This morning, about FIFTY GAMBLERS mill 
               about.

               Skimpily-dressed COCKTAIL WAITRESSES, most of them Powahachee 
               Indians, pimp drinks. Bored DEALERS deal.

               As the sound of slot machine payoffs suddenly go silent --

               INT. JACK BANGS' OFFICE - DAY

               CLOSE ON STEREO SYSTEM

               And some scattered cassettes, labeled "Big Winners," "Little 
               Winners," and "Medium Cash." A HAND pops the tape currently 
               in the system -- "Big, BIG Winners" and flips it over. Presses 
               play. The sounds of JINGLING and JANGLING return.

               ON FULL SCENE

               An office overlooking the casino floor through smoked glass. 
               JACK BANGS, late 50's, silver-hair, capped teeth, shark suit 
               and high blood pressure, paces his office. He's got the air 
               of a washed-up gameshow host, Wink Martindale, Peter 
               Tommarkin, one of those hacks. Right now he's all caffeine.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         There's an S-word I'd really like to 
                         throw in the discussion here, guys, 
                         cause it's a big part of what's going 
                         on. Big element, 'kay? S-word. It's 
                         a serious issue, serious factor, so 
                         I'm just gonna get it out there, 
                         throw it an out there, so we can 
                         know it, we can talk about it, we 
                         can get things done...
                              (big pause)
                         Snow. Are you with me, guys? Snow. 
                         Big time, fucking, grade-A, God-
                         quality, S-N-O-W-snow.

               Two INDIAN GOVERNORS sit before him. Business-dressed, with 
               overcoats, ponytails. One gray-haired, one jet-black.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         There's no snow in Vegas, 'kay? They 
                         don't know it, they don't want it, 
                         they got laws against the stuff. 
                         They got Egypt down there, right, 
                         they got Monte Carlo, Hawaii, they 
                         got ancient Rome, but where's the 
                         Winter Castle, right? Where's the 
                         Swiss miss Chalet? Where's the Big 
                         Fucking Igloo?

                                     YOUNG GOVERNOR
                         We understand you, Mr. Bangs.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         Capades? They don't do it. Mittens?  
                         Outlawed. Why?

                                     YOUNG GOVERNOR
                         We're aware of your position.

                                     JACK BANGS
                              (picks up a chip)
                         Because down there this is money.  
                         Up here this is heat.
                              (pleads)
                         You wanted Vegas quality, I brought 
                         it to you. You wanted Vegas press, I 
                         gave it to you. But guys, please, 
                         guys... I can't get you Vegas 
                         profits... till one of ya does some 
                         spirit dance and does something about 
                         this snow.

               The tribal governors stare him down.

                                     OLD GOVERNOR
                         We understand the Paiutes' casino 
                         saw a net profit of twelve million 
                         dollars last year.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         The Paiutes, they cook their books.

                                     OLD GOVERNOR
                         The Waitela reservation made seventeen 
                         million.

                                     JACK BANGS
                              (sobers)
                         Seventeen?

                                     OLD GOVERNOR
                         Perhaps you have researched this, 
                         Mr. Bangs. Is the snowfall on our 
                         side of the lake that much greater 
                         than the snowfall on theirs?

               Jack Bangs stares at them both. Considers his next move --

                                     JACK BANGS
                         I'm bringing in this great showroom 
                         act next week; these three Russian 
                         girls, they look like Meryl Streep, 
                         they can juggle anything.

                                     YOUNG GOVERNOR
                         Mr. Bangs.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         Guys. We're doing it right, here. 
                         $5.99 prime rib? Nobody does that in 
                         Michigan. Nobody.

                                     YOUNG GOVERNOR
                         The tribe is concerned that many of 
                         your... new ideas are not resulting 
                         in any new venues.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         I'm putting liquor in the drinks, 
                         I'm giving 10-times odds on craps, I

                                     YOUNG GOVERNOR
                         We want to see our casino making 
                         money again, Mr. Bangs. Making money 
                         for our community.

                                     OLD GOVERNOR
                         Like the Paiutes and the Waitela.

               The young man stands, stares Jack Bangs in the eye.

                                     YOUNG GOVERNOR
                         We want you doing the job... that we 
                         brought you here to do.

               INT. TOMAHAWK - DAY

               Rudy and Ashley move away from a change booth, with a bucket 
               of quarters. Rudy messes with his cowboy getup, noting two 
               SECURITY GUARDS punch a code in a private door, step inside:

                                     ASHLEY
                         So does it look a lot different?

                                     RUDY
                         Here and there. Restaurant, uh, that's 
                         the main expansion. Tables've been 
                         moved around; the big man's office, 
                         I dunno, might be upstairs now.

               They settle at a slot machine. Another SECURITY GUARD walks 
               past them. Rudy turns his back. Ashley notices.

                                     ASHLEY
                         That guy knows you?

                                     RUDY
                         Yeah, uh. Mike. That's Mike.

               At the door, Merlin and Jumpy enter, wandering through the 
               slots.

               Rudy sees them.

                                     RUDY
                         You start spending your brother's 
                         money. I'm gonna take a circuit around 
                         the joint, check for any new ins and 
                         outs. I'll snag us some drinks.

               As he strides away --

                                     ASHLEY
                              (sotto)
                         Be careful, Nick...

               MOVING THROUGH THE CASINO

               with Rudy, ambling among the tables, making a show of checking 
               out the layout. In reality, he's surveying the GAMBLERS.

               Passing the cage, he walks right by Jack Bangs and the Indian 
               governors. Jack Bangs is all smiles, while the governors 
               turn their backs an him and storm out.

               ARRIVING AT THE BAR

                                     RUDY
                         Couple rum and Cokes, please.

                                     INDIAN BARTENDER
                         You want that rum and Coke or rum 
                         and Pepsi?

               Rudy gives him a strange look. The bartender shrugs. Rudy 
               still scans the tables, settling on --

               A BLACKJACK TABLE

               where a trio of COLLEGE KIDS are forking over chips. One of 
               them's dark-haired with a goatee, a sweatshirt and jeans. 
               Rudy studies this kid for moment.

                                     JACK BANGS (O.S.)
                         Gimme a goddamn bottle of anything.

               BACK AT THE BAR

               Jack Bangs sidles up, distraught. The barkeep hands him a 
               bottle. Bangs takes a swig.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         I can't go back to Vegas, Bear. 
                         They'll fuckin' kill me, 'kay? I 
                         can't go back...

                                     BARTENDER
                         What does the tribe want?

                                     JACK BANGS
                         They want gold-paved roads is what 
                         they want. Talking 'bout the fuckin' 
                         Paiutes. Fuckin' Paiutes are on the 
                         interstate. Nothing I can do about 
                         that, man, I didn't pick the spot 
                         for your reservation.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Neither did we.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         Yeah, yeah, whatever.

               Rudy gets his drinks, as Jack Bangs turns his way:

                                     JACK BANGS
                         Hey. Hey, cowboy. Jack Bangs, I run 
                         the place. Nice to have you in the 
                         Tomahawk. Tell me something...

               Rudy winces, glancing to see Merlin and Jumpy watching him. 
               Frowns on their faces.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         ...does upstate Michigan need another 
                         roadside casino or does upstate 
                         Michigan need an international gaming 
                         destination?

                                     RUDY
                              (wants outta here)
                         Roadside casino?

               Jack Bangs, smile falls flat.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         Well, so how'd you hear about this 
                         place, then. Word-of-mouth? Mass 
                         mailings? Cable TV?

                                     RUDY
                         Prison.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         Prison?!

               Rudy shrugs, smiles, takes off with his drinks. Bangs looks 
               sick, turns to a FAT GUY on the next stool over. But before 
               he can ask, the guy shakes his head --

                                     FAT GUY
                         I just stopped in to use the can.

               Bangs turns to the bartender, puts his head in his hands:

                                     JACK BANGS
                         I can't go back to Vegas, Bear... I 
                         can't...

               From the slots, we hear a JACKPOT PAYOFF.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         Aw fuck.

               THROUGH THE TABLES

               walks Rudy, as Merlin sidles up next to him:

                                     MERLIN
                         What the hell was that about --

                                     RUDY
                         He didn't recognize me. Back off, 
                         willya? He didn't recognize me.

               Merlin eyes him darkly, but lets him walk on into the slots. 
               As he nears Ashley, he glances to the blackjack table, where 
               the College Kid has left... heading for the bathroom --

                                     ASHLEY
                         Hey Nick! We're up fifty cents!

               -- and as a barely-dressed COCKTAIL WAITRESS crosses between 
               Rudy and Ashley, blocking her view of him --

               Rudy pretends to crash into her, splashing the rum and Coke 
               into his own face --

                                     RUDY
                         Heyyyy!

               Reaching Ashley, his goatee is dripping --

                                     ASHLEY
                         Nick, what happened --

                                     RUDY
                         There went my... damn... well, doesn't 
                         seem like security's all that 
                         switched... Ash, shit, this mustache 
                         is starting to fall off. I gotta fix 
                         this thing --
                              (hands her his glass)
                         -- drink this for me.

               He hustles for the bathroom. A moment later, Jumpy storms 
               by.

               Stops at Ashley.

                                     JUMPY
                         What happened?

                                     ASHLEY
                         He started losing his hair.

               INT. CASINO BATHROOM - DAY

               The College Kid is zipping up when Rudy SLAMS into his back, 
               money in hand, crashing him against the wall:

                                     RUDY
                         Hundred bucks to wear this jacket --

                                     COLLEGE KID
                         Jesus, man, don't kill me!

                                     RUDY
                         Nobody's killing you, kid. Santa's 
                         giving you a rhinestone jacket and a 
                         hundred bucks.

               INT. TOMAHAWK SAME

               Merlin's at a slot machine, watching the hall to the 
               bathrooms. A WAITRESS arrives, hands him a beer:

                                     MERLIN
                         Thanks, sister. How are ya.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Fuckin' freezing.

                                     MERLIN
                         Hell yeah. You work here long?

                                     WAITRESS
                         Five years. Since it opened.

                                     MERLIN
                         How long ago was your makeover?

                                     WAITRESS
                         My what?!

                                     MERLIN
                         No, the place. The remodeling. moving 
                         everything around.

               The waitress frowns.

                                     WAITRESS
                         The Tomahawk's looked the same since 
                         I started, mister.
                              (shrugs)
                         Only the losers change.

               Merlin stares at her. Then drops his drink to the floor, 
               charging for the bathroom.

               INT. BATHROOM

               As Merlin crashes in, seeing the cowboy hat and jacket, back 
               turned, adjusting a belt. As the figure turns around.

               It's the College Kid. Merlin stops in his tracks --

               -- as Rudy CRASHES into him from a stall, kicking his legs 
               out, driving his throat into a countertop. Merlin hits the 
               ground, gagging. Rudy wears the kid's sweatshirt:

                                     RUDY
                         GO! GO!

               The College Kid, shaking, hustles out the door.

               INT. TOMAHAWK - CONTINUOUS

               As the College Kid, in Rudy's black getup, strides out of 
               the bathroom hall, walking for the casino exit.

               From the slots, Ashley and Jumpy glance up, seeing him go. 
               From their vantage, it looks like Rudy. They frown.

               As they're watching the Kid hit the door, Rudy darts out of 
               the hall, heads the other way.

               EXT. PARKING LOT/INT. NOVA

               Gabriel and Pug sit sentry, seeing the cowboy figure leave 
               the casino. wandering into-the parking lot... away from them.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Where the hell's he going?

                                     PUG
                         Where the hell's your sister?

               As the figure unlocks the driver's door of a Trans Am --

                                     GABRIEL
                         Get him!

               Pug REVS the engine, speeds through the lot, cutting off the 
               Trans Am from backing away.

               Gabriel jumps out, HAULS the cowboy from his car and sees 
               it's the College Kid. Rudy's gone.

                                     COLLEGE KID
                              (scared shitless)
                         Oh man. It's your jacket, isn't it...

               INT. TOMAHAWK

               Merlin stumbles out of the bathroom, holding his throat. 
               Catches Jumpy and Ashley's eyes from the slots:

                                     JUMPY
                         Trouble.

               INT. CASINO KITCHEN

               As Rudy charges toward COOKS, holding a buffet plate aloft --

                                     RUDY
                         MEDIUM RARE?! You call this MEDIUM 
                         RARE??!!

               -- hands them the plate, hurries past them, and out the --

               EXT. REAR OF CASINO - DAY

               -- to the back of the building. In his stolen clothes, he 
               charges across the staff parking area and into the snowy 
               expanse of meadow beyond.

               Running for a thicket of winter woods.

               EXT. PARKING LOT

               Merlin and Jumpy stride out to join Gabriel and Pug. Ashley 
               follows, stumbling to keep up.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Where the HELL did he go?

                         Monster. There never was a structure 
                         change. This place was built the 
                         same from day one.

                                     PUG
                         That motherfucker --

                                     MERLIN
                         And Monster... he was talking with 
                         the casino manager. Nick was talking 
                         to him.

               Gabriel darkens.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Get. Him. Back.

               EXT. SNOWY MEADOW - DAY

               Rudy races as best he can through the waves of snow. He keeps 
               struggling, losing his footing, fighting his way toward the 
               cover of trees. From far away...

                                     ASHLEY (O.S.)
                         Nick! Run! RUN!!!

               Rudy turns back to see Merlin, Jumpy and Pug round into view 
               back at the parking lot. They see him.

               And charge into the snowfield.

               Rudy breaks into the trees.

               EXT. PARKING LOT

               Gabriel pushes Ashley into the Nova and peals out of the 
               parking lot. Onto reservation roads.

               EXT. WOODS - ON CHASE - DAY

               Rudy darts among barren oaks and brush pines, crunching deeper 
               into snowdrifts, slowing him down. Stumbling forward, 
               shivering, breath frosting --

               -- as Merlin, Jumpy and Pug reach the treeline. Gaining but 
               struggling too. With guns held.

               Rudy keeps battling through the drifts --

               -- as GUNSHOTS start to ring out. Rudy glances back to rest; 
               the truckers are a hundred yards distant. But as he turns to 
               struggle on, treebark SPLITS apart beside him.

               Rudy keeps running.

               INT. NOVA

               Bouncing over a snowy dirt road, having found a shortcut 
               into the woods. Gabriel searches the trees, Ashley too.

               EXT. WOODS

               Merlin, Jumpy and Pug keep up their steady march. Rudy's 
               running figure now only fifty yards distant.

                                     MERLIN
                         You keep running, Nick! Keep running 
                         now! Can't keep warm if you don't 
                         keep running! We'll just be right 
                         back here... keeping track of your 
                         trail.

               ANGLE to show Merlin's striding right in Rudy's bootprints. 
               Pug FIRES off two shots.

               They KICK UP snow just behind Rudy, struggling, panting...

                                     MERLIN (O.S.)
                         Wherever you run... we'll get there. 
                         Fast as you want... we'll be there.  
                         We drive for a living, Nick. Twelve, 
                         fifteen, twenty-hour days.

               Rudy's anguished, ducking behind some pines, trying to brush 
               away his footprints. Realizes it's useless.

               A BULLET whistles through the pine branches.

                                     MERLIN (O.S.)
                         We got nothing but time.

               Rudy takes a breath, crashes onward --

               -- then stops at the sound of a RUMBLING. Getting louder. 
               Closer. It's a car's engine.

               Rudy spins for the source, focuses, and manages to make out 
               a snow-covered dirt road fifty yards away, down a swale. 
               Another BULLET smashes treebark. Rudy runs for it.

               EXT. WOODED ROAD - DAY

               As Rudy leaps out to wave down the car, as around the corner 
               comes a Chevy Nova --

               -- with Gabriel and Ashley inside. Gabriel's eyes widen, he 
               floors the gas, RACING right for Rudy.

               Rudy scampers toward the opposite roadside, a steep wooded 
               slope cradling a meadow and frozen river --

                                     ASHLEY
                         No!!!

               -- as Ashley grabs Gabriel's steering wheel, swerving the 
               other way. Gabriel fights her for control --

               -- as the Nova just misses Rudy, who dives off the road, 
               hits the slope and tumbles head-over-heels toward its bottom, 
               a hundred feet down, kicking up geysers of snow!

               On the road, the Nova skids to a stop. Ashley and Gabriel 
               leap out, as Merlin, Jumpy and Pug reach the road.

               AT THE SLOPE'S BOTTOM

               Rudy pops to his feet, a dazed snowball.

               BACK UP AT THE ROAD

               Gabriel grabs a rifle from the Nova, steps to the slope-top 
               edge and takes aim --

                                     ASHLEY
                         RUN!!!

               -- as Ashley suddenly slams into him from behind --

               Sending the both of them tumbling down the slope! Sliding 
               and tangled, the rifle flying from Gabriel's grasp --

               TO THE BOTTOM

               -- where they come to a tangled, snowy halt. Gabriel struggles 
               to clear the ice from his face --

               -- as the butt of his rifle cracks him in the jaw.

                                     RUDY
                         That's for reading her mail.

               He extends a hand to Ashley --

                                     RUDY
                         Come on.

               -- and hauls her to her feet. Ashley beams. As Gabriel howls, 
               the two of them scramble away from the woods, Rudy with the 
               rifle, toward the meadow and its frozen pond.

               More GUNSHOTS ring as Merlin, Jumpy and Pug slide their way 
               down the ravine.

               EXT. FROZEN RIVER - CONTINUOUS

               Rudy and Ashley race out across the ice. The traction's 
               slippery, but there's no way around. There's a highway bridge 
               two hundred yards away, with sparse truck traffic.

                                     RUDY
                         We get to the bridge, we're all right!

                                     ASHLEY
                         Nick, the ice is --

                                     RUDY
                         Get to the bridge!
                              (waving at traffic)
                         HEY! HEY! DOWN HERE!

               He grips her hand tighter, as SHOTS crash into the ice at 
               their feet. Suddenly, the ground splinters and gives way --

               -- and Ashley goes plummeting through to the river! She 
               vanishes from sight in an instant!

               Rudy scrambles back, onto sturdy ice. He stares, stunned, at 
               the ripples in the freezing water.

               Ashley's not coming up.

               RUDY

               Looks to the truckers in pursuit. Coming down the ridge.

               Then the highway. Safety within sight.

               But he can't run. Cursing himself, he grips the rifle tightly 
               and LEAPS into the ice-hole --

               EXT. RIVER BENEATH THE ICE

               -- plummeting underwater, the temperature hitting his body 
               like needles. He writhes, spinning around --

               -- and sees Ashley ten yards away, desperately pounding at 
               the ice above her. Strength giving out.

               Rudy struggles to her, wrapping an arm around her. She fights, 
               panicked, clawing at the ice, both of them pulled further 
               away from the opening.

               With Ashley safely in hand, Rudy raises his rifle-arm, 
               pressing the barrel against the ice above them --

               -- and FIRES. A HOLE blasts a shaft of light into the gray-
               blue. Rudy FIRES again. Another HOLE caves in. Ashley reaches 
               for a sheath of ice, splashing --

               TO THE SURFACE

               -- clutching frozen ground, treading water. Rudy surfaces 
               beside her, the both of them gasping, facing the bridge.

               Instinctively, they spin around --

               TO FIND GABRIEL, MERLIN, JUMPY AND PUG

               -- standing right behind them. Guns trained.

                                     GABRIEL
                              (rubs his jaw)
                         At the rate you're going, Nick...  
                         I'm gonna have a hard time ever 
                         considering you family.

               He extends his hand, a gesture of help. But menacing.

                                     GABRIEL
                         How lucky ya feeling now.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GABRIEL'S RIG - DAY

               Pitch black. We can barely make out a huddled, fetal form, 
               quaking and trembling. It's Rudy. Dripping wet, on the verge 
               of hypothermia. Trying to stay conscious:

                                     RUDY
                         I-I-I-I have n-n-no g-g-gifts to br-
                         br-bring, pa rum-p-p-p-p-p
                              (struggling)
                         ...pum-pum-pum. N-n-no treasures for 
                         the k-k-k
                              (waits)
                         ...king.

               The trailer doors swing open, crashing harsh light upon him. 
               He squints into the light, shivering madly.

                                     RUDY
                         Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum.

               INT. KNIGHTS INN GAME ROOM - DAY

               Gabriel is hurling darts again, focused, expressionless. 
               Bullseye.

               Merlin and Jumpy haul Rudy in. He collapses at Gabriel's 
               feet, unable to stand. Still trembling.

               A couple KIDS scamper into the doorway --

                                     MERLIN
                         Game room's closed.

               -- and Merlin slams the door in their face. Gabriel hurls 
               another bullseye, then retrieves his darts from the board.

                                     GABRIEL
                         A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for 
                         effort and an honorary degree. I'm 
                         surprised you never escaped from the 
                         Mountain.

                                     RUDY
                              (teeth chattering)
                         ...never... tried...

                                     GABRIEL
                         Nick, here's what we're gonna do. In 
                         the spirit of the season, I'm going 
                         to give you a chance. I understand 
                         you're unhappy. Right outta the 
                         lockup, here against your will, it's 
                         the holidays and there's reruns on 
                         TV.
                              (beat)
                         So we're gonna have a contest.

               Gabriel strides back to him, with two darts.

                                     GABRIEL
                         We're each going to get one of these. 
                         Whichever one of us hits closer to 
                         the bullseye... gets what he wants.
                              (beat)
                         You land closer, you get Ashley.  
                         And you guys get to go free. I land 
                         closer... and we start getting your 
                         help.

               He lifts Rudy's shaking hand, puts a dart in it. Rudy's 
               fingers are half-frozen, they don't bend. Gabriel has to 
               wedge it in.

                                     GABRIEL
                         May the best sportsman win.

               Gabriel turns to the board, ten feet away, and tosses his 
               dart. It thunks in the "13" wedge of the outermost ring.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Damn.

               He steps aside for Rudy. Rudy struggles to raise his hand, 
               trembling badly. He focuses on the board, teeth chattering, 
               tries to reposition his fingers, rears back and throws --

               -- except the dart remains in his frozen grip. He brings his 
               icy hand back, tries to move his fingers. And the dart finally 
               tumbles out and hits the floor at his feet.

               Gabriel smiles, steps close.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Got something to say to me, Nick?

                                     RUDY
                         ...ttt..tt... two out of three?

               Gabriel grabs his jacket and hurls him backward. Rudy CRASHES 
               into a chair, flanked by video games.

                                     GABRIEL
                         What'd you tell that casino manager?

                                     RUDY
                         Nnn... nothing...

                                     GABRIEL
                         You were talking to him! What'd you 
                         tell him!?

                                     RUDY
                         Nothing... I promise-nothing...

                                     GABRIEL
                         MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?

                                     RUDY
                         NO!

               Gabriel spins to the dartboard, pulls out a fistful and 
               wheels. He whistles a dart at Rudy's head. it SMACKS the 
               wall beside his ear.

               He whistles another. It TRUNKS right above his head. A third 
               HITS the wall by his chin.

                                     RUDY
                         He thought I was some gambler... he 
                         didn't know me... he didn't recognize 
                         me!

                                     GABRIEL
                         I been driving rigs a long time, 
                         Nick. Four, five million miles of 
                         road. Worked for people who wouldn't 
                         keep me on less I was driving fifteen 
                         hours a day. Tell 'em I needed sleep, 
                         I needed rest, shit, they'll hire 
                         someone else...

               Gabriel flings another dart. Just misses Rudy's other ear.

                                     GABRIEL
                         ...Dispatcher's screaming for me to 
                         haul ass, he's got a load on the 
                         runback for me. Shipper's making me 
                         wait for the pickup, receiver's 
                         bitching 'bout the count...

               Another dart NAILS the wall, right through Rudy's hair.

                                     GABRIEL
                         ...Got the cops at the bottom of 
                         every mountain, got the DOT at the 
                         top. And every day, every day, I see 
                         all those faces in their little airbag 
                         Hot Wheels, moms and pops and jam-
                         faced kiddies, giving me that look 
                         to go to hell and get off their happy 
                         goddamn highway. Hey. They don't 
                         gotta get two thousand miles by 
                         sundown, or the gang don't eat come 
                         sunrise.

               Gabriel strides to Rudy, sitting stock-still, his head ringed 
               by darts. Stares him down.

                                     GABRIEL
                         It's time for me... to be working 
                         for me. I want mine, Nick. And I 
                         need you.
                              (frightening calm)
                         Did you tell your manager there's 
                         gonna be a robbery?

                                     RUDY
                         No, Gabriel... no...

               Gabriel pulls the darts free. Backs away again.

                                     RUDY
                         ...he... he asked me... how I'd heard 
                         about his place... he didn't know it 
                         was me...

               GABRIEL RAISES A DART TO THROW

                                     RUDY
                         I PROMISE YOU HE DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS 
                         ME!

               -- and then lowers it. Believing he's gotten a reprieve, 
               Rudy relaxes, his shivering coming under control.

                                     RUDY
                         Man, Monster... just... just don't 
                         start trying to hit me...

                                     GABRIEL
                         Nick. I been trying to hit you.

               Gabriel rears back and WHISTLES another dart. It plugs into 
               Rudy's chest. Rudy screams. Gabriel FIRES another, skewering 
               him in the ribs. Then a third, fourth and fifth.

               Rudy howls in pain, his body too numb to defend itself. Five 
               darts protrude from his chest, colorful plastic feathering 
               and spreading rivulets of blood.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Maybe that'll help sharpen your 
                         memory.

               Gabriel stalks close.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Tonight we're gonna take another 
                         look at that map. And this time you're 
                         gonna tell me what I need to know.

               INT. RUDY'S ROOM - DAY

               Rudy gets hurled inside by Merlin and Jumpy. He hits the 
               floor beside the bed, where Ashley sits prisoner. Pug sits 
               guard, watching "How The Grinch Stole Christmas" on TV.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Nick! Jesus, Nick --

               She falls to his side. Merlin cuffs Rudy's ankle again to 
               the bedframe. He and Jumpy head out --

                                     MERLIN
                         Pug.

               Pug's engrossed in the cartoon. They're singing in Whoville.

                                     MERLIN
                         PUG!

               Pug snaps to. Shuts off the TV, spits some chaw on the floor 
               and gone. Rudy and Ashley are left alone.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Nick, oh my God, what'd he do to 
                         you? What'd he do?

               She touches his bloodied chest. Rudy winces badly.

                                     RUDY
                         He had some points to make...

               Ashley helps pull his shirt off, sees the wounds:

                                     ASHLEY
                         Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move, 
                         stay right here --

                                     RUDY
                              (near-delirium)
                         All I wanted... was to make it home... 
                         for a little of Dad's turkey, and 
                         Mom's stuffing... Aunt Lisbeth's 
                         acorn gravy... Aunt Mary's cranberry 
                         buns...

               Ashley has leapt to the bathroom. She brings wet washcloths 
               back to clean and dress --

                                     ASHLEY
                         We'll get there, baby... we'll get 
                         there...

                                     RUDY
                         ...Haven't had cranberry buns... in 
                         five whole years...

                                     ASHLEY
                         Shh, now. Rest now. Two years, Nick. 
                         You haven't had cranberry buns in 
                         two years.

               She kisses him softly. Rudy meets her eyes. Staring to get 
               his bearings back...

                                     ASHLEY
                         You saved my life.
                              (beat)
                         You could have run, but you didn't. 
                         You saved me.

                                     RUDY
                         You saved me.

                                     ASHLEY
                         I saved you because I love you, Nick.
                              (smiles)
                         Why'd you save me?

               Rudy studies her hopeful face, attending to his wounds. still 
               weak and distant:

                                     RUDY
                         Guy I was in with... car thief... I 
                         used to read your letters to him. I 
                         know they were private... I know, 
                         but... you spend twenty-four hours a 
                         day with somebody, you gotta talk, 
                         y'know? You gotta share. Or the room 
                         gets even smaller.
                              (beat)
                         And sometimes, I'd be reading them, 
                         and he'd close his eyes, get a smile 
                         on his face... and I'd know somewhere 
                         inside he was pretending you were 
                         writing to him -- He'd see your face, 
                         your pictures on the wall...
                              (beat)
                         Some nights I think he fell in love 
                         with you, too.

               Rudy touches a hand to her hair.

                                     RUDY
                         You gave a couple guys hope, Ashley.  
                         And with hope, there ain't nothing 
                         you can't survive.

               Ashley stares, touched, still kneading the cloth into his 
               chest.

               Rudy struggles up, his face level with hers. She kisses him 
               tenderly. Lingering.

               And this time Rudy responds, mouth seeking, working down her 
               neck.

               Her eyes flutter closed.

                                     ASHLEY
                         I'm sorry, Nick... I'm so sorry...

                                     RUDY
                         Don't say my name...

                                     ASHLEY
                         I love you, Nick...

                                     RUDY
                         Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.

               Ashley hesitates. Carefully strokes his chest. He's still 
               kissing her, softly, still somewhat delirious.

                                     ASHLEY
                              (a small frown)
                         I love you...

               As he returns to her lips, mouths joining. Ashley's eyes 
               close again, as they fold into each other...

               ...and move slowly, tenderly, back to the floor.

               EXT. KNIGHTS INN HOTEL - DUSK

               A bitter cold sunset. Through a room's window, Rudy and Ashley 
               lie tangled in sheets on the carpet.

               INT. RUDY'S ROOM

               Ashley nestles against him. Rudy stares skyward. Hard.

                                     RUDY
                         They'll have guns.

                                     ASHLEY
                         What?

                                     RUDY
                         You said they've run guns, in their 
                         trucks. So they'll have guns. To do 
                         this robbery. They'll have serious 
                         guns.

                                     ASHLEY
                         I don't know...

                                     RUDY
                         We'll need one.

               Ashley frowns. There's a new look in Rudy's eyes.

                                     RUDY
                         I'm going to have to be inside that 
                         casino. When it happens. I'll need 
                         to be part of it. I can't just be 
                         drawing some map.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Nick, what are you talking about?

                                     RUDY
                         We need to find a way to make me 
                         part of it.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Part of... with them?

               Rudy meets her eyes.

                                     RUDY
                         If we're helping them with their 
                         robbery, we're gonna be doing more 
                         than just walking away. Like that's 
                         some Christmas bonus.

               He nods, scheming the way he's always known.

                                     RUDY
                         You want him outta your life? You 
                         want a real New Year to look forward 
                         to?
                              (bravely)
                         If we're gonna do this... we're gonna 
                         do it to get it all.

               INT. KNIGHTS INN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               A medieval-themed biergarten. A happy FAMILY of five sits at 
               a booth, singing along to "Good King Wencelas."

               In the booth beside, Merlin and Pug are holding court. 
               Merlin's puffing smoke rings. Pug watches dully, chewing:

                                     PUG
                         Knew a guy in Joliet, smoked ten 
                         packs a day like you. His lungs got 
                         so black they couldn't find 'em with 
                         an x-ray.

                                     MERLIN
                         That right? Shit. I used to run rigs 
                         for a guy loved your chaw there. 
                         Shit rotted out his tongue, had to 
                         build him one outta silicon so the 
                         poor boy could talk. You ever see a 
                         motherfucker with a silicon fucking 
                         tongue?

               The Happy Family stops singing. Pug considers, spits a wad.

                                     PUG
                         Hell. The guy from Joliet, those 
                         black-ass lungs were the least of 
                         his problems. Got so much smoke in 
                         him his lungs couldn't even hold it. 
                         Got into his system, man. Into his 
                         blood. Coming out his ears, man, 
                         coming out his eyes. Guy'd be walking 
                         the row, smoke'd be puffing out his 
                         skin.

               The Happy Family trade discomfited looks. Merlin shrugs, 
               takes another drag.

                                     MERLIN
                         This trucker? Met a girl in a bar 
                         one night, she didn't know his 
                         situation. He's drunk, she's drunk, 
                         they get to mackin' hot and heavy 
                         and the woman swallows it. His tongue. 
                         Sucks it right down.

                                     PUG
                         My guy would walk into a room, set 
                         off the goddamn sprinklers.

                                     MERLIN
                         His lips went next. You ever see 
                         some silicon-fucking-lips?

               The Happy Family flees their booth. Pug and Merlin glance 
               over. And grab their leftovers. Rifling the grub:

                                     MERLIN
                              (with disgust)
                         Vegetarians...

               Behind them, Gabriel and Jumpy file into the biergarten, 
               leading Rudy and Ashley to the booth. Meeting commenced.

               Rudy, battered and freezer-burnt, gets shoved in first. 
               Gabriel throws down the casino map:

                                     GABRIEL
                         Start singing.

                                     RUDY
                         I have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum-
                         pum-pum

                                     GABRIEL
                         Sing it in pictures, Nick.

               Rudy takes the map, glances at Ashley, and then takes charge. 
               For the first time, he's giving the orders:

                                     RUDY
                         What you gotta worry about first is 
                         the guards. Place doesn't look much 
                         richer than when I worked there, so 
                         let's figure you're gonna have to 
                         deal with ten of 'em. There'll be 
                         two on the floor, walking the room, 
                         that leaves eight up above. Eyes in 
                         the sky. They see something up, 
                         they're the ones who'll hit the silent 
                         alarm and you're fucked.

                                     MERLIN
                         How do we take them out?

                                     RUDY
                         You gotta get someone upstairs.

                                     MERLIN
                         How do we do that?

               Rudy takes the map, points to the gaming tables area:

                                     RUDY
                         Across from blackjack, there's a 
                         security doorway. Keypad access.

                                     GABRIEL
                         What's the code?

                                     RUDY
                         Uh... they change it every month. I 
                         wouldn't know.
                              (beat)
                         If there's trouble on the floor, 
                         you'll get security coming through. 
                         what you gotta do, is get inside 
                         that doorway once they do. You gotta 
                         draw 'em out.

                                     PUG
                         Without having them hit the alarms.

                                     RUDY
                         I got an idea on that one. Once you're 
                         up there, you gotta hold those guards 
                         down till some backup can get there. 
                         There's a security camera room that 
                         videotapes everything. You've gotta 
                         destroy every last one of those tapes.

                                     MERLIN
                         What about the money?

                                     RUDY
                         You lock down security, you move 
                         behind the cage. You hit the Count 
                         Room. There'll be a guy in there but 
                         he's got no guns; room's accessed by 
                         another code. Cashiers'll know it. 
                         They'll have alarms.

                                     JUMPY
                         What about the Powwow Safe?

                                     RUDY
                         What?

                                     JUMPY
                         The Powwow Safe. The secret safe.  
                         You said the manager's got a safe in 
                         his office where he hides skim money.

                                     RUDY
                         Oh. Right. Yeah. That's, uh upstairs. 
                         Uh. Here. Powwow Safe.

               His confident manner wavers. Gabriel notices, narrows his 
               eyes. Rudy quickly grabs the map again:

                                     RUDY
                         So. You're gonna need a man through 
                         here, two men at the cage, one to 
                         cover the count. You're gonna need a 
                         lookout outside, a sweeper through 
                         the back, and a gun guarding the 
                         front.
                              (beat)
                         You need six.

                                     GABRIEL
                         We got five. Putting Ashley outside.

                                     RUDY
                         You need six.

               Gabriel eyes him darkly.

                                     GABRIEL
                         NO.

                                     RUDY
                         You go in with five, you're either 
                         leaving an alarm free or an exit 
                         free. Someone hits an alarm, you're 
                         fucked. Someone gets to a phone, 
                         gets outside, 'cross the street, 
                         whatever, you're fucked. You need 
                         six.
                              (nods)
                         Six is me.

                                     GABRIEL
                         No.

                                     RUDY
                         You guys get caught, I go away for 
                         good. I got an interest in making 
                         sure you don't. You need a sixth man 
                         covering an exit. What're you gonna 
                         do about it.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Yeah. What're you gonna do about it.

               She puts an arm around Rudy, smiles. That's her man.

                                     GABRIEL
                         I want a map of that security level.  
                         Every room, every guard, every thing.

                                     RUDY
                         Six men means six guns.

                                     GABRIEL
                         No way.

                                     RUDY
                         I'm no threat without a gun.

                                     GABRIEL
                         No, you're not.

                                     RUDY
                         There'll be people in that casino.  
                         I can't keep them from leaving if I 
                         don't get a gun. I don't need bullets, 
                         Monster... but I gotta be a threat.

                                     ASHLEY
                         What's the matter, Gabriel? This is 
                         what you wanted him for, isn't it?

               Gabriel's eyes don't leave Rudy's.

                                     GABRIEL
                         No gun.

                                     RUDY
                         Well. What you guys have to plan 
                         out, then... is how you're going to 
                         get to that cage and that security 
                         level before anybody realizes 
                         anything's wrong. Running in with 
                         ski masks and bullets flying ain't 
                         gonna do it.

                                     GABRIEL
                         That part, Nick... was planned out 
                         the day I read your letters.

                                     RUDY
                         What. We all gonna dress up like 
                         cowboys?

                                     GABRIEL
                         Not cowboys, Nick. Not cowboys.

               Gabriel smiles.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Not on Christmas Eve.

               INT. GABRIEL'S RIG - TRAILER - NIGHT CLOSE ON STORAGE LOCKER

               Pulled open to reveal FIVE SANTA CLAUS SUITS, hanging side- 
               by-side. Red polyester coats and pants, white felt trim and 
               black buckles, black boots and red caps.

               WIDEN TO REVEAL TRAILER

               As Gabriel lifts a Santa Claus suit and presses it against 
               Rudy. Ashley, Merlin, Jungy and Pug look on.

                                     RUDY
                         You gotta be kidding me.

                                     GABRIEL
                         'Tis the season, convict.

               He puts the suit back in the locker, pulls another. Finding 
               Rudy's size.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Can't be attracting attention, right?

                                     RUDY
                         What, we walking in there and 
                         delivering toys?

               He turns to see Merlin open another locker. This one stacked 
               with rifles, carbines and handguns.

                                     MERLIN
                         Hell yeah.

               INT. RUDY'S ROOM - NIGHT

               CLOSE ON SKETCH

               of a floor plan, a sheet of paper overlaid on Gabriel's map 
               of the casino. A pencil draws a boxy room and labels it 
               "Security Video Room." Then an eraser wipes it out.

               WIDEN TO REVEAL RUDY

               still cuffed to the bedframe, pulled close to a desk. He's 
               sitting, working on the security level map.

               The door opens; Ashley enters, looking worried:

                                     ASHLEY
                         He wants to see your map.

                                     RUDY
                         I'm almost done.

                                     ASHLEY
                         He says he wants it now.

                                     RUDY
                         If he wanted a photographic memory, 
                         he shoulda kidnapped one. I'm working 
                         on it here.

               Ashley walks over, puts her arms around his neck. Whispers:

                                     ASHLEY
                         How are we gonna do this, Nick?

                                     RUDY
                         You're the getaway girl. The money's 
                         gonna get to you eventually. Gonna 
                         be my job to be the guy who walks 
                         outta there with it. But I can't do 
                         that without a gun. Any luck talking 
                         to him?

                                     ASHLEY
                         Bullets or no bullets, he won't do 
                         it.

                                     RUDY
                         Is there any way you could get into 
                         his truck?

                                     ASHLEY
                         No.

                                     RUDY
                         We need a gun, Ash. We need a gun...

               Rudy studies his map, then quickly pencils in the "Security 
               Video Room," in a totally different place than he drew it 
               before. Hands the paper to her.

                                     RUDY
                         Here's the Picasso. Is he in his 
                         room?

                                     ASHLEY
                         They all are. Football's on.

                                     RUDY
                              (nods, thinks)
                         Keep 'em there for a little while.

               Ashley takes the map, frowns. Rudy kisses her gently.

                                     RUDY
                         We're gonna get you out of Detroit, 
                         Ash. Get you out of beauty and 
                         fragrances.
                              (smiles, then)
                         Remember that. After all this is 
                         over, when you know me, when you 
                         really know me... remember it was 
                         me.

               She searches his eyes, not quite understanding. But smiles. 
               Rudy smiles back, nods toward the door. Ashley slips out.

               When she's gone, Rudy stands and turns to the window. Outside, 
               the Blazer with the "Ice Fishermen Do It All Year Long" bumper 
               sticker still sits parked.

               Rudy reaches for his jeans pocket, and pulls out-one of the 
               game room darts, flecked with blood.

               HE GIVES IT A SOLEMN STARE

               INT. RUDYS ROOM - MOMENTS L&TER - NIGHT

               Rudy lies on his back, under the bed frame, dart in hand. He 
               tears off the plastic feathering, to get at the cross-shaped 
               end, furthest-from the tip. Four protruding metal edges.

               He finds the Phillips screws on the bedframe, and tries to 
               work the dart-end into the grooves. It scrapes and jags, but 
               with pressure he's able to do a quarter-turn at a time.

               The screw starts spiraling out.

               ANGLE ON BEDFRAME

               As two metal pieces split apart, and Rudy wriggles his ankle 
               handcuff off the frame.

               ANGLE ON CLOSET

               As Rudy's hand grabs a paper-covered wire hanger and rips 
               the paper off, untwisting the wire.

               ANGLE ON ROOM'S WINDOW

               As Rudy slides it open, and climbs outside.

               EXT. KNIGHTS INN PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Light snow falling. Rudy drops from the second floor window 
               into some snowy shrubs and an empty parking space. He 
               stealthily darts ahead to the ice fishermen's Blazer.

               AT THE FISHERMEN'S BLAZER

               Rudy peers in the windows, spotting fishing rods, tackle and 
               gear boxes in the back seat.

               He takes his wire coat hanger, now stretched straight, and 
               slips it between the driver's window and moulding, jamming 
               it around until it trips the door lock.

               The lock pops up; Rudy pops in --

               INT. BLAZER

               -- and raids the gear box. Bait, reels, fishing wire. Boning 
               knives. A compass. A first aid kit. A switchblade.

                                     RUDY
                         Gun, gun, c'mon, boys like you gotta 
                         be keeping a gun...

               He rustles around in the backseat. Ice cooler, open bag of 
               pork rinds, another gear box. Nothing.

               Some HEADLIGHTS sweep past the Blazer. Rudy ducks down, 
               pockets the switchblade. Munches some pork rinds.

               EXT. PARKING LOT

               Rudy scrambles out, heads to try another car, a pickup truck. 
               And then suddenly drops to the ground, seeing

               MERLIN AND JUMPY

               stride outside, talking casually, kicking snow on their way 
               toward the Nova. Voices too low to hear.

               ON SCENE

               Rudy crouches behind the pickup, slips around the other side.  
               Merlin and Jumpy walk right by him.

               Rudy criss-crosses through the parking lot, hidden by cars, 
               heading away from his room's window. His window. Rudy glances 
               back to see if the truckers notice that, but they don't seem 
               to. They stand at the Nova, talking.

               Rudy shivers, waiting. They're not leaving. When their backs 
               turn, Rudy dashes twenty feet to the cover of the building. 
               He slips around the corner, out of sight.

               AROUND THE SIDE OF THE HOTEL

               Rudy hops through snowdrifts, pressed to the wall, moving 
               toward a side entry --

               -- when he stops, hearing a woman's LAUGHTER.

               Above his head are a row of windows. Reflections of rippling 
               water on the ceiling inside. It's the hotel pool behind this 
               wall.

               Sounds of SPLASHES. Murmured VOICES.

               Rudy stands absolutely still. His breaths stop frosting. 
               Because his breathing has stopped.

               INT. HALLLWAY TO INDOOR POOL - NIGHT

               Rudy creeps down the darkened hall, past a sign that reads 
               "Pool CLOSED. Open 9 am to 9 pm, No Lifeguard on Duty."

               Rudy steps closer, back to a wall, standing in shadow. The 
               small pool becomes visible, flickering blue water. From an 
               unseen end, a figure splashes backwards into view --

               It's Ashley. Hair wet, naked beneath the surface. Smiling 
               and splashing someone offscreen --

                                     ASHLEY
                         ...and he's saying "We're not gonna 
                         help him just to walk away. If we're 
                         gonna help him... we're gonna get it 
                         all...

               She splashes again. Taunting --

                                     ASHLEY
                         ...he wants to help now, he wants to 
                         rob it now we could probably stay 
                         right here, he'd go on and rob it by 
                         himself --

               As Gabriel steps into view, also undressed, moving toward 
               her in the pool.

                                     GABRIEL
                         He wants the money.

                                     ASHLEY
                         No, baby. He wants me.

               Gabriel reaches her, puts his arms around her. She smiles.

                                     ASHLEY
                         He wants... your "sister"...

                                     GABRIEL
                         ...whoever she is.

               And they kiss, entwining together, reflections and ripples. 
               A steamy embrace.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Nick Mason's gonna help us more than 
                         we ever dreamed.

               ANGLE ON RUDY

               in the shadows, hearing them. Staring into darkness.

               IN THE POOL

               Gabriel turns with Ashley, wrapped together. Moving slow.

                                     GABRIEL
                         All those letters are about to pay 
                         off, baby... all those letters...

                                     ASHLEY
                         To all those cons...

                                     GABRIEL
                         Searching for a money man...

                                     ASHLEY
                         We musta written what, twenty of 
                         'em? And they were before this guy.  
                         One, two letters apiece, ten to the 
                         racetrack guy in Leavenworth --

                                     GABRIEL
                         -- till he fucked his parole --

                                     ASHLEY
                         -- plus the forty to Mason... how 
                         many letters is that?

                                     GABRIEL
                         That's a book, baby.
                              (presses closer)
                         That's a book of love.

               They kiss again. Gabriel strokes her wet hair:

                                     GABRIEL
                         I can't take watching you touch him.  
                         I can't take his hands on you.

                                     ASHLEY
                         One more day, baby. One more day to 
                         Christmas.

                                     GABRIEL
                         I've been doing good, though.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Didn't have to hit me so fucking 
                         hard. Didn't have to throw me outta 
                         the goddamn truck.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Didn't have to send me down a fucking 
                         mountain.

                                     ASHLEY
                         What, he should see me help you catch 
                         him?

               ON RUDY

               still in the shadows, welling with betrayal.

                                     ASHLEY (O.S.)
                         He's shown us the setup, he's drawn 
                         us the map, he's helped us do the 
                         plan. He wants a gun, give him a 
                         gun. Take the bullets out, whatever, 
                         but give him the gun. The more 
                         manpower we've got in there, the 
                         better. He won't try and make his 
                         move till the money's in hand.

                                     GABRIEL (O.S.)
                         He'll be dead when he does.

               BACK IN THE POOL

               Gabriel and Ashley rock slowly, coupled, in the water.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Y'know something, baby? If you were 
                         my sister? I'd still want to wake up 
                         Christmas morning with you...

                                     ASHLEY
                         Mmm, baby. And I'd still want to be 
                         the tinsel round your tree...

               And as their words turn to moans and murmurs...

               IN THE SHADOWS

               Rudy is gone.

               INT. FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Rudy strides a corridor, eyes dead ahead, passing a stairwell 
               on his way toward the "Exit" sign posted above a door. He's 
               almost there, marching fast --

                                     RUDY
                         Here's my present to you, truck 
                         drivers --

               AS THE EXIT DOOR OPENS

                                     MERLIN (O.S.)
                         Where the hell's Gabriel?

               -- and Rudy dives to the stairwell, out of sight just as 
               Merlin and Jumpy stride back inside.

                                     JUMPY
                         With his girlfriend. Making up for 
                         "Nick" time. I'm going down to the 
                         bar, you want something?

                                     MERLIN
                         Get me a brew. I'm gonna check on 
                         our convict.

               They separate, Jumpy down the hall, Merlin to the stairs --

               INT. STAIRWELL

               Merlin trudges upward, while Rudy steps from hiding one flight 
               down.

               Checks the hall for Jumpy, then races out --

               EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Rudy slams out the side door, scrambling straight for the 
               same Blazer. He jimmies the lock again, leaps in, tears free 
               the engine panel and searches for ignition wires like a pro.  
               Stripping the plastic, trying to spark contact --

                                     RUDY
                         Catch, dammit, catch! Like riding a 
                         bike, it's like riding a bike!

               But there's nothing. The engine won't start.

               INT. STAIRWELL

               Merlin reaches the second floor, steps into the hall.

               EXT. PARKING LOT

               Rudy jumps from the Blazer, looks at the lot, the highway, 
               the woods. His own footprints in the dusting snow.

                                     RUDY
                         How far you gonna get, Rudy...

               Realizing the answer, Rudy looks to his room's window. Forced 
               to race back. He tries clambering the wall, standing an 
               shrubbery, but he can't reach. He whirls, desperate.

               And his eyes find the Blazer.

               INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL

               Merlin ambles the corridor. Approaching Rudy's room.

               EXT. PARKING LOT

               Rudy flings open the Blazer door, slams the emergency brake 
               down. Forces the gearshift into "Reverse."

               INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL

               Merlin reaches Rudy's door. Searches his pockets for the 
               key.

               EXT. PARKING LOT

               Rudy darts to the front of the Blazer, slipping and sliding 
               on asphalt ice. He drops to his knees, pushing on the front 
               bumper.

               The wheels start to move.

               INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL

               Merlin finds a room key. Puts it in the lock. Turns the handle 
               but the door won't open. Merlin checks the key.

                                     MERLIN
                         My room.

               EXT. PARKING LOT

               The Blazer starts to roll backwards, toward the snowy shrubs 
               ringing the building. Headed for the empty parking space 
               below Rudy's window. Rudy keeps pushing. The Blazer picks up 
               speed, rolling on its own.

               INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL

               Merlin searches his pockets again, finds the right key.

               EXT. PARKING LOT

               The Blazer rolls toward the building. Rudy scrambles to his 
               feet, runs after it, leaps his left foot onto the bumper, 
               the right foot onto the hood, then onto the roof --

               -- getting two roof-steps worth of running start --

               -- as the Blazer slows to a rest against the snowy shrubs --

               -- and Rudy dives into the air, torpedoing himself right 
               through the window to his room --

               INT. RUDY'S ROOM

               -- where he crashes headlong to the floor, turning a 
               somersault and landing sprawled across the carpet.

               INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL

               The key in the lock, Merlin hears the crash --

               INT. RUDY'S ROOM

               -- and as Merlin opens the door, he finds Rudy sitting calmly 
               on the floor, ankle-cuff locked once again to the bedframe. 
               Spreading a deck of cards out before him.

               Starting a game of solitaire. He looks up.

                                     RUDY
                         Hey.

               Merlin frowns, takes a suspicious look around the room. The 
               window's open. Rudy continues his card game.

               Merlin watches him for a long time. Then pulls the door shut.

               Once he's gone, Rudy collapses to the floor. Breathing hard, 
               heart pounding. The cards go flying.

               INT. RUDY'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

               The LIGHTS go out. Rudy creeps back to the window, checks 
               outside... and stops still. In parking lot...

               ...a cigarette glow burns inside the Nova. From the driver's 
               seat. It's Merlin. Now watching.

               Rudy steps back into the shadows. Closing window and watches 
               the falling snow. Caged again, after all.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. RUDY'S ROOM - NIGHT - LATER

               Pitch dark. Rudy asleep on the floor, as Ashley creeps back 
               in.

               Seeing he's asleep, she lies beside him, pulls a blanket 
               over them both, nestles into his body and kisses him.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Merry Christmas-Eve, my love. My 
                         love, my love. Merry Christmas-Eve...

               Ashley closes her eyes. With a smile.

               A moment later, Rudy's eyes open. Turning to look at her 
               smiling, sleeping face... with a convict's vengeful stare...

               INT. KNIGHTS INN LOBBY - DAY

               CLOSE ON DESK CLERK

               In a elfin cap, smiling cheerfully:

                                     SMILING DESK CLERK
                         Hello, gentlemen. And how can we 
                         help you on this holiday morning?

               CLOSE ON GABRIEL, MERLIN AND PUG

               Three grim faces.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Checking out.

               EXT. KNIGHTS INN PARKING LOT - DAY

               The three truckers stride to the Nova, where Jumpy guards 
               Rudy and Ashley. In the b.g., the Ice Fishermen are by their 
               car, wondering how the hell it switched parking spaces 
               overnight.

               Gabriel marches straight to Rudy and SLUGS him in the gut. 
               Rudy hits the snow --

                                     ASHLEY
                         Gabriel!

                                     GABRIEL
                         That's for the hundred bucks worth 
                         of pay-per-view.
                              (then KICKS him)
                         And that's for the two hundred you 
                         took outta your minibar.

                                     RUDY
                              (chokes, pained)
                         You guys were paying for the room, I 
                         just figured --

               Gabriel KICKS him again, then pulls a handgun, points it at 
               Rudy's head. Ashley screams, rushes him --

               -- as Gabriel's gun SHOOTS a thin stream of water into Rudy's 
               face.

               It's a forty-five caliber squirt gun.

                                     GABRIEL
                              (cruel smile)
                         You wanted a weapon, convict? You 
                         got one.

               Gabriel tosses the water pistol onto Rudy's chest. Jumpy and 
               Pug haul him up. With venom:

                                     GABRIEL
                         Merry Christmas-Eve.

               EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

               The Motor City Monster cruises the snowy landscape, with 
               Lake Superior beyond. Pug drives the Nova in convoy.

               INT. GABRIEL'S RIG

               Gabriel hands copies of Rudy's sketched map to Merlin and 
               Jumpy.

               Rudy and Ashley are in the sleeper.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Commit this thing to memory. Every 
                         guard, every exit... don't tape it 
                         to your fuckin, wrist: remember it. 
                         That's the Gospel right there. The 
                         Gospel. Matthew, Mark, Luke and 
                         John...

               Rudy watches them studying his made-up map. Ashley strokes 
               his arm, gives a loving smile. Rudy stares at her.

               He smiles right back.

               EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

               The rig and the Nova blow by a roadsign: "Now Entering 
               Powahachee Indian Reservation Lands."

               INT./EXT. TRAILER DAY - PREPARATION MONTAGE

               The storage locker with the Santa suits SLAMS open.

               Merlin's hands PULL automatics and shotguns from the weapons 
               chest. Pug's hands UNLOAD ammo.

               A red-and-white Santa coat gets PULLED ON and BUTTONED UP.

               Jumpy's hands apportion GUNS and AMMO on a picnic table.

               Black Santa boots STAMP TIGHT in the snow.

               A shoulder-strap ASSAULT RIFLE gets hidden under a Santa 
               coat.

               AMMO CLIPS are taped inside a fat black buckle-belt.

               A HANDGUN gets tucked under a Santa hat.

               And the rig's trailer doors come CRASHING SHUT.

               EXT. LAKESIDE REST AREA - DUSK

               Lake Superior shimmers in the dying light. The rig's in the 
               empty rest area lot. On a nearby bank, four men in Santa 
               Claus suits and one woman without sit scattered at picnic 
               tables, guns at their sides. Staring out at the lake.

               RUDY AND ASHLEY

               sit apart from the rest. Rudy in a red suit, black boots, 
               cap in hand. Ashley's head is in his lap, watching the sky.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Where should we go, Nick? When we're 
                         gone from here... where should we 
                         go...

               The Nova drives into the lot. Pug gets out, carrying several 
               fast-food bags. Hurrying to stay warm:

                                     PUG (O.S.)
                         Okay, who had the cheeseburger with 
                         bacon; what about a roast beef, I've 
                         got two roast beefs here --

                                     JUMPY (O.S.)
                         Cheeseburger 'n bacon's mine --

                                     MERLIN (O.S.)
                         I got a bacon too; there another 
                         bacon in there?

                                     PUG (O.S.)
                         I got a bacon for him and a bacon 
                         for me; there's four cheeseburgers 
                         and two roast beefs --

                                     MERLIN (O.S.)
                         Somebody better give me something 
                         with some goddamn bacon --

               As they continue chow dispersal, Rudy stares over the lake.

               Distant. Not even aware Ashley's there.

                                     RUDY
                         This time right now... Dad's stacking 
                         wood out back, getting ready for 
                         tomorrow. Little blaze in the 
                         fireplace. Mom's setting out the 
                         good silver, hanging her cinammon 
                         sticks, up in the doorways. Getting 
                         out her scratchy old records... 
                         singing along...

               Rudy smiles to himself. He's got a faraway look.

                                     RUDY
                         I don't know where you're going.  
                         But I'm going home.

                                     ASHLEY
                         We go together, Nick. Wherever... we 
                         go together. Remember?

                                     RUDY
                         Well. I'm going home.

               GABRIEL

               sits by the water, staring over the lake too. With a white 
               cotton Santa beard resting on his chin. He unwraps his roast 
               beef sandwich, pulls his beard down to his neck, and takes a 
               savage bite.

               Munches away, stares to Rudy and Ashley. She meets his eyes.  
               Gabriel smiles. And looks again to the water.

               ON FULL SCENE

               The snowy rest stop, the glistening lake. And the six figures 
               scattered, watching day turn to night...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. TOMAHAWK CASINO - NIGHT

               The neon axe lit up in full regalia, with Christmas lights 
               now strung along the building's roof. There are fewer than a 
               dozen cars in the parking lot.

               INT. TOMAHAWK - NIGHT

               Filled with the JINGLING, JANGLING slots, but there's only 
               two FAT WOMEN sitting at them. Three INDIANS at a poker table. 
               An OLD TIMER in his 90's playing blackjack.

               INT. SECURITY LEVEL

               A ragged headquarters, looking down to the casino level 
               through smoked glass. Desks, file cabinets, pin-up 
               centerfolds. A room with video monitors to one side. Stairs 
               to a camera catwalk that rings the casino.

               Jack Bangs is at a table of wassail and cookies. He opens a 
               battle of brandy, pours a bit into the punch, and takes the 
               bottle for himself. Walks over to his HEAD OF SECURITY, 
               watching the lack of activity below:

                                     JACK BANGS
                         And all through the house... not a 
                         creature was stirring...
                              (sighs)
                         Why don't you go ahead and send most 
                         of your guys home, Ed.

                                     SECURITY BOSS
                         Thanks, Jack. Merry X-mas.

               The boss smiles, heads off. Jack Bangs swigs his brandy, 
               eyes his high-tech security gear glumly:

                                     JACK BANGS
                         Hell. Nobody even comes here to 
                         cheat...

               EXT. TOMAHAWK - NIGHT

               The Nova pulls into the lot and parks. Merlin, Pug and Ashley 
               inside. On the road, the Motor City Monster slows to an idling 
               stop. In the cab, Gabriel turns to Rudy and Jumpy:

                                     GABRIEL
                         Go.

               Rudy gives Gabriel a withering look. He and Jumpy climb out.

               Gabriel's rig rumbles up the road.

               [NOTE: All five men, save Ashley, from now till story's end, 
               are in their Santa Claus suits.]

               RUDY AND JUMPY

               make their way across the lot, heading for the entrance.

                                     RUDY
                         Hey Jumpy, I want to ask you 
                         something. You have any problem with 
                         the fact that we're on our way to 
                         take millions of dollars from an 
                         Indian casino?

               The Native American considers. As they walk:

                                     JUMPY
                         Nick. It's true that Indian gaming's 
                         gone a long way toward restoring 
                         wealth and pride to communities who've 
                         been economically isolated and 
                         enslaved for centuries. Stronger 
                         infrastructure, better schools, higher 
                         employment... they're all the results 
                         of reservation casino success stories. 
                         Still, many natives believe that 
                         these are temples to a godless 
                         materialism and greed that will only 
                         infect the souls of indigenous peoples 
                         until their love of money has 
                         destroyed the spiritual values their 
                         ancestors died to protect and their 
                         homelands have become no different 
                         from any United States suburb, 
                         satellite city or industrial park.  
                         Destroying the Indian legacy once 
                         and for all and leaving behind a 
                         nation of selfish, angry natives, of 
                         which I, it's true, am one --

               -- as they hit the Tomahawk's doors --

               INT. TOKAHAWK - NIGHT

               -- and SLAM inside, stumbling into each other, suddenly 
               LAUGHING and slapping backs. Surveying the casino:

                                     RUDY
                         Hey-hey, egg nog for everybody!

               Rudy spreads his Santa arms wide and whoops. Jumpy laughs 
               with him, steadying his balance. Drunken and slurred:

                                     RUDY
                         Let's win some MONEY! MONEY-MONEY- 
                         MONEY!

               The few gamblers inside look up at the commotion. Bear the 
               Bartender. Two CASHIERS and one WAITRESS. Ed the Security 
               Boss strides over, smiling tightly:

                                     SECURITY BOSS
                         How you gentlemen doing tonight?

                                     RUDY
                         We're out of work tonight, that's 
                         how! Christmas Eve! We're out of 
                         work!

                                     JUMPY
                              (shakes his hand)
                         Hi, Santa Claus, how are you. He's 
                         with Sears, I'm with Wal-Mart, twas 
                         the season...

                                     RUDY
                         We're all outta gifts, boys and girls, 
                         but we got charitable donations!

               Rudy grabs a wad of bills from his pocket, drops some to the 
               floor. Jumpy retrieves them --

                                     JUMPY
                         ...bunch of us got together for the 
                         union party. Hey, how late are you 
                         open?

                                     SECURITY BOSS
                              (eyes on the money)
                         All night and all day.

                                     RUDY
                         I got wampum for the Cocktail Waitress 
                         Civil Defense Fund! Are there any 
                         representatives here present?

               A Waitress sidles close; checks with the Boss. He nods okay.

                                     WAITRESS
                         What can I get ya, Santa?

                                     RUDY
                         Santa drinks American beer.

                                     SECURITY BOSS
                              (to Jumpy)
                         What's your game, guys?

                                     JUMPY
                         Blackjack. Got a buddy from 
                         Woolworth's out parking the sleigh.

               The Security Boss stares him down. Then:

                                     SECURITY BOSS
                         Good luck, gentlemen.

               He steps aside and indicates the tables. Jumpy claps him on 
               the back, pushes Rudy on through the slots.

               EXT. RESERVATION ROAD - NIGHT

               Gabriel's truck at the roadside, hazards on, with signal 
               triangles as if broken down. Gabriel places the last one, 
               hurries back down the casino road.

               EXT. PARKING LOT/INT. NOVA - NIGHT

               Ashley sits between Merlin and Pug. Gabriel jogs by the car.

               Ashley checks her watch:

                                     ASHLEY
                         Three minutes.

               INT. TOMAHAWK - NIGHT

               Rudy and Jumpy sit at a blackjack table, beside the Old Timer.

               Jovial ad libs as the Waitress brings Rudy's beer. Rudy 
               doubles down, busts, and gets belligerent:

                         RUDY
                    (to the Old Timer)
                 That was my card, pop! 
                 My card! You hit for 
                 my card!

                         OLD TIMER
                 I... sorry, Mister...

                         RUDY
                 That was my king!

                         OLD TIMER
                 Well...sorry...

                                                       JUMPY
                                                  (to the Waitress)
                                               How are you tonight?

                                                       WAITRESS
                                               Fuckin' freezing. What can I get ya, 
                                               Santa?

                                                       JUMPY
                                               Jack and Coke.

                                                       WAITRESS
                                               Want that Jack and Coke or Jack and 
                                               Pepsi? 

               Behind them, Gabriel SLAMS through the casino doors.

                                     JUMPY
                         Woolworth's!

                                     GABRIEL
                         Hey, Sears! Hey, Wal-Mart!

                                     JUMPY
                         Saved you a seat, man. Get in on a 
                         hand here!

               Gabriel sidles to the table, claps Rudy on the back.

                                     RUDY
                              (re: Old Timer)
                         Careful. Watch out for this guy.

               They throw chips in. The Waitress circles around:

                                     WAITRESS
                         What can I get ya, Santa?

                                     GABRIEL
                         American beer.

               The Old Timer hits and stays. Rudy hits and busts:

                                     RUDY
                         POP! That was My card!

                                     OLD TIMER
                         But... I had a five...

                                     RUDY
                         You're hitting for MY cards!

               EXT. PARKING LOT

               Ashley's eyes on her watch. Nods to Merlin and Pug:

                                     ASHLEY
                         Go.

               INT. TOMAHAWK

               Jumpy has left the table, sidling to a change booth, glancing 
               at his watch. Passes a $100 bill:

                                     JUMPY
                         Could Fat-Man-With-Flying-Horse get 
                         some quarters, please?

               AT THE BLACKJACK

               Gabriel slides off his stool, punches Rudy in the shoulder:

                                     GABRIEL
                         Be back, Wal-Mart. Watch my bank.

               Rudy nods, slugging beer. He's becoming an unruly drinker. 
               The Old Timer motions to hit; but before the Dealer can pull 
               the card, Rudy slams the table, points to it:

                                     RUDY
                         That is my card, guy. My card.

                                     DEALER
                         He hit, mister.

                                     RUDY
                         He didn't hit.
                              (to Old Timer)
                         You didn't hit. You're not hitting.

                                     OLD TIMER
                         But you don't even know what it is!

               The dealer hits grandpa to twenty-one. Then hits Rudy and 
               busts him. Rudy stares darkly.

               IN THE HALL TO THE BATHROOMS

               Gabriel walks to the men's room door. Then stops. Adjusts 
               the rifle under his red coat. And turns back.

               AT THE CHANGE BOOTH

               Jumpy is handed a bucket of quarters.

               EXT. PARKING LOT - SAME

               Merlin and Pug march toward the entrance, hands in pockets.

               INT. SECURITY LEVEL

               The Security Boss returns upstairs, beside Jack Bangs, who's 
               watching the video monitors. On one screen, a parking lot 
               cam shows Merlin and Pug approaching:

                                     VIDEO GUARD
                         There's two more coming.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         Hell, there we go. That's the spirit.

               He drunkenly clinks his battle to the Security Boss, wassail. 
               The Boss frowns.

                                     SECURITY BOSS
                         Jack? Is there a union for department 
                         store Santas?

               INT. TOMAHAWK - ON BLACKJACK

               Rudy bolts up suddenly, sends chips and his chair to the 
               carpet.

               Points sternly at the Old Timer, slurring:

                                     RUDY
                         Switch seats with me.

                                     OLD TIMER
                         What? No...

                                     RUDY
                         You're taking my money. Switch seats 
                         with me. Switch seats with me if 
                         you're not taking my money --

                                     OLD TIMER
                         I'm ninety-two years old --

                                     RUDY
                         Then get yourself another table!  
                         You're hitting Santa's cards and 
                         you're taking Santa's money!

                                     OLD TIMER
                         There is no other table --

                                     RUDY
                         THEY'LL OPEN ONE!

               Rudy grabs the blackjack table and wrenches with all his 
               might,

               OVERTURNING IT, cards, chips, cash scattering --

               AND EVERYTHING HAPPENS AT ONCE

               Two SECURITY GUARDS at the door (?) rush for Rudy --

               Gabriel steps from the restroom, hall, moves toward the keypad 
               door to the security level --

               Jumpy carries his bucket of quarters past the cage --

               Rudy tackles the Old Timer, fists and false teeth flying, as 
               the Guards arrive, trying to wrench him off the poor guy --

                                     RUDY
                              (hard whisper)
                         Stay down, pop! Trust me, stay down!

               As Gabriel stops just beyond the keypad door --

               IN THE SECURITY LEVEL

               The Security Boss grabs more men, while Jack Bangs merely 
               smiles at the sight. Guards wrestling a drunken Santa:

                                     SECURITY BOSS
                         Help them down there! HELP them!

               IN THE CASINO

               Three guards CHARGE out of the keypad door --

               -- right past Gabriel, who slips deftly inside --

               AND UP THE PRIVATE STAIRCASE

               -- opening his coat, pulling his assault rifle --

               GABRIEL

               Right at the top of the stairs, right at the top of the 
               stairs...

               -- charging to the top, starting right and running SMACK 
               into a wall.

               He spins, sees the doorway's on his left --

               TO A PRIVATE HALLWAY

               with three doors. Gabriel stops at the first, grips his gun --

                                     GABRIEL
                         Video room, video room --

               -- and swings open a closet bathroom. He frowns, confused. 
               Jumps to the second door --

                                     GABRIEL
                         Map said video room --

               -- and swings open a storage closet. Gabriel grumbles, leaps 
               to the third door and flings it open,

                                     GABRIEL
                         Map said goddamn video room!

               TO REVEAL THE MAIN SECURITY AREA

               -- with two Guards sitting at their posts, and Jack Bangs, 
               the Security Boss and the Video Guard in the doorway to the 
               video room. Which is on the far opposite side of the space.

               As they turn to see the furious Santa Claus with the AK-47 --

                                     GABRIEL
                         WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON??!!!

               -- as he SPRAYS the ceiling with GUNFIRE.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR

               Where the RIFLE sounds, just as Jumpy grips his bucket of 
               quarters at the cashier's cage and wheels --

               -- throwing a fragmentation grenade's worth of quarters at 
               the two Cashiers! Bits Of metal flying between the bars. 
               They SCREAM, stepping backwards in defense --

               -- and Jumpy whips a sawed-off shotgun from his coat --

                                     JUMPY
                         Step BACK from the desks!

               AT THE BLACKJACK

               The five guards wrestling Rudy spin and scramble, pulling 
               pistols from shoulder holsters as --

               MERLIN

               CHARGES through the casino entrance, shotgun held --

                                     MERLIN
                         DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!!!

                              (from the floor)
                         DROP THE GUNS! NOW!

               But the guards don't. Whirling on Merlin --

               -- who OPENS FIRE, BLASTING two of the guards off their feet. 
               Rudy stays on the ground, covering his head, holding the 
               petrified Old Timer down --

               -- as the other three guards FIRE back, forcing Merlin to 
               race behind the slots. BULLETS rip into slot machines --

               -- as GUNSHOTS ring out from the casino restaurant. Two of 
               the Guards spin to look behind them as --

               -- PUG storms in, contorted glee, twin pistols BLAZING, 
               popping a steel flurry into an outgunned Guard.

               Merlin spins from hiding behind the slots. He and Pug both 
               OPEN FIRE, blowing away the two remaining men from both sides.

               One of the guards falls in front of Rudy, gun in hand --

               -- but as Rudy-reaches for the guy's pistol --

                                     MERLIN
                         Hold it right there, Nick. Your squirt 
                         gun's all you need.

               Merlin steps to him, gun aimed. He and Pug collect the Guards, 
               weapons.

                                     MERLIN
                         Cover 'em.

               Rudy gets to his feet, pulls the water pistol from his pocket.

               Moves to round up the Old Timer, the waitress, the Poker 
               Players and the Fat Slots Women.

                                     RUDY
                         Sorry, guys. But what the hell were 
                         you doing here an Christmas Eve 
                         anyway.

               INT. SECURITY LEVEL

               The two Guards lie on the floor, with Security Boss and Video 
               Guard. And the ruined Jack Bangs.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         No... not here... please... mister...

               Gabriel storms to the video room's doorway. Slams a new clip.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         Mister. I'm begging, 'kay? I'm 
                         begging. This is not some card club, 
                         'kay? This is the Tomahawk. We're an 
                         international gaming destination. 
                         We're in guidebooks. You can't do 
                         this... you can't do this to me...

                                     GABRIEL
                         Show's over.

               He OPENS FIRE, BLOWING AWAY the wall of monitors and VCR's 
               recording the robbery. SPARKS and METAL fly.

               EXT. PARKING LOT

               Ashley waits in the Nova, checking her watch. Behind her a 
               RED WRANGLER rolls in and parks. A FIRE CHIEF and his DEPUTY, 
               just off-duty, stroll toward the casino, laughing.

               Ashley sinks low, panicked. Presses her HORN. The firemen 
               spin around but don't see her. They shrug. Keep walking.

               INT. TOMAHAWK

               Rudy forces the gamblers and employees behind the bar. Onto 
               the floor with Bear the Bartender, whispering hard:

                                     RUDY
                         Get down and stay down, and you're 
                         gonna be fine. Just don't do anything. 
                         My friends are disturbed --

               The hostages do as told. Rudy breathes relief, squirt gun in 
               hand. And then stares at the array of bottles around him.

               IN THE CASHIER'S CAGE

               Merlin and Pug force the cashiers to the floor:

                                     PUG
                         What's the security code to the Count 
                         Room?

                                     CASHIER #1
                         Security code? What security code?  
                         You just use a key!

                                     PUG
                         NICK SAID SECURITY CODE!

                                     CASHIER #1
                         Who's Nick?!

               Pug bangs the guy's head off the floor, stalks to the Count 
               Room door. Just a key lock. Pug BLOWS it away with his guns, 
               kicks the door open --

               -- and gets SHOT TO HELL by three COUNT MEN inside, pistols 
               blazing! Pug puppets, dead. A wad of chaw hits the ceiling.

               Stunned Merlin FIRES BACK.

               EXT. PARKING LOT

               -- as the Firemen hear the GUNFIRE, pulling holstered pistols --

               INT. TOMAHAWK

               -- while Merlin dives out of the cage, joining Jumpy, taking 
               cover as the Count Men FIRE AWAY --

               -- as Rudy scrambles back from the bar --

                                     MERLIN
                         You said no GUNS in there! NO GUNS!

               Merlin and Jumpy leap up, GUNS BLAZING, firing through the 
               cage bars at the Count Men. Killing all three just as --

               THE OFF-DUTY FIREMEN

               storm through the doors, pistols ready --

                                     FIREMEN
                         DROP IT! DROP THE GUNS!

               Merlin and Jumpy are caught. Trade a look. And let their 
               weapons fall, turning just as --

               THE CHEVY NOVA

               CRASHES through the casino doors, MOWING DOWN the firemen!

               The car SLAMS inside, crashing into slot machines. The slots 
               send SPARKS showering into the air. Which set off the casino 
               floor's SPRINKLERS. The room fills with watery spray.

               Ashley swiftly climbs out of the mangled vehicle. Rudy stares 
               darkly at her. She knows he knows. And she doesn't care.

                                     ASHLEY
                              (wild-eyed)
                         WHERE'S THE FUCKING CASH, NICK!

                                     RUDY
                         Yeah. That's love.

               She storms on by. The slots pay off behind her.

               INT. COUNT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

               Jumpy, Merlin, Ashley and Rudy step inside the Count Room. 
               There are stacks and stacks of bills.

               Ashley smiles wide, throws Jumpy three laundry sacks.

                                     ASHLEY
                         MOVE, MOVE, MOVE!

               Merlin, meanwhile, slams Rudy against the wall:

                                     MERLIN
                         You knew there were guns in here!

                                     RUDY
                         Merlin, I didn't know --

                                     MERLIN
                         You got Pug killed! You tried to get 
                         ME killed! You just lost your Get-
                         Outta-Jail-Free --

                                     RUDY
                         I promise you, I didn't know!

               As Merlin puts a gun to Rudyls head --

                                     GABRIEL (O.S.)
                              (over casino speakers)
                         Santa Claus, Santa Claus, and Santa 
                         Claus... would you please bring our... 
                         mapmaker... to the security level?

               Merlin stares daggers at Rudy. Shoves the gun away.

               INT. JACK BANGS' OFFICE - NIGHT

               Gabriel stands at the windows overlooking the watery carnage. 
               The taped jingle of slots still plays.

               Poor Jack Bangs lies on his desk, beaten to a pulp. Blood 
               runs down his face and shark suit. Tears and shock:

                                     JACK BANGS
                         I can't go back to Vegas... I can't... 
                         go back...

                                     JUMPY (O.S.)
                         What the hell is with this place?  
                         Thought the video room was back there --

               Merlin and Jumpy lead Rudy in. Ashley follows. They carry 
               bulging money sacks. Gabriel stares Rudy down.

                                     GABRIEL
                         I told you not to fuck us with that 
                         map, Nick. I told you not to, and 
                         you did. How am I s'posed to keep my 
                         promises now?
                              (Ashley joins him)
                         How's she s'posed to keep hers?

               He kisses her hard. Sloppy. Grins.

               Then points to Jack Bangs:

                                     GABRIEL
                         He won't tell us where it is. The 
                         Powwow Safe.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         I don't know... what you're...

               Gabriel hammers him with the butt of his rifle. CRACK.

                                     GABRIEL
                         THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW 
                         SAFE!

                                     JACK BANGS
                         What... Powwow...

                                     GABRIEL
                         The Powwow Safe where you steal your 
                         money! Where you cheat your Indians!

                                     JACK BANGS
                         I don't steal any --

               Gabriel CRACKS him again. And again. Rudy winces. Gabriel 
               grabs Rudy, pulls him over.

                                     GABRIEL
                         We KNOW about the Powwow Safe! We 
                         KNOW it's in here! We KNOW how you 
                         work! Because WE know who's worked 
                         for you!
                              (smiles)
                         Remember a guy named Nick Mason!?  A 
                         security guard named Nick Mason!?

               Gabriel pushes Rudy's head toward the desk. Jack Bangs, 
               drooling blood, eyes swollen, turns his face to see.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         Nick... Mason... ?

               Jack Bangs stares at Rudy. Rudy stares back.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         ...so where is he?

                                     GABRIEL
                              (laughs, mocking)
                         Where is he?! Where is he?!

                                     JACK BANGS
                         He's not Nick Mason...

               The smile fades from Gabriel's face.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         Nick Mason... worked for me two years 
                         ago. This man...
                              (a spark of recognition)
                         ...he's some cowboy...

               Gabriel grabs Rudy, slams him against a wall. He glares at 
               Ashley for answers. She stares in disbelief.

               Rudy meets her eyes.

                                     RUDY
                         Fucked the wrong guy, Ashley.
                              (shrugs)
                         Story of your life.

               BACK TO GABRIEL:

                                     RUDY
                         I did time with Nick Mason, Monster.  
                         Told you that from the start.

               Ashley's putting it all together...

                                     ASHLEY
                         You... you... YOU --

                                     RUDY
                         We still gonna spend Christmas 
                         together?

               Ashley CHARGES him. Gabriel stops her; Merlin and Jumpy help 
               hold her back. Gabriel spins on Rudy with his rifle:

                                     GABRIEL
                         You are lucky, convict. You're 
                         spending Christmas with the birthday 
                         boy himself --

                                     RUDY
                         Hey! HEY! THERE IS A POWWOW SAFE!

               Gabriel hesitates. Doesn't fire.

                                     RUDY
                         I did time with Nick Mason, remember?  
                         I knew he worked here, didn't I!?  
                         Well, some shit he told me!

               Rudy steels himself for the shot. It still doesn't come.

                                     RUDY
                         Nick told me his manager kept a safe 
                         in his office, his stealing safe. 
                         His Powwow Safe. I swear, please...  
                         Nick told me.
                              (looks to Jack Bangs)
                         Behind the liquor cabinet.

               Jack Bangs dully meets Rudy's eyes.

               Gabriel steps to the liquor cabinet, feels at the shelves. 
               They split in the middle. And there is a combination safe 
               mounted in the back. Gabriel turns to Jack Bangs:

                                     GABRIEL
                         Open it.

               He pulls him off the desk. Jack Bangs wavers, struggling. He 
               looks at Gabriel. Then at Rudy.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         I can't go back to Vegas...

                                     GABRIEL
                         OPEN IT!!!

               Jack Bangs steps to the safe. Spins the lock. Spins back. 
               Spins forward. Click. Jack Bangs looks at Rudy.

                                     RUDY
                              (nods)
                         Pow. Wow.

               And Jack Bangs opens it --

               -- reaching inside in the same swift motion, so that as the 
               safe swings open to reveal it's a rack of WEAPONS that lies 
               inside, Jack Bangs already has an Uzi in hand --

                                     JACK BANGS
                         VEEEEGGGGAAAASSSS!!!

               BULLETS as he turns back to the room --

               -- sending Gabriel, Ashley, and Merlin diving for the floor! 
               Jumpy can't get down, as BULLETS riddle him dead --

               -- and BLOW OUT the smoked windows overlooking the casino --

               Jack Bangs keeps turning in a madman's circle --

               -- BLOWING OUT the windows to the parking lot, shattering 
               the liquor, sending Rudy scrambling under his desk --

                                     JACK BANGS
                         I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK! 
                         I CAN'T! GO BACK!

                                     GABRIEL
                         GO!!!

               He and Ashley both scramble for the windows, jumping out 
               with two of the money sacks --

               TO THE CASINO FLOOR

               -- and landing on poker tables below, overturning them --

               Jack Bangs keeps FIRING, into the casino, SHREDDING the tables 
               but missing Gabriel and Ashley -- as he JUMPS right after 
               them.

               BACK IN BANGS' OFFICE

               Merlin scrambles to his feet, whirling with his gun, looking 
               for Rudy --

               -- just as Rudy slams into him. Merlin's SHOT hits the 
               ceiling.

               The two of them CRASH down, wrestling and rolling toward the 
               parking lot window. Two guns spill to the floor. Rudy grabs 
               one, just as Merlin kicks out, leaping up --

               -- and freezes, seeing Rudy's got a pistol on him.

               Before Merlin can make a move, Rudy fires --

               -- and a thin stream of water shoots out. Leaving a stain on 
               his shirt. It's the water pistol. Rudy stares blankly.

               As Merlin swiftly snatches the second gun, a real gun, off 
               the floor. Rudy's dead to rights.

                                     MERLIN
                         Hell. I'm gonna take pleasure in 
                         this...

               With the gun on Rudy, Merlin finds a cigarette in his pockets.

               Pops it between his lips, raises a lighter's flame --

               -- and hesitates. Sniffing the air. Looking down.

               At the stain on his shirt. His lighter still lit --

                                     RUDY
                         Me too.

               -- and Rudy fires the water pistol again, this time catching 
               Merlin's lighter, which turns the stream into a ARC OF FIRE! 
               He's filled alcohol in the gun!

               FLAMING LIQUOR shoots into Merlin's face and eyes. He drops 
               the handgun. Rudy keeps squeezing the squirt gun, spreading 
               the fire down his neck and chest. Merlin howls wildly --

               -- and staggers back, blind and helpless, pinwheeling himself --

               OUT THE PARKING LOT WINDOW

               -- and CRASHING down on the hood of a Pontiac, head through 
               the windshield, boots on the bumper, dead. Flames flickering.

                                     RUDY
                         Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

               IN THE CASINO

               Gabriel and Ashley have scrambled to the Nova, tumbling in 
               with the money sacks. Jack Bangs gets up, stalking toward 
               them, still FIRING and babbling.

               Gabriel FIRES back, hitting Bangs in the chest. He staggers, 
               but stays upright. His bullets RIDDLE the car, shattering 
               the windshield, but Gabriel and Ashley keep their heads down, 
               slamming it into reverse --

               -- and burning rubber backwards out the casino entrance, 
               into the parking lot, and speeding out of sight.

               Jack Bangs stops shooting.

               He staggers back toward the bar, totters there, and turns, 
               gun still raised.

               Rudy stands at the base of the stairs to the security level. 
               He puts his hands up, until he sees the dying look in Bangs, 
               face. The uzi drops to the ground.

               A silence. Even the slots have stopped.

                                     RUDY
                         I'm sorry.

               Jack Bangs stares blankly. Surveys the wreckage of his poor 
               man's empire. And gives a small shrug.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         That's why they call it gambling.

               He slumps against the bar and hits the floor. Dead.

               EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Rudy ambles out into the snowy night. The lot is quiet. He 
               takes a few wary steps toward the road --

               -- and hears a CLICK. He turns to see Ashley standing behind 
               him, with a gun. Shaking her pretty head.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Your turn.

               Rudy shuts his eyes for the end.

               EXT. RESERVATION ROAD - NIGHT

               The Nova drives up a ramp into the back of the truck, in 
               reverse. Gabriel gets out, pulls shut the trailer. Ashley 
               collects the hazard triangles. They hurry to the cab.

               EXT. MICHIGAN HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               The Motor City monster storms through the night, passing a 
               couple POLICE CARS, sirens wailing, speeding the other way.

               INT. GABRIEL'S RIG

               Gabriel and Ashley inside, with the money sacks:

                                     GABRIEL
                         With the wrong fucking guy! We took 
                         the place down with the wrong fucking 
                         guy! Is that Christmas?! Huh?! Is 
                         that Christmas?!

               He grabs Ashley, kisses her wildly. Then turns back --

               TO THE SLEEPER COMPARTMENT

               Where Rudy lies sideways, hands bound with his Santa belt.

                                     GABRIEL
                         God bless us every one...

               EXT. RIDGESIDE ROAD - NIGHT

               A winding two-lane road, overlooking a small ravine at a 
               grassy overlook. The road is dusted with snow; there's been 
               no traffic here for awhile.

               The Motor City Monster steams to a stop beyond the overlook. 
               Then starts backing up, such that the gate of the trailer is 
               fifteen feet from the edge of the ridge.

               A hundred-foot drop into the ravine below.

               Gabriel and Ashley pile out of the cab. They lift the trailer 
               gate, extend the tire ramps. The ramps run from the trailer 
               to five feet away from, the ravine drop.

               IN THE CAB

               Gabriel pulls Rudy out of the sleeper. Marches him back --

               TO THE RAVINE'S EDGE

               -- and gives him a look. Forces him to his knees. Ashley is 
               in the truck trailer, splashing the inside of the Nova with 
               a can of gasoline.

                                     GABRIEL
                         You almost got away with it, Santa. 
                         Got outta the Tomahawk, got to your 
                         car, got halfway to Canada till you 
                         caught some ice in the road. By the 
                         time you hit bottom down there, whole 
                         car was burning like a comet.  Musta 
                         burned up all that money too.

               Rudy glances to the trailer. Ashley tosses a couple handfuls 
               of bills into the car.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Buncha guys in red suits busted in, 
                         they'll say. Started shooting. They 
                         won't be able to remember... if it 
                         was three, or four... or five. Four 
                         dead Santas and some burned-up cash. 
                         Merry Christmas, The End.

                                     RUDY
                         Was it your plan, Monster? Or was it 
                         hers.

               Gabriel smiles at him.

                                     GABRIEL
                         She told me 'bout the convict 
                         magazines. Had to figure there'd be 
                         some boys in the pen with some useful 
                         knowledge. With nobody to talk to. 
                         Nobody to listen. So we stocked up 
                         on stationery.

               Ashley hops down. Gabriel puts an arm around her.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Hard life being a trucker's girl.

               Rudy eyes Ashley. She stares darkly back.

                                     RUDY
                         I saved your life.

                                     ASHLEY
                         You shouldn't have.

                                     RUDY
                         He did love you, you know. Nick. He 
                         did love you.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Who wouldn't.

               So cold. But Rudy doesn't pause.

                                     RUDY
                         Maybe this is where you wanted him, 
                         Ashley. At the bottom of a ravine, 
                         dead as ice with a burnt-up heart. 
                         Maybe. But it didn't happen. 'Cause 
                         what you did for him was make him 
                         the happiest held ever been. You 
                         showed him hope and taught him mercy.  
                         And he died a peaceful man. You wanted 
                         to destroy some convict... and all 
                         you did was save his soul. Remember 
                         that. Love your money and remember 
                         that.

               Ashley shivers, a touch shaken. But steels herself:

                                     ASHLEY
                         Merry Christmas, Rudy.

                                     RUDY
                         I'm glad it was me.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Merry Christmas.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Get in the car.

               Gabriel hauls him up. Marches him to the trailer. Rudy stops 
               at the ramp. Gabriel pushes. Rudy doesn't move.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Get in the CAR!

                                     RUDY
                         How'd you know my name...

               He turns back to Ashley.

                                     ASHLEY
                         What?

                                     RUDY
                         Rudy. How'd you know my name?

                                     ASHLEY
                         What are you talking about?

               Rudy looks at Gabriel. He's frowning. To Ashley:

                                     RUDY
                         You said Merry Christmas, Rudy.

                                     ASHLEY
                         I... you told me your name was Rudy. 
                         You told me a million times, back in 
                         the truck, telling me you weren't 
                         Nick --

                                     RUDY
                         No --

                                     ASHLEY
                         You were screaming you weren't Nick! 
                         And we just didn't fucking believe 
                         you!

                                     RUDY
                         But I never said Rudy.

                                     ASHLEY
                         You said it a million times!

                                     RUDY
                         I never told you my name.

               He stares her down. Then stares at Gabriel.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Ash?

                                     RUDY
                         How'd you know my name was Rudy.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Ash?

                                     RUDY
                         How'd you know my name.

               Ashley stares daggers. Shakes her head ruefully --

                                     ASHLEY
                         Men.

               -- and pulls a handgun, SHOOTING Gabriel in the heart.

               Gabriel falls to his knees in the snow, his mouth a ring of 
               shock. Blood spurts through his red coat. He stares at Ashley, 
               incredulous.

               She steps forward and PUTS another bullet in his neck. Gabriel 
               falls still.

               Ashley's breath frosts in the cold.

               Rudy watches her. Finally, she meets Rudy's eyes. They stare 
               each other down for a long moment, before:

                                     RUDY
                         Where is he.

               A silence.

               No one moves.

               And finally, the CRUNCH of footsteps from around the side of 
               the trailer. And WHISTLING. "Silver Bells."

               A shadow moves across the snow behind the trailer, and soon 
               steps into Rudy and Ashley's view.

               It's Nick Mason.

               Alive and well.

                                     NICK
                         Merry Christmas, Rudy.

               Ashley smiles. Her muscles-and-mustache man pen pal is here.

                                     NICK
                         I missed you, beautiful.

                                     ASHLEY
                         I missed you too, Nicky baby.

               They share a passionate kiss. Ashley malts at the sight of 
               him, embracing happily. Then turns to Rudy:

                                     ASHLEY
                         For your information. I never fuck 
                         the wrong guy.

               Rudy just stands there, his mind playing catch-up.

                                     NICK
                         Oh, hey. Have you two been properly 
                         introduced? Sweetness, this is Rudy 
                         Duncan, I did almost a year with him 
                         in the Mountain. Read him all your 
                         letters, talked about you all the 
                         time, made him feel like he really 
                         knew you.
                              (turns to Rudy)
                         My friend... wantcha to meet Millie 
                         Bobek. 'Member Millie Bobek, dontcha? 
                         My girlfriend fore I went in? Worked 
                         at that bar in Motor City, where I 
                         manslaughtered that guy? Hell. Didn't 
                         talk about her much once the Ashley 
                         letters started coming, I guess.

               Rudy doesn't notice it's started to snow.

                                     NICK
                         Millie here used to serve drinks to 
                         these gunrunning truckers, real big 
                         talkers, talking bout a real score 
                         one day. I was in the Mountain, man, 
                         what the hell, why not let her get 
                         friendly with 'em? Let her tell 'em 
                         an idea she had, 'bout writing guys 
                         in prison. Getting one who could 
                         show 'em a sure thing.

                                     RUDY
                         She set them up. All of them.

                                     NICK
                         Why not have her pretend to find me?  
                         Pretend to write me and reel me in?  
                         Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose 
                         as some sister of his named Ashley?

                                     RUDY
                         And you set me up.

                                     NICK
                         Always wanted to rob that casino, 
                         Rudy. Way back when I worked there.  
                         What better way than to get some 
                         guys to rob it for me.

               Nick shrugs. Prods Rudy up the ramp. Into the trailer:

                                     NICK
                         Paid the Alamo ten bucks to put the 
                         shiv in me. He's a lifer, what does 
                         he care. Paid a hospital guard fifty 
                         to put out the story I was dead. 
                         Once the wound healed up...
                              (notes cash-sacks)
                         Got out of the Mountain this morning.  
                         And tonight I'm a rich man.

                                     RUDY
                         How'd you know I'd do it.

                                     NICK
                         Do what?

                                     RUDY
                         Walk outta there and tell her I was 
                         you.

               Nick looks back at Ashley.

                                     NICK
                         Because every time I read her letters, 
                         Rudy... you listened.
                              (to Ashley)
                         Keep your gun on him.

               Nick forces Rudy inside, unties the belt from his wrists and 
               lashes them to the bottom of the steering wheel.

                                     NICK
                         Five Santas walked into that Tomahawk, 
                         Rudy. That's what the witnesses'll 
                         say. So we gotta have five Santas 
                         not walk out. Gotta have five...
                              (working)
                         This'll burn right away... in the 
                         fire...

               Nick gets Rudy's wrists locked to the wheel. He laughs.

                                     NICK
                         Hell, you never needed to convince 
                         Ashley you were me. Just the dumb 
                         fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked 
                         enough about the Tomahawk in the pen 
                         for you to get by --

                                     RUDY
                         Talked about the old man's weapons 
                         stash, probably forgot I'd remember

                                     NICK
                         Hm. Well. They'd have killed you if 
                         you weren't me, Rudy. We knew you'd 
                         start convincing 'em soon enough.

               Nick slams the car door, locking Rudy in.

                                     NICK
                         They had the weapons and the 
                         willpower. We just gave them their 
                         inside man.

                                     RUDY
                         You gave them me.

                                     NICK
                         I gave them me.
                              (shrugs, smiles)
                         Said some nice things about me, Rudy. 
                         I appreciate it. But don't worry. I 
                         do love her. And she loves me. You 
                         had that right all along.

               Nick reaches across him, releases the brake. Puts the car 
               into "Drive." Turns to Ashley:

                                     NICK
                         Sweetness! Let's light up the tree!

               Ashley steps toward the ramp, taking out a matchbook. Nick 
               steps further into the trailer, to the back of the Nova.

               IN THE CAR

               Rudy immediately wriggles his hands, trying to touch his 
               wrists together. Trying to press together the white cuffs of 
               his Santa suit. Trying to get the right pressure point --

               -- as a BLADE suddenly springs out of the cuff! The 
               switchblade he'd stolen from the Blazer -- it's lashed to 
               his right wrist!

               Rudy starts sawing his wrist back and forth, cutting through 
               the Santa belt --

               -- his hands at the bottom of the wheel, too low for either 
               Ashley or Nick to see --

               IN THE TRAILER

               Ashley is at the hood of the car, LIGHTING her match. Nick 
               is at the back bumper, ready to push it down the ramp --

                                     NICK
                         Goodbye, Rudy! Nice spending time 
                         with you!

               IN THE CAR

               The belt breaks! Rudy snaps his hands free! But instead of 
               trying to escape, he reaches under the steering column, 
               RIPPING its panel away and pulling wires free!

               As Ashley tosses her match onto the hood, and FIRE races 
               over the body of the car, TONGUES racing inside, over the 
               dash, over the seats, lapping at Rudy --

               -- who ducks his head beneath the wheel, frantic to locate 
               the right leads --

               IN THE TRAILER

               Ashley jumps out of the way, to the snow. Nick pushes the 
               flaming car to the trailer's edge --

               -- starting on down the ramp, the ravine ahead --

               -- and as gravity starts to take the metal bonfire --

               IN THE CAR

               Rudy sparks two wires together, FLAMES eating at him --

                                     RUDY
                         LIKE RIDING A BIKE, LIKE RIDING A 
                         BIKE, LIKE RIDING A BIIIIIKE!

               -- and the ENGINE IGNITES!

               Rudy slams the gearshift into "Reverse", grabs the wheel and 
               looks over his shoulder at shocked Nick behind him --

                                     RUDY
                         RULE ONE! NEVER PUT A CAR THIEF BEHIND 
                         THE WHEEL!

               -- and SLAMS the accelerator.

               ON FULL SCENE

               As the burning Nova races backwards up the ramp, and back 
               into the trailer --

               Terrified Nick turns to run but there's nowhere to go --

               -- and the car SLAMS into the trailer's back, CRUSHING Nick's 
               legs between metal and metal!

                                     ASHLEY
                         NOOOOOOO!!!

               Then Rudy faces front, pounds the shift into "Drive."

                                     RUDY
                         RULE TWO!

               Ashley stands at the bottom of the ramp, vengeance and rage. 
               She grabs her handgun, OPENS FIRE --

               -- and Rudy SLAMS the gas again, shooting down the ramp --

               -- as he flings open the car door, dives and rolls --

               -- while the burning Nova COLLIDES with Ashley, throwing her 
               onto the hood, and sending the tandem inferno speeding off 
               the ridgetop --

               -- arcing slowly as it PLUMMETS into the ravine, a smoking, 
               blazing shooting star with a woman's figure hanging on.

               The shooting star hits Earth and explodes.

                                                          SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. CASINO/EXT. SNOWY ROAD - MONTAGE

               The same four shots that opened the film. The Santa on the 
               floor of the cage (Pug), the Santa on the hood of the car 
               (Merlin), the Santa in the hallway (Jumpy).

               And the Santa lying face-down on the snowy road. Gabriel.

               EXT. RAVINE'S EDGE - SAME

               The last of the opening images. Rudy's motionless Santa 
               figure, upside-down on the snowy incline, bits of his suit 
               still aflame. He opens his eyes.

               ANGLE ON SNOWY ROAD

               Rudy staggers to his feet. Battered and dazed. Looks at 
               Gabriel's body. Then looks to the trailer.

               Inside, Nick is still alive, bones broken from the waist 
               down.

               He's mumbling madly, staring at the ceiling:

                                     NICK
                         ...Rudy... help me... Rudy...

               Rudy climbs the tire ramp. And pulls the trailer gate shut.

               He climbs into the rig's cab. Starts the engine. Puts the 
               truck in reverse, taps the accelerator and hops out.

                                     NICK (O.S.)
                         ...Rudy! Rudy! HELP ME!!!

               The truck rolls backwards. And into the ravine.

               Rudy listens to its TUMBLING SOUNDS all the way to the bottom. 
               He then looks up the road one way. Then the other.

               And notices the two money sacks sitting in the snow.

               He stares at them.

               A long time.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. RUDY'S JOURNEY - MONTAGE - NIGHT/DAY

               In his burnt and battered Santa suit, Rudy's figure trudges 
               the snowy night. Two sacks over his shoulder. walking empty 
               roads and highways. And passing a roadsign that reads "Sidnaw -- 
               35 Miles."

               He passes rural roads and driveways, and every time he comes 
               across a mailbox... he puts a stack of cash inside. On the 
               soundtrack, the STRINGS and RUM-PUM-PUM-PUMS of "The Little 
               Drummer Boy" start to rise --

               With snow falling, he passes a new sign: "Sidnaw -- 27 Miles."

               With the sun rising, a PAIR OF CHILDREN huddle at a window, 
               seeing the man in the Santa suit at the end of their driveway. 
               Giving them something from his sack and ambling on.

               -- and we follow Rudy's march, stuffing presents into 
               mailboxes. At every-stop on the way.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. A SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

               A cul-de-sac of Norman Rockwell Michigan homes. Graced with 
               pines and a pristine snowfall. Christmas trees in windows, 
               lights on inside, figures of FAMILIES in holiday gear.

               No one noticing the man in the Santa suit, his sacks long 
               gone, walking up the road.

               EXT./INT. FIFTIES-ERA HOME - DAY

               At cul-de-sac's end. Where a blackened red cuff KNOCKS.

               After a moment, the door opens to reveal a smiling MOTHER 
               and FATHER in their sixties. There's a party going on inside; 
               a dining table visible beyond them.

               The Mother and Father's smiles disappear. Shock. Concern.

                                     MOTHER
                         Rudy...? Rudy?

                                     FATHER
                         Son? Is... is that you...?

               The Santa Claus shuffles inside, right past them.

               The Santa Claus sleepwalks straight for the dining room, 
               finding a dozen RELATIVES, laughing and eating. A table laden 
               with turkey and stuffing, gravy and cranberry, wassail and 
               wine.

               The relatives stop still. The room goes silent.

               The Santa Claus sits down at the head of the table.

               Yes, it's Rudy.

               Without a word, he stares at the food before him. And takes 
               a plate. He stacks it with meat and dressing and trimmings, 
               and sets it in front of him.

               And digs in. Stuffing his face in silence.

               His Mother and Father return to the dining room, gaping. The 
               other relatives look likewise.

               All staring at Rudy.

               Then, while he eats, without another sound...

               ...the Mother takes her seat at the table...

               ...and the Father pulls up another chair.

               They touch hands privately, and turn back to their plates.

               There's a CLANK of silverware, a SCRAPE of china, a CLINK of 
               glass, and one-by-one, the relatives resume their meals.  
               CONVERSATION picks up where it left off, SMILES return to 
               the table, LAUGHTER slowly rises in the room.

               There is Mr. Duncan and Mrs. Duncan, Aunt Lisbeth and Uncle 
               Ray, Aunt Mary and Uncle Pete, toddler Sasha and teenage 
               Sam, brother Mike and his girlfriend Jill, sister Stacy and 
               her husband Bill, Grandpa Walter, little Wendy Sue...

               ...and at the head of the table...

               Rudy Duncan.

               Home for Christmas.

               CUT TO BLACK.

                                         THE END

                                 RESERVOIR DOGS

1      INT. UNCLE BOB'S PANCAKE HOUSE - MORNING

       Eight men dressed in BLACK SUITS, sit around a table at a
       breakfast cafe.  They are MR. WHITE, MR. PINK, MR. BLUE,
       MR. BLONDE, MR. ORANGE, MR. BROWN, NICE GUY EDDIE CABOT,
       and the big boss, JOE CABOT.  Most are finished eating and
       are enjoying coffee and conversation.  Joe flips through a
       small address book.  Mr. Pink is telling a long and
       involved story about Madonna.

                              MR. PINK 
                 "Like a Virgin" is all about a
                 girl who digs a guy with a big
                 dick.  The whole song is a
                 metaphor for big dicks.

                              MR. BLUE
                 No it's not.  It's about a girl
                 who is very vulnerable and she's
                 been fucked over a few times.
                 Then she meets some guy who's
                 really sensitive--

                              MR. PINK
                 --Whoa...whoa...time out Greenbay.
                 Tell that bullshit to the
                 tourists.

                              JOE
                         (looking through his
                          address book)
                 Toby...who the fuck is Toby?
                 Toby...Toby...think...think...
                 think...

                              MR. PINK
                 It's not about a nice girl who
                 meets a sensitive boy.  Now
                 granted that's what "True Blue" is
                 about, no argument about that.

                              MR. ORANGE
                 Which one is "True Blue?"

                              NICE GUY EDDIE
                 You don't remember "True Blue?"
                 That was a big ass hit for
                 Madonna.  Shit, I don't even
                 follow this Tops In Pops shit, and
                 I've at least heard of "True
                 Blue."

                              MR. ORANGE
                 Look, asshole, I didn't say I
                 ain't heard of it.  All I asked
                 was how does it go?  Excuse me
                 for not being the world's biggest
                 Madonna fan.

                              MR. BROWN
                 I hate Madonna.

                              MR. BLUE
                 I like her early stuff.  You know,
                 "Lucky Star," "Borderline" - but
                 once she got into her "Papa Don't
                 Preach" phase, I don't know, I
                 tuned out.

                              MR. PINK
                 Hey, fuck all that, I'm
                 making a point here.  You're gonna
                 make me lose my train
                 of thought.

                              JOE
                 Oh fuck, Toby's that little china
                 girl.

                              MR. WHITE
                 What's that?

                              JOE
                 I found this old address book in a
                 jacket I ain't worn in a coon's
                 age.  Toby what?  What the fuck
                 was her last name?

                              MR. PINK
                 Where was I?

                              MR. ORANGE
                 You said "True Blue" was about a
                 nice girl who finds a sensitive
                 fella.  But "Like a Virgin" was a
                 metaphor for big dicks.

                              MR. PINK
                 Let me tell ya what "Like a
                 Virgin"'s about.  It's about some
                 cooze who's a regular fuck
                 machine.
                 I mean all the time, morning, day,
                 night, afternoon, dick, dick,
                 dick, dick, dick,
                 dick, dick, dick, dick, dick,
                 dick.

                              MR. BLUE
                 How many dicks was that?

                              MR. WHITE
                 A lot.

                              MR. PINK
                 Then one day she meets a John
                 Holmes motherfucker, and it's
                 like, whoa baby.  This mother
                 fucker's like Charles Bronson in
                 "The Great Escape."  He's diggin
                 tunnels.  Now she's gettin this
                 serious dick action, she's feelin
                 something she ain't felt since
                 forever.  Pain.

                              JOE
                 Chew?  Toby Chew?  No.

                              MR. PINK
                 It hurts.  It hurts her.  It
                 shouldn't hurt.  Her pussy should
                 be Bubble-Yum by now.  But when
                 this cat fucks her, it hurts.  It
                 hurts like the first time.  The
                 pain is reminding a fuck machine
                 what is was like to be a virgin.
                 Hence, "Like a Virgin."

       The fellas crack up.

                              JOE
                 Wong?

                              MR. PINK
                 Fuck you, wrong.  I'm right!  What
                 the fuck do you know about it
                 anyway?  You're still listening to
                 Jerry-fucking-Vale.

                              JOE
                 Not wrong, dumb ass, Wong!  You
                 know, like the Chinese name?

       Mr. White snatches the address book from Joe's hand.  They
       fight, but they're not really mad at each other.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Give me this fucking thing.

                              JOE
                 What the fuck do you think you're
                 doin?  Give me my book back!

                              MR. WHITE
                 I'm sick of fuckin hearin it Joe,
                 I'll give it back when we leave.

                              JOE
                 Whaddaya mean, give it to me when
                 we leave, give it back now.

                              MR. WHITE
                 For the past fifteen minutes now,
                 you've just been droning on with
                 names.  "Toby...Toby...Toby...
                 Toby Wong...Toby Wong...Toby
                 Chung...fuckin Charlie Chan."  I
                 got Madonna's big dick outta my
                 right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-
                 know-what, outta my left.

                              JOE
                 What do you care?

                              MR. WHITE
                 When you're annoying as hell, I
                 care a lot.

                              JOE
                 Give me my book.

                              MR. WHITE
                 You gonna put it away?

                              JOE
                 I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do
                 with it.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Well, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna
                 have to keep it.

                              MR. BLONDE
                 Joe, you want me to shoot him for
                 you?

                              MR. WHITE
                 Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you
                 better wake up and apologize.

                              NICE GUY EDDIE
                 Have you guys been listening to K-
                 BILLY's super sounds of the
                 seventies weekend?

                              MR. PINK
                 Yeah, it's fuckin great isn't it?

                              NICE GUY EDDIE
                 Can you believe the songs they
                 been playin?

                              MR. PINK
                 No, I can't.  You know what I
                 heard the other day?  "Heartbeat -
                 It's Lovebeat," by little Tony
                 DeFranco and the DeFranco Family.
                 I haven't heard that since I was
                 in fifth fuckin grade.

                              NICE GUY EDDIE
                 When I was coming down here, I was
                 playin it.  And "The Night the
                 Lights Went Out in Georgia" came
                 on.  Now I ain't heard that song
                 since it was big, but when it was
                 big, I heard it a million-
                 trillion times.  I'm listening to
                 it this morning, and this was the
                 first time I ever realized that
                 the lady singing the song, was the
                 one who killed Andy.

                              MR. BLUE
                 You didn't know Vicki Lawrence
                 killed the guy?

                              NICE GUY EDDIE
                 I thought the cheatin wife shot
                 Andy.

                              MR. BLONDE
                 They say it in the song.

                              NICE GUY EDDIE
                 I know, I heard it.  I musta zoned
                 out whenever that part came on
                 before.  I thought when she said
                 that little sister stuff, she was
                 talkin about her sister- in-law,
                 the cheatin wife.

                              JOE
                 No, she did it.  She killed the
                 cheatin wife, too.

                              MR. PINK
                 You know the part in "Gypsies,
                 Tramps and Theives," when she says
                 "Poppa woulda shot his if he knew
                 what he'd done?"  I could never
                 figure out what he did.

       The table laughs.  The WAITRESS comes over to the table.
       She has the check, and a pot of coffee.

                              WAITRESS
                 Can I get anybody more
                 coffee.

                              JOE
                 No, we're gonna be hittin it.
                 I'll take care of the check.

       She hands the bill to him.

                              WAITRESS
                 Here ya go.  Please pay at the
                 register, if you wouldn't mind.

                              JOE
                 Sure thing.

                              WAITRESS
                 You guys have a wonderful day.

       They all mutter equivalents.  She exits and Joe stands up.

                              JOE
                 I'll take care of this, you guys
                 leave the tip.
                         (to Mr. White)
                 And when I come back, I want my
                 book back.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Sorry, it's my book now.

                              JOE
                 Blonde, shoot this piece of shit,
                 will ya?

       Mr. Blonde shoots Mr. White with his finger.  Mr White
       acts shot.  Joe exits.

                              NICE GUY EDDIE
                Okay, everybody cough up green for
                the little lady.

       Everybody whips out a buck, and throws it on the table.
       Everybody, that is, except Mr. White.

                              NICE GUY EDDIE
                 C'mon, throw in a buck.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Uh-uh.  I don't tip.

                              NICE GUY EDDIE
                 Whaddaya mean you don't tip?

                              MR. WHITE
                 I don't believe in it.

                              NICE GUY EDDIE
                 You don't believe in tipping?

                              MR. PINK
                         (laughing)
                 I love this kid, he's a madman,
                 this guy.

                              MR. BLONDE
                 Do you have any idea what these
                 ladies make?  They make shit.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Don't give me that.  She don't
                 make enough money, she can quit.

       Everybody laughs.

                              NICE GUY EDDIE
                 I don't even know a Jew who'd have
                 the balls to say that.  So let's
                 get this straight. You never ever
                 tip?

                              MR. WHITE
                 I don't tip because society says I
                 gotta.  I tip when somebody
                 deserves a tip.  When somebody
                 really puts forth an effort, they
                 deserve a little something extra.
                 But this tipping automatically,
                 that shit's for the birds.  As far
                 as I'm concerned, they're just
                 doin their job.

                              MR. BLUE
                 Our girl was nice.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Our girl was okay.  She didn't do
                 anything special.

                              MR. BLONDE
                 What's something special, take ya
                 in the kitchen and suck your dick?

       They all laugh.

                              NICE GUY EDDIE
                 I'd go over twelve percent for
                 that.

                              MR. WRITE
                 Look, I ordered coffee.  Now we've
                 been here a long fuckin time, and
                 she's only filled my cup three
                 times.  When I order coffee,  I
                 want it filled six times.

                              MR. BLONDE
                 What if she's too busy?

                              MR. WHITE
                 The words "too busy" shouldn't be
                 in a waitress's vocabulary.

                              NICE GUY EDDIE
                 Excuse me, Mr. White, but the last
                 thing you need is another cup of
                 coffee.

       They all laugh.

                              MR. WHITE
                 These ladies aren't starvin to
                 death.  They make minimum wage.
                 When I worked for minimum wage, I
                 wasn't lucky enough to have a job
                 that society deemed tipworthy.

                              NICE GUY EDDIE
                 Ahh, now we're getting down to it.
                 It's not just that he's a cheap
                 bastard--

                              MR. ORANGE
                 --It is that too--

                              NICE GUY EDDIE
                 --It is that too.  But it's also
                 he couldn't get a waiter job.  You
                 talk like a pissed off dishwasher:
                 "Fuck those cunts and their
                 fucking tips."

                              MR. BLONDE
                 So you don't care that they're
                 counting on your tip to live?

       Mr. White rubs two of his fingers together.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Do you know what this is?  It's
                 the world's smallest violin,
                 playing just for the waitresses.

                              MR. BLONDE
                 You don't have any idea what
                 you're talking about.  These
                 people bust their ass. This
                 is a hard job.

                              MR. WHITE
                 So's working at McDonald's, but
                 you don't feel the need to tip
                 them.  They're servin ya food, you
                 should tip em.  But no, society
                 says tip these guys over here, but
                 not those guys over there.  That's
                 bullshit.

                              MR. ORANGE
                 They work harder than the kids at
                 McDonald's.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Oh yeah, I don't see them cleaning
                 fryers.

                              MR. BROWN
                 These people are taxed on the tips
                 they make.  When you stiff 'em,
                 you cost them money.

                              MR. BLONDE
                 Waitressing is the number one
                 occupation for female non-college
                 graduates in this country.  It's
                 the one jab basically any woman
                 can get, and make a living on.
                 The reason is because of tips.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Fuck all that.

       They all laugh.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Hey, I'm very sorry that the
                 government taxes their tips.
                 That's fucked up.  But that ain't
                 my fault.  it would appear that
                 waitresses are just one of the
                 many groups the government fucks
                 in the ass on a regular basis.
                 You show me a paper says the
                 government shouldn't do that, I'll
                 sign it.  Put it to a vote, I'll
                 vote for it.  But what I won't do
                 is play ball.  And this non-
                 college bullshit you're telling
                 me, I got two words for that:
                 "Learn to fuckin type."  Cause if
                 you're expecting me to help out
                 with the rent, you're in for a big
                 fuckin surprise.

                              MR. ORANGE
                 He's convinced me.  Give me my
                 dollar back.

       Everybody laughs.  Joe's comes back to the table.

                              JOE
                 Okay ramblers, let's get to
                 rambling.  Wait a minute, who
                 didn't throw in?

                              MR. ORANGE
                 Mr. White.

                              JOE
                         (to Mr. Orange)
                 Mr. White?
                         (to Mr. White)
                 Why?

                              MR. ORANGE
                 He don't tip.

                              JOE
                         (to Mr. Orange)
                 He don't tip?
                         (to Mr. White)
                 You don't tip?  Why?

                              MR. ORANGE
                 He don't believe in it.

                              JOE
                         (to Mr. Orange)
                 He don't believe in it?
                         (to Mr. White)
                 You don't believe in it?

                              MR. ORANGE
                 Nope.

                              JOE
                         (to Mr. Orange)
                 Shut up!
                         (to Mr. White)
                 Cough up the buck, ya cheap
                 bastard, I paid for your goddamn
                 breakfast.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Because you paid for the
                 breakfast, I'm gonna tip.
                 Normally I wouldn't.

                              JOE
                 Whatever.  Just throw in your
                 dollar, and let's move.
                         (to Mr. Blonde)
                 See what I'm dealing with here.
                 Infants.  I'm fuckin dealin with
                 infants.

       The eight men get up to leave.  Mr. White's waist is in
       the F.G.  As he buttons his coat, for a second we see he's
       carrying a gun.  They exit Uncle Bob's Pancake House,
       talking amongst themselves.


2      EXT. UNCLE BOB'S PANCAKE HOUSE - DAY

       CREDIT SEQUENCE:

       When the credit sequence is finished, we    FADE TO BLACK:

       Over the BLACK we hear the sound of SOMEONE SCREAMING in
       agony.

       Under the screaming, we hear the sound of a car HAULING
       ASS, through traffic.

       Over the screams and the traffic noise, we hear SOMEBODY
       ELSE SAY:

                              SOMEBODY ELSE (OS)
                 Just hold on buddy boy.

       Somebody stops screaming long enough to say:

                            SOMEBODY (OS)
                 I'm sorry.  I can't believe
                 she killed me.  Who would've
                 fuckin thought that?

                                                        CUT TO:

3      INT. GETAWAY GAR (MOVING) - DAY

       The Somebody screaming is Mr. Orange.  He lies in the
       backseat.  He's been SHOT in the stomach.  BLOOD covers
       both him and the backseat.

       Mr. White is the Somebody Else.  He's behind the wheel of
       the getaway car.  He's easily doing 80 mph, dodging in and
       out of traffic.  Though he's driving for his life, he
       keeps talking to his wounded passenger in the backseat.

       They are the only two in the car.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Hey, just cancel that shit right
                 now!  You're hurt.  You're hurt
                 really fucking bad, but you ain't
                 dying.

                              MR. ORANGE
                         (crying)
                 All this blood is scaring the shit
                 outta me.  I'm gonna die, I know
                 it.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you
                 had a degree in medicine.  Are you
                 a doctor?  Are you a doctor?
                 Answer me please, are you a
                 doctor?

                              MR. ORANGE
                 No, I'm not!

                              MR. WRITE
                 Ahhhh, so you admit you don't know
                 what you're talking about.  So if
                 you're through giving me your
                 amateur opinion, lie back and
                 listen to the news.  I'm taking
                 you back to the rendezvous, Joe's
                 gonna get you a doctor, the
                 doctor's gonna fix you up, and
                 you're gonna be okay.  Now say it:
                 you're gonna be okay.  Say it:
                 you're gonna be okay!

       Mr. Orange doesn't respond.  Mr. White starts pounding on
       the steering wheel.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Say-the-goddamn-words: you're
                 gonna be okay!

                              MR. ORANGE
                 I'm okay.

                              MR. WHITE
                         (softly)
                 Correct.

4      INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

       The CAMERA does a 360 around an empty warehouse.  Then the
       door swings open, and Mr. White carries the bloody body of
       Mr. Orange inside.

       Mr. Orange still is MOANING loudly from his bullet hit.

       Mr. White lays him down upon a mattress on the floor.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Just hold on buddy boy.  Hold on,
                 and wait for Joe.  I can't do
                 anything for you, but when Joe
                 gets here, which should be anytime
                 now, he'll be able to help you.
                 We're just gonna sit here, and
                 wait for Joe.  Who are
                 we waiting for?

                              MR. ORANGE
                 Joe.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Bet your sweet ass we are.

       Mr. White gets up from over Mr. Orange and starts to prowl
       around the warehouse.

                              MR. ORANGE
                         (yelling)
                 Don't leave me!

       Mr White bends back over him and takes his hand.

                              MR. WHITE
                 I ain't going anywhere.  I'm right
                 here.  I'm not gonna leave ya.

                              MR. ORANGE
                 Larry, I'm so scared, would you
                 please hold me.

       Mr. White very gently embraces the bloody Mr. Orange.
       Cradling the young man, Mr. White whispers to him.

                              MR. WHITE
                         (whispering)
                 Go ahead and be scared, you've
                 been brave enough for one day.  I
                 want you to just relax now.
                 You're not gonna die, you're gonna
                 be fine.  When Joe gets here,
                 he'll make ya a hundred percent
                 again.

       Mr. White lays Mr. Orange back down on the mattress.  He's
       still holding his hand.  Mr. Orange looks up at his
       friend.

                              MR. ORANGE
                 Look, I don't wanna be a fly in
                 the ointment, but if help doesn't
                 come soon, I gotta see a doctor.
                 I don't give a fuck about jail, I
                 just don't wanna die.

                              MR. WHITE
                 You're not gonna fucking die, all
                 right?

                              MR. ORANGE
                 I wasn't born yesterday.  I'm
                 hurt, and I'm hurt bad.

                              MR. WHITE
                 It's not good...

                              MR. ORANGE
                 Hey, bless your heart for what
                 you're trying to do.  I was
                 panicking for a moment, but I've
                 got my senses back now.  The
                 situation is, I'm shot in the
                 belly.  And without medical
                 attention, I'm gonna die.

                              MR. WHITE
                 I can' take you to a hospital.

                              MR. ORANGE
                 Fuck jail!  I don't give a shit
                 about jail.  But I can't die.  You
                 don't have to take me in.  Just
                 drive me up to the front, drop me
                 on the sidewalk.  I'll take care
                 of myself.  I won't tell them
                 anything.  I swear to fucking god,
                 I won't tell 'em anything.  Look
                 in my eyes, look right in my eyes.
                         (Mr. White does)
                 I-won't-tell-them-anything.
                 You'll be safe.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Lie back down, and try to--

                              MR. ORANGE
                 I'm going to die!   I need a
                 doctor!  I'm begging you,
                 take me to a doctor.
       
       Mr. Orange lays his head back on the mattress.  Spent from
       his outburst, he quietly mutters to himself:

                              MR. ORANGE
                 Take me to a doctor, take me to a
                 doctor, please.

       Suddenly, the warehouse door BURSTS open and Mr.
       Pink steps inside.

                              MR. PINK
                 Was that a fucking set-up or what?

       Mr. Pink sees Mr. Orange on the floor, shot and bloody.

                              MR. PINK
                 Oh fuck, Orange got tagged.

       Throughout this scene, we hear Mr. Orange moaning.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Gun shot.

                              MR. PINK
                 Oh that's just fucking great!
                 Where's Brown?

                              MR. WHITE
                 Dead.

                              MR. PINK
                 Goddamn, goddamn!  How did he die?

                              MR. WHITE
                 How the fuck do you think?  The
                 cops shot him.

                              MR. PINK
                 Oh this is bad, this is so bad.
                         (referring to Mr.
                          Orange)
                 Is it bad?

                              MR. WHITE
                 As opposed to good?

                              MR. PINK
                 This is so fucked up.  Somebody
                 fucked us big time.

                              MR. WHITE
                 You really think we were set up?

                              MR. PINK
                 You even doubt it?  I don't think
                 we got set up, I know we got set
                 up!  I mean really, seriously,
                 where did all those cops come
                 from, huh?  One minute they're not
                 there, the next minute
                 they're there.  I didn't hear any
                 sirens.  The alarm went off, okay.
                 Okay, when an alarm goes off, you
                 got an average of four minutes
                 response time.  Unless a patrol
                 car is cruising that street, at
                 that particular moment, you got
                 four minutes before they can
                 realistically respond.  In one
                 minute there were seventeen blue
                 boys out there.  All loaded for
                 bear, all knowing exactly what the
                 fuck they were doing, and they
                 were all just there!  Remember
                 that second wave that showed up in
                 the cars? Those were the ones
                 responding to the alarm.  but
                 those other motherfuckers were
                 already there, they were waiting
                 for us.
                         (pause)
                 You haven't thought about this?

                              MR. WHITE
                 I haven't had a chance to think.
                 First I was just trying to get the
                 fuck outta there.  And after we
                 got away, I've just been dealin
                 with him.

                              MR. PINK
                 Well, you better start thinking
                 about it.  Cause I, sure as fuck,
                 am thinking about it.  In fact,
                 that's all I'm thinking about.  I
                 came this close to just driving
                 off.  Whoever set us up, knows
                 about this place.  There could've
                 been cops sitting here waiting for
                 me.  For all we know, there's
                 cops, driving fast, on their way
                 here now.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Let's go in the other room...

       The camera creeps along a wall, coming to a corner.  We
       move past it, and see down a hall.

5      INT. BATHROOM HALLWAY - DAY

       At the end of the hall is a bathroom.  The bathroom door
       is partially closed, restricting our view.  Mr. Pink is
       obscured, but Mr. White is in view.

                              MR. PINK (OS)
                 What the fuck am I doing here?  I
                 felt funny about this job right
                 off.  As soon as I felt it I
                 should said "No thank you", and
                 walked.  But I never fucking
                 listen.  Every time I ever got
                 burned buying weed, I always knew
                 the guy wasn't right.  I just felt
                 it.  But I wanted to believe him.
                 If he's not lyin to me, and it
                 really is Thai stick, then whoa
                 baby.  But it's never Thai stick.
                 and I always said if I felt that
                 way about a job, I'd walk.  And I
                 did, and I didn't, because of
                 fuckin money!

                              MR. WHITE
                 What's done is done, I need you
                 cool.  Are you cool?

                              MR. PINK
                 I'm cool.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Splash some water on your face.
                 Take a breather.

       We hear the sink running, and Mr. Pink splashing water on
       his face.

                              MR. WHITE
                 I'm gonna get me my smokes.

       Mr White opens the bathroom door, walks down the hall, and
       OUT OF FRAME.  We see Mr. Pink, his back turned towards
       us, bent over the sink.  Then he grabs a towels, and dries
       his face.  Mr White ENTERS FRAME with a pack of
       Chesterfields in his hand.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Want a smoke?

                              MR. PINK
                 Why not?

       The two men light up.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Okay, let's go through what
                 happened.  We're in the place,
                 everything's going fine.  Then the
                 alarm gets tripped.  I turn around
                 and all these cops are outside.
                 You're right, it was like, bam!  I
                 blink my eyes are they're there.
                 Everybody starts going apeshit.
                 Then Mr. Blonde starts shootin all
                 the--

                              MR. PINK
                 --That's not correct.

                              MR. WHITE
                 What's wrong with it?

                              MR. PINK
                 The cops didn't show up after the
                 alarm went off.  They didn't show
                 till after Mr. Blonde started
                 shooting everyone.

                              MR. WHITE
                 As soon as I heard the alarm, I
                 saw the cops.

                              MR. PINK
                 I'm telling ya, it wasn't that
                 soon.  They didn't let their
                 presence be known until after Mr.
                 Blonde went off.  I'm not sayin
                 they weren't there, I'm sayin they
                 were there.  But they didn't move
                 in till Mr. Blonde became a
                 madman.  That's how I know we were
                 set up.  You can see that,
                 can't you, Mr. White?

                              MR. WHITE
                 Look, enough of this "Mr White"
                 shit--

                              MR. PINK
                 --Don't tell me your name, I don't
                 want to know!  I sure as hell
                 ain't gonna tell ya
                 mine.

                              MR. WHITE
                 You're right, this is bad.
                         (pause)
                 How did you get out?

                              MR. PINK
                 Shot my way out.  Everybody was
                 shooting, so I just blasted my way
                 outta there.

                                                        CUT TO:


6      EXT. CROWDED CITY STREET - DAY

       Mr. Pink is hauling ass down a busy city sidewalk.  He has
       a canvas bag with a shoulder strap in one hand, and a .357
       MAGNUM in the other.  If any BYSTANDERS get in his way, he
       just knocks them down.  We DOLLY at the same speed, right
       along side of him.

       FOUR POLICEMEN are running after Mr. Pink.  We DOLLY with
       them.

       We DOLLY with a young woman on roller skates.  ROLLERGIRL
       is plugged into a walkman.  We hear the song she's
       listening to LOUD over the SOUNDTRACK.  She's twirling and
       skating backwards to the beat of the song.

       Rollergirl turns a corner and COLLIDES with Mr. Pink.  The
       man and woman CRASH to the ground.

       Mr. Pink rolls into the street, in front of a moving car
       that SCREECHES to a stop, narrowly avoiding running over
       him.


7      INT. CAR (STOPPED) - DAY

       The CAMERA is in the backseat. A SHOCKED WOMAN is the
       car's driver.  Mr. Pink pulls himself up from the hood,
       shakes it off, and points his magnum at the driver.

                              MR. PINK
                 Get outta the car!  Get the fuck
                 outta the car!

       The Shocked Woman starts screaming.

       Mr. Pink tries to open the driver's side door, but it's
       locked.

                              MR. PINK
                 Open the fucking door!

       EXTREME C.U. DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW

       Mr. Pink SMASHES it in our face.


8      EXT. STREET - DAY

       DOLLY with Cops coming up fast.

       Mr. Pink DRAGS the Shocked Woman out of the car.

       The Cops reach the corner, guns aimed.

       Using the car as a shield, Mr. Pink FIRES three shots at
       the Cops.

       Everybody HITS the ground, or scatters.

       Mr. Pink HOPS in the car.

       Cops FIRE.


9      INT. CAR (MOVING) - DAY

       CAMERA in the backseat, Mr. Pink FLOORS it.  SPEEDING down
       the street, with the Cops FIRING after him.

                                                        BACK TO:


10     INT. BATHROOM - DAY

       Mr. Pink and Mr. White still talking in the bathroom.

                              MR. PINK
                 Tagged a couple of cops.  Did you
                 kill anybody?

                              MR. WHITE
                 A few cops.

                              MR. PINK
                 No real people?

                              MR. WHITE
                 Uh-uh, just cops.

                              MR. PINK
                 Could you believe Mr. Blonde?

                              MR. WHITE
                 That was one of the most insane
                 fucking things I've ever seen.
                 Why the fuck would Joe hire
                 somebody like that?

                              MR. PINK
                 I don't wanna kill anybody.  But
                 if I gotta get out that door, and
                 you're standing in my way, one way
                 of the other, you're gettin outta
                 my way.

                              MR. WHITE
                 That's the way I look at it.  A
                 choice between doin ten years, and
                 takin out some stupid
                 motherfucker, ain't no choice at
                 all.  But I ain't no madman
                 either.  What the fuck was Joe
                 thinkin?  You can't work with a
                 guy like that.  That mother-
                 fucker's unstable.  What do you
                 think?  Do you think he panicked,
                 or ya think he's just trigger-
                 happy?

                              MR. PINK
                 I think he's a sick fuckin maniac!
                 We're awful goddamn lucky he
                 didn't tag us, when
                 he shot up the place.  I came this
                 fucking close--
                         (hold up two fingers
                          and makes a tiny
                          space between them)
                 --to taking his ass out myself.
                 Everybody panics.  When things get
                 tense, everybody panics.
                 Everybody.  I don't care what your
                 name is, you can't help it.  It's
                 human nature.  But ya panic on the
                 inside.
                 Ya panic in your head.  Ya give
                 yourself a couple a seconds of
                 panic, then you get a grip and
                 deal with the situation.  What you
                 don't do, is shoot up the place
                 and kill everybody.

                              MR. WHITE
                 What you're supposed to do is act
                 like a fuckin professional.  A
                 psychopath is not a professional.
                 You can't work with a psychopath,
                 'cause ya don't know what those
                 sick assholes are gonna do next.
                 I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do
                 you think that black girl was?
                 Twenty, maybe twenty-one?

                              MR. PINK
                 Did ya see what happened to
                 anybody else?

                              MR. WHITE
                 Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the
                 car and Mr. Brown floored it.
                 After that, I don't know what went
                 down.

                              MR. PINK
                 At that point it became every man
                 for himself.  As far as Mr. Blonde
                 or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't
                 got the foggiest.  Once
                 I got out, I never looked back.

                              MR. WHITE
                 What do you think?

                              MR. PINK
                 What do I think?  I think the cops
                 caught them, or killed 'em.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Not even a chance they punched
                 through?  You found a hole.

                              MR. PINK
                 Yeah, and that was a fucking
                 miracle.  But if they did get
                 away, where the fuck are they?

                              MR. WHITE
                 You don't think it's possible, one
                 of them got ahold of the diamonds
                 and pulled a--

                              MR. PINK
                 Nope.

                              MR. WHITE
                 How can you be so sure?

                              MR. PINK
                 I got the diamonds.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Where?

                              MR. PINK
                 I got 'em, all right?

                              MR. WHITE
                 Where?  Are they out in the car?

                              MR. PINK
                 No, they're not in the car.  No, I
                 don't have them on me.  Ya wanna
                 go with me and get 'em?  Yes, we
                 can go right now.  But first
                 listen to what I'm telling you.
                 We were fuckin set up!  Somebody
                 is in league with the cops.  We
                 got a Judas in our midst.  And I'm
                 thinkin we should have our fuckin
                 heads examined for waiting around
                 here.

                              MR. WHITE
                 That was the plan, we meet here.

                              MR. PINK
                 Then where is everybody?  I say
                 the plan became null and void once
                 we found out we got a rat in the
                 house.  We ain't got the slightest
                 fuckin idea what happened to Mr.
                 Blonde or Mr. Blue.  They could
                 both be dead
                 or arrested.  They could be
                 sweatin 'em, down at the station
                 house right now.  Yeah they don't
                 know the names, but they can sing
                 about this place.
                 I mean, that could be happening
                 right now.  As we speak, the cops
                 could be in their cars, drivin
                 here this minute.

                              MR. WHITE
                 I swear to god I'm fuckin jinxed.

                              MR. PINK
                 What?

                              MR. WHITE
                 Two jobs back, it was a four man
                 job, we discovered one of the team
                 was an undercover cop.

                              MR. PINK
                 No shit?

                              MR. WHITE
                 Thank god, we discovered in time.
                 We hadda forget the whole fuckin
                 thing.  Just walked away from it.

                              MR. PINK
                 So who's the rat this time?  Mr.
                 Blue?  Mr. Blonde?  Joe?  It's
                 Joe's show, he set this whole
                 thing up.  Maybe he set it up to
                 set it up.

                              MR. WHITE
                 I don't buy it.  Me and Joe go
                 back a long time.  I can tell ya
                 straight up, Joe definitely didn't
                 have anything to do with this
                 bullshit.

                              MR. PINK
                 Oh, you and Joe go back a long
                 time.  I known Joe since I was a
                 kid.  But me saying Joe definitely
                 couldn't have done it is
                 ridiculous.  I can say I
                 definitely didn't do it, cause I
                 know what I did or didn't do.  But
                 I can't definitely say that about
                 anybody else, 'cause I don't
                 definitely know.  For all I know,
                 you're the rat.

                              MR. WHITE
                 For all I know, you're the rat.

                              MR. PINK
                 Now you're using your head. For
                 all we know, he's the rat.

       Mr. Pink points OFFSCREEN to Mr. Orange.  Mr. White's
       expression changes.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Jesus Christ!


11     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

       They run over to Mr. Orange, who's unconscious.  The
       CAMERA hovers over the action.  Mr. Pink reaches him
       first.

                              MR. PINK
                 Is he dead?

       Mr. White pushes him out of the way.  He feels the pulse
       on Mr. Orange's neck.

                              MR. PINK
                 So, is he dead or what?

                              MR. WHITE
                 He ain't dead.

                              MR. PINK
                 So what is it?

                              MR. WHITE
                 I think he's just passed out.

                              MR. PINK
                 He scared the fuckin shit outta
                 me.  I thought he was dead fer
                 sure.

       Mr. White stands up and walks over to a table.

                              MR. WHITE
                 He will be dead fer sure, if we
                 don't get him to a hospital.

                              MR. PINK
                 We can't take him to a hospital.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Without medical attention, this
                 man won't live through the night.
                 That bullet in his belly is my
                 fault.  Now while that might not
                 mean jack shit to you, it means a
                 helluva lot to me.  And I'm not
                 gonna just sit around and watch
                 him die.

                              MR. PINK
                 Well, first things first, staying
                 here's goofy.  We gotta book up.

                              MR. WHITE
                 So what do you suggest, we go to a
                 hotel?  We got a guy who's shot in
                 the belly, he can't walk, he
                 bleeds like a stuck pig, and when
                 he's awake, he screams in pain.

                              MR. PINK
                 You gotta idea, spit it out.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Joe could help him.  If we can get
                 in touch with Joe, Joe could get
                 him to a doctor, Joe could get a
                 doctor to come and see him.

       During Mr. Pink's dialog, we slowly ZOOM in to a 
       C.U. of Mr. White.

                              MR. PINK (OS)
                 Assuming we can trust Joe, how we
                 gonna get in touch with him?  He's
                 supposed to be here, but he ain't,
                 which is making me nervous about
                 being here.  Even if Joe is
                 on the up and up, he's probably
                 not gonna be that happy with us.
                 Joe planned a robbery, but he's
                 got a blood bath on his hands now.
                 Dead cops, dead robbers, dead
                 civilians...Jesus Christ!  I tend
                 to doubt he's gonna have a lot of
                 sympathy for our plight.  If I was
                 him, I'd try and put as much
                 distance between me and this mess
                 an humanly possible.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Before you got here, Mr. Orange
                 was askin me to take him to a
                 hospital.  Now I don't like
                 turning him over to the cops, but
                 if we don't, he's dead.  He begged
                 me to do it.  I told him to hold
                 off till Joe got here.

                              MR. PINK (OS)
                 Well Joe ain't gettin here.  We're
                 on our own.  Now, I don't know a
                 goddamn body who can help him, so
                 if you know somebody, call 'em.

                              MR. WHITE
                 I don't know anybody.

                              MR. PINK (OS)
                 Well, I guess we drop him off at
                 the hospital.  Since he don't know
                 nothin about us, I say it's his
                 decision.


       MR. WHITE'S POV:

       C.U. OF MR. PINK.

                              MR. WHITE (OS)
                 Well, he knows a little about me.

                              MR. PINK
                 You didn't tell him your name, did
                 ya?

                              MR. WHITE (OS)
                 I told him my first name, and
                 where I'm from.

       There is a long silence and a blank look from Mr. Pink,
       then he SCREAMS:

                              MR. PINK
                 Why!

                              MR. WHITE (OS)
                 I told him where I was from a few
                 days ago.  It was just a casual
                 conversation.

                              MR. PINK
                 And what was tellin him your name
                 when you weren't supposed to?

                              MR. WHITE (OS)
                 He asked.

       Mr. Pink looks at Mr. White like he's retarded.

                              MR. WHITE (OS)
                 We had just gotten away from the
                 cops.  He just got shot.  It was
                 my fuckin fault he got shot.  He's
                 a fuckin bloody mess - he's
                 screaming.  I swear to god, I
                 thought we was gonna die right
                 then and there.  I'm tryin to
                 comfort him, telling him not to
                 worry, he's gonna be okay, I'm
                 gonna take care of him.  And he
                 asked me what my name was.  I
                 mean, the man was dyin in my arms.
                 What the fuck was I supposed to
                 tell him, "Sorry, I can't give out
                 that information, it's against the
                 rules.  I don't trust you
                 enough."?  Maybe I shoulda, but I
                 couldn't.

                              MR. PINK
                 Oh, I don't doubt is was quite
                 beautiful--

                              MR. WHITE (OS)
                 Don't fuckin patronize me.

                              MR. PINK
                 One question: Do they have a sheet
                 on you, where you told him you're
                 from?

                              MR. WHITE (OS)
                 Of course.

                              MR. PINK
                 Well that's that, then.  I mean, I
                 was worried about mug shot
                 possibilities already.  But now he
                 knows: (a) what you look like, (b)
                 what your first name is,
                 (i) where you're from and (d) what
                 your specialty is.
                 They ain't gonna hafta show him a
                 helluva lot of pictures for him to
                 pick you out.  That's it right,
                 you didn't tell him anything else
                 that could narrow down the
                 selection?

                              MR. WHITE (OS)
                 If I have to tell you again to
                 back off, me an you are gonna go
                 round and round.

       Mr. Pink walks out of the C.U. and turns his back on Mr.
       White.  Mr. White's POV PANS over to him.

                              MR. PINK
                 We ain't taking him to a hospital.

                              MR. WHITE (OS)
                 If we don't, he'll die.

                              MR. PINK
                 And I'm very sad about that.  But
                 some fellas are lucky, and some
                 ain't.

                              MR. WHITE (OS)
                 That fuckin did it!

       Mr. White's POV CHARGES toward Mr. Pink.

       Mr. Pink turns toward him in time to get PUNCHED hard in
       the mouth.

       END OF POV

       Mr. White and Mr. Pink have a very ungraceful and
       realistic fight.  They go at each other like a couple of
       alley cats.

       As Mr. White SWINGS and PUNCHES, he SCREAMS:

                               MR. WHITE

                 You little motherfucker!

       Mr. Pink YELLS as he HITS:

                              MR. PINK
                 Ya wanna fuck with me?!  You wanna
                 fuck with me?!  I'll show you who
                 you're fuckin with!

       The two men end up on the floor KICKING and SCRATCHING.

       Mr. White gets Mr. Pink in a HEADLOCK.

       Mr. Pink reaches in his jacket for his gun, and pulls it
       out.

       Mr. White sees this, immediately lets go of Mr. Pink,
       and goes for his own weapon.

       The two men are on the floor, on their knees, with their
       guns outstretched, aiming at one another.

                              MR. WHITE
                 You wanna shoot me, you little
                 piece of shit?  Take a shot!

                              MR. PINK
                 Fuck you, White!  I didn't create
                 this situation,  I'm just dealin
                 with it.  You're acting like a
                 first-year fuckin thief.  I'm
                 actin like a professional.  They
                 get him, they can get you, they
                 get you, they get closer to me,
                 and that can't happen.  And you,
                 you motherfucker, are looking at
                 me like it's my fault.  I didn't
                 tell him my name.  I didn't tell
                 him where I was from.  I didn't
                 tell him what I knew better than
                 to tell him.  Fuck, fifteen
                 minutes ago, you almost told me
                 your name.  You, buddy, are stuck
                 in a situation you created.  So if
                 you wanna throw bad looks
                 somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror.

       Mr. Pink lowers his gun and walks towards White.

                              MR. PINK
                 So if you wanna shoot somebody,
                 put that gun in your mouth and
                 shoot yourself.

       Then from OFF SCREEN we hear:

                              VOICE (OS)
                 You kids don't play so rough.
                 Somebody's gonna start crying.


12     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - MEDIUM C.U. ON MR. BLONDE

       The Voice belongs to the infamous Mr. Blonde.

       Mr. Blonde sits on a counter, drinking a fast food coke
       and eating a hot dog.

                              MR. PINK
                 Mr. Blonde!  You okay?  We thought
                 you might've gotten caught.  What
                 happened?

       Mr. Blonde doesn't answer, he just hops off the counter
       and starts walking around the warehouse, checking the
       place out.

       He doesn't look at either Mr. Pink or Mr. White, he
       just eats his hot dog and sips his coke.

       This is making Pink and White nervous as hell.  But Mr.
       Pink tries to talk through it.

       We HANDHOLD follow Mr. Blonde around the warehouse.

                              MR. PINK
                 Really, how did you get away?

       Mr. Blonde walks the loft.  Silent.

                              MR. PINK
                 You saw what happened to me,
                 I found a hole and booked.

       Silence.

                              MR. PINK
                 Where's Mr. Blue?

       Blonde looks in the bathroom.

                              MR. PINK
                 We were hopin you two would be
                 together.

       Blonde looks out the window.

                              MR. PINK
                 That was the big question we had,
                 what happened to Mr.
                 Blue and you?

       Blonde walks away from the window.

                              MR. PINK
                 We were worried the cops got ya.

       Blonde bends down over Mr. Orange.

                              MR. PINK
                 He got it in the belly.  He's
                 still alive, but won't be for
                 long.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Enough!  You better start talkin
                 to us, asshole, cause we got shit
                 we need to talk about.  We're
                 already freaked out, we need you
                 actin freaky like we need a fuckin
                 bag on our hip.

       Mr. Blonde looks at his two partners in crime, then moves
       towards them.

                              MR. BLONDE
                 So, talk.

                              MR. WHITE
                 We think we got a rat in the
                 house.

                              MR. PINK
                 I guarantee we got a rat in the
                 house.

                              MR. BLONDE
                 What would ever make you think
                 that?

                              MR. WHITE
                 Is that supposed to be funny?

                              MR. PINK
                 We don't think this place is safe.

                              MR. WHITE
                 This place just ain't secure
                 anymore.  We're leaving, and you
                 should go with us.

                              MR. BLONDE
                 Nobody's going anywhere.

       Silence takes over the room.  Mr. Blonde stops moving.

       After a few beats the silence is broken.

                              MR. WHITE
                         (to Mr. Pink)
                 Piss on this turd, we're outta
                 here.

       Mr. White turns to leave.

                              MR. BLONDE
                 Don't take another step, Mr.
                 White.

       Mr. White explodes, raising his gun and charging towards
       Mr. Blonde.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Fuck you, maniac!  It's your
                 fuckin fault we're in so much
                 trouble.

       Mr. Blonde calmly sits down.  He looks to Mr. Pink.

                              MR. BLONDE
                         (referring to Mr.
                          White)
                 What's this guy's problem?

                              MR. WHITE
                 What's my problem?  Yeah, I gotta
                 problem.  I gotta big problem with
                 any trigger-happy madman who
                 almost gets me shot!

                              MR. BLONDE
                 What're you talkin about?

                              MR. WHITE
                 That fuckin shooting spree in the
                 store.

                              MR. BLONDE
                 Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm,
                 they deserve what they got.

                              MR. WHITE
                 You almost killed me, asshole!  If
                 I had any idea what type of guy
                 you were, I never would've agreed
                 to work with you.

                              MR. BLONDE
                 You gonna back all day, little
                 doggie, or are you gonna bite?

                              MR. WHITE
                 What was that?  I'm sorry, I
                 didn't catch it.  Would you repeat
                 it?

                              MR. BLONDE
                         (slowly)
                 I said: "Are you gonna bark all
                 day, dog, or are you gonna bite."

                              MR. PINK
                 Both of you two assholes knock it
                 the fuck off and calm down!

                              MR. WHITE
                         (to Mr. Blonde)
                 So you wanna git bit, huh?

                              MR. PINK
                 Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a
                 fuckin playground!
                         (pause)
                 I don't believe this shit, both of
                 you got ten years on me, and I'm
                 the only one actin like a
                 professional.  You guys act like a
                 bunch of fuckin niggers.  You ever
                 work a job with a bunch of
                 niggers?  They're just like you
                 two, always fightin, always sayin
                 they're gonna kill one another.

                              MR. WHITE
                         (to Mr. Pink)
                 You said yourself, you
                 thought about takin him out.

                              MR. PINK
                 Then.  That time has passed.
                 Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only
                 one I completely trust.  He's too
                 fuckin homicidal to be workin with
                 the cops.

                              MR. WHITE
                 You takin his side?

                              MR. PINK
                 Fuck sides!  What we need is a
                 little solidarity here.
                 Somebody's stickin a red hot poker
                 up our asses and we gotta find out
                 whose hand's on the handle.  Now I
                 know I'm no piece of shit...
                         (referring to Mr.
                          White)
                 And I'm pretty sure you're a good
                 boy...
                         (referring to Mr.
                          Blonde)
                 And I'm fuckin positive you're on
                 the level.  So let's figure out
                 who's the bad guy.

       Mr. White calms down and puts his gun away.

       Mr. Blonde returns to the persona we saw at the beginning,
       talking about Madonna.

                              MR. BLONDE
                 Well, that was sure exciting.
                         (to Mr. White)
                 You're a big Lee Marvin fan,
                 aren't you?  Me too.  I don't know
                 about the rest of you fellas, but
                 my heart's
                 beatin fast.
                         (pause for a beat)
                 Okay you guys, follow me.

       Mr. Blonde hops out of his chair and heads for the door.

       The other two men just follow him with their eyes.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Follow you where?

                              MR. BLONDE
                 Down to my car.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Why?

                              MR. BLONDE
                 It's a surprise.

       Mr. Blonde walks out.


13     EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

       Three cars are parked out front.  Mr. Blonde is walking
       towards the car he drove.  Mr. White and Mr. Pink are
       walking behind.  The Camera is HANDHELD following behind
       them.

                              MR. PINK
                 We still gotta get out of here.

                              MR. BLONDE
                 We're gonna sit here and wait.

                              MR. WHITE
                 For what, the cops?

                              MR. BLONDE
                 Nice Guy Eddie.

                              MR. PINK
                 Nice Guy Eddie?  What makes you
                 think Nice Guy's anywhere but on a
                 plane half way to Costa Rica?

                              MR. BLONDE
                 Cause I just talked to him.  He's
                 on his way down here, and nobody's
                 going anywhere till be gets here.

                              MR. WHITE
                 You talked to Nice Guy Eddie?  Why
                 the fuck didn't you say that in
                 the first place?

                              MR. BLONDE
                 You didn't ask.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Hardy-fuckin-har.  What did he
                 say?

                              MR. BLONDE
                 Stay put.  Okay, fellas, take a
                 look at the little surprise I
                 brought you.

       Mr. Blonde opens up the truck of his car.  A handcuffed,
       uniformed POLICEMAN is curled up inside the trunk.

                              MR. BLONDE
                 So while we're waitin for Nice Guy
                 Eddie, what say we have a little
                 fun finding out who the rat is.


       INSERT: TITLE CARD "MR. BLONDE".


14     INT. JOE CABOT'S OFFICE - DAY

       We're inside the office of Joe Cabot.  Joe's on the phone,
       sitting behind his desk.

                              JOE
                         (into phone)
                 Sid, I'm tellin you don't worry
                 about it.  You had a bad couple of
                 months, it happens.
                         (pause)
                 Sid, Sid, Sid...Stop, you're
                 embarrassing me.  I don't need to
                 be told what I already know.  When
                 you have bad months, you do what
                 every business man in the
                 worlds does, I don't care if he's
                 Donald Trump or Irving the tailor.
                 Ya ride it out.

       There's a KNOCK on Cabot's office door.

                              JOE
                 Come in.

       One of Cabot's goons, TEDDY, opens the door and steps
       inside.  Cabot covers the receiver with his hand and looks
       towards the man.

                              TEDDY
                 Vic Vega's outside.

                              JOE
                 Tell him to come in.

       Teddy leaves.

                              JOE
                         (into phone)
                 Sid, a friend of mine's here.  I
                 gotta go.
                         (pause)
                 Good enough, bye.

       He hangs up the phone, stands, and walks around to the
       front of the desk.

       Teddy opens the office door, and TOOTHPICK VIC VEGA walks
       in.

       Toothpick Vic Vega is none other than our very own Mr.
       Blonde.  Vic is dressed in a long black leather seventies
       style jacket.

       Joe stands in front of his desk with his arms open.

       The two men embrace each other.  Teddy leaves, closing the
       door behind him.

                              JOE
                 How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin
                 good, ain't it?

                              VIC
                 It's a change.

                              JOE
                 Ain't that a sad truth.  Remy
                 Martin?

                              VIC
                 Sure.

                              JOE
                 Take a seat.

       Joe goes over to his liquor cabinet.  Vic sits in a chair
       set in front of Joe's desk.

                              JOE
                         (while he pours the
                          drink)
                 Who's your parole officer?

                              VIC
                 A guy named Koons.  Craig Koons.

                              JOE
                 How is he?

                              VIC
                 Fuckin asshole, won't let me leave
                 the halfway house.

                              JOE
                 Never ceases to amaze me.  Fuckin
                 jungle bunny goes out there, slits
                 some old woman's throat for
                 twenty-five cents.  Fuckin nigger
                 gets Doris Day as a parole
                 officer.  But a good fella like
                 you gets stuck with a ball-bustin
                 prick.

       Joe walks back around his desk and sits in his chair.

       Vic swallows some Remy.

                              VIC
                 I just want you to know, Joe, how
                 much I appreciate your care
                 packages on the inside.

                              JOE
                 What the hell did you expect me to
                 do?  Just forget about you?

                              VIC
                 I just wanted you to know, they
                 meant a lot.

                              JOE
                 It's the least I could do Vic.  I
                 wish I coulda done more.
                         (Joe flashes a side
                          grin at Vic)
                 Vic. Toothpick Vic.  Tell me a
                 story?  What're your plans?

                              VIC
                 Well, what I wanna do is go back
                 to work.  But I got this Koons
                 prick deep up my ass.  He won't
                 let me leave the halfway house
                 till I get some piece of shit job.
                 My plans have always been to be
                 part of the team again.

       There's a KNOCK at the door.

                              JOE
                 Come in.

       The door opens and in walks Joe's son, Nice Guy Eddie.
       Vic turns around in his seat and sees him.

                              EDDIE
                         (to Vic)
                 I see ya sittin here, but I don't
                 believe it.

       Vic gets out of his seat and hugs Eddie.

                              EDDIE
                 How ya doin, Toothpick?

                              VIC
                 Fine, now.

                              EDDIE
                 I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked
                 you up personally at the pen.
                 This whole week's just been crazy.
                 I've had my head up my ass the
                 entire time.

                              VIC
                 Funny you should mention it.
                 That's what your father and I been
                 talkin about.

                              EDDIE
                 That I should've picked you up?

                              VIC
                 No.  That your head's been up your
                 ass.  I walk through the door and
                 Joe says "Vic, you're back, thank
                 god.  Finally somebody who knows
                 what the fuck he's doing.  Vic,
                 Vic, Vic, Eddie, my son, is a fuck
                 up."  And I say "Well, Joe, I
                 coulda told you that."  "I'm
                 ruined!  He's ruining me!  My son,
                 I love him, but he's taking my
                 business and flushing it down the
                 fuckin toilet!"
                         (to Joe)
                 I'm not tellin tales out of
                 school.  You tell 'im Joe.
                 Tell 'im yourself.

                              JOE
                 Eddie, I hate like hell for you to
                 hear it this way.  But when Vic
                 asked me how's business, well, you
                 don't lie to a man who's just done
                 four years in the slammer for ya.

       Eddie bobs his head up and down.

                              EDDIE
                  Oh really, is that a fact?

       Eddie JUMPS Vic and they fall to the floor.

       The two friends, laughing and cussing at each other,
       wrestle on the floor of Joe's office.

       Joe's on his feet yelling at them.

                              JOE
                         (yelling)
                 Okay, okay, enough, enough!
                 Playtime's over!  You wanna roll
                 around on the floor, do it in
                 Eddie's office, not mine!

       The two men break it up.  They are completely disheveled,
       hair a mess, shirttails out.  As they get themselves
       together, they continue to taunt one another.

                              EDDIE
                 Daddy, did ya see that?

                              JOE
                 What?

                              EDDIE
                 Guy got me on the ground, tried to
                 fuck me.

                              VIC
                 You fuckin wish.

                              EDDIE
                 You tried to fuck me in my
                 father's office, you sick bastard.
                 Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do
                 in the privacy of your own home,
                 go do it.  But don't try to fuck
                 me.  I don't think of you that
                 way.  I mean, I like you a lot--

                              VIC
                 Eddie, if I was a pirate, I
                 wouldn't throw you to the crew.

                              EDDIE
                 No, you'd keep me for yourself.
                 Four years fuckin punks in the ass
                 made you appreciate prime rib when
                 you get it.

                              VIC
                 I might break you, Nice Guy, but
                 I'd make you my dog's bitch.
                 You'd be suckin the dick and going
                 down on a mangy T-bone hound.

                              EDDIE
                 Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy,
                 walks into jail a white man, walks
                 out talkin like a nigger.  It's
                 all that black semen been shootin
                 up his butt.  It's backed up into
                 his brain and comes out of his
                 mouth.

                              JOE
                 Are you two finished?  We were
                 talkin about some serious shit
                 when you came in Eddie.  We got a
                 big problem we're tryin to solve.
                 Now Eddie, would you like to sit
                 down and help us solve it, or do
                 you two wanna piss fart around?

       Playtime is over and Vic and Eddie know it.  So they both
       take seats in front of Joe's desk.

                              JOE
                 Now Vic was tellin me, he's got a
                 parole problem.

                              EDDIE
                 Really?  Who's your P.O.?

                              VIC
                 Craig Koons.

                              EDDIE
                 Koons?  Oh shit, I hear he's a
                 motherfucker.

                              VIC
                 He is a motherfucker.  He won't
                 let me leave the halfway house
                 till I get some piece of shit job.

                              EDDIE
                 You're coming back to work for us,
                 right?

                              VIC
                 I wanna.  But I gotta show this
                 asshole I got an honest-to-
                 goodness job before he'll let me
                 move out on my own.  I can't work
                 for you guys and be worried about
                 gettin back before ten o'clock
                 curfew.

                              JOE
                         (to Eddie)
                 We can work this out, can't we?

                              EDDIE
                 This isn't all that bad.  We can
                 give you a lot of legitimate jobs.
                 Put you on the rotation at Long
                 Beach as a dock worker.

                              VIC
                 I don't wanna lift crates.

                              EDDIE
                 You don't hafta lift shit.  You
                 don't really work there.  But as
                 far as the records are concerned,
                 you do.  I call up Matthews, the
                 foreman, tell him he's got a new
                 guy.  You're on the schedule.  You
                 got a timecard, it's clocked in
                 and out for you everyday, and you
                 get a pay check at the end of the
                 week.  And ya know dock workers
                 don't do too bad.  So you can move
                 into a halfway decent place
                 without Koons thinkin "what the
                 fuck."  And if Koons ever wants to
                 make a surprise visit, you're gone
                 that day.  That day we sent you to
                 Tustin.  We gotta bunch of shit
                 you needed to unload there.
                 You're at the Taft airstrip pickin
                 up a bunch of shit and bringing it
                 back.  Part of your jab is goin
                 different places - and we got
                 places all over the place.

                              JOE
                         (to Vic)
                 Didn't I tell ya not to worry?
                         (to Eddie)
                 Vic was worried.

                              EDDIE
                 Me and you'll drive down to Long
                 Beach tomorrow.  I'll introduce
                 you to Matthews, tell him what's
                 going on.

                              VIC
                 That's great, guy, thanks a bunch.
                         (pause)
                 When do you think you'll need me
                 for real work?

                              JOE
                 Well, it's kinda a strange time
                 right now.  Things are kinda--

                              EDDIE
                 --Nuts.  We got a big meeting in
                 Vegas coming up.  And we're kinda
                 just gettin ready for that right
                 now.

                              JOE
                 Let Nice Guy set you up at Long
                 Beach.  Give ya some cash, get
                 that Koons fuck off your back, and
                 we'll be talking to ya.

                              EDDIE
                 Daddy, I got an idea.  Now just
                 hear it out.  I know you don't
                 like to use any of the boys on
                 these jobs, but technically, Vic
                 ain't one of the boys.  He's been
                 gone for four years.  He ain't on
                 no one's list.  Ya know he can
                 handle himself, ya know you can
                 trust him.

       Joe looks at Vic.

       Vic has no idea what they're talking about.

                              JOE
                 How would you feel about pullin a
                 heist with about five other guys?

                              VIC
                 What's the exposure like?

                              JOE
                 Two minutes, tops.  It's a tough
                 two minutes.  It's a hold up,
                 daylight, during business hours,
                 dealing with a crowd.  But you
                 have the fellas to deal with the
                 crowd.  It's a jewelry store.
                 They're getting a big shipment of
                 South African diamonds on a
                 certain day.  They're like a way
                 station.  It's gonna get picked up
                 the next day and sent to Hamburg.
                 When you walk through the door,
                 you'll know right where to go for
                 the rich stones.
                 The fellas are good, me and Nice
                 Guy picked em.  Nobody knows
                 anybody else.  Nobody's connected.
                 I don't use connected guys for
                 this shit.

                              VIC
                 What's the cut?

                              JOE
                 Juicy, man, real juicy.

       Toothpick Vic smiles.

       So does Nice Guy Eddie.

                                                        CUT TO:


15     INT. NICE GUY EDDIE'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

       Nice Guy Eddie is driving to the rendezvous talking on his
       portable car phone.  The sounds of the seventies are
       coming out of his car radio in the form of "Love Goes
       Where My Rosemary Goes" by Edison Lighthouse.

                              EDDIE
                         (into phone)
                 Hey Dov, we got a major situation
                 here.
                         (pause)
                 I know you know that.  I gotta
                 talk with daddy and find out what
                 he wants done.


       FLASH ON

16     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

       The Cop is standing in the warehouse with his hands cuffed
       behind his back.  Mr. White, Mr. Pink and Mr. Blonde
       surround him and proceed to beat the shit out of him.
       "Love Grows .." PLAYS over the soundtrack.


17     BACK TO NICE GUY EDDIE

                              EDDIE
                         (into phone)
                 All I know is what Vic told me.
                 He said the place turned into a
                 fuckin bullet festival.  He took a
                 cop as hostage, just to get the
                 fuck out of there.


       FLASH ON

18     WAREHOUSE

       The three men are stomping the cop into the ground.


19     BACK TO EDDIE

                              EDDIE
                         (into phone)
                 Do I sound like I'm jokin?  He's
                 fuckin driving around with the cop
                 in his trunk.
                         (pause)
                 I don't know who did that.  I
                 don't know who has the loot, if
                 anybody has the loot.  Who's dead,
                 who's alive, who's caught, who's
                 not...
                 I will know, I'm practically
                 there.  But what do I tell these
                 guys about daddy?
                         (pause)
                 You sure that's what he said?
                         (pause)
                 Okay, that's what I'll tell em.

                                                        CUT TO:


20     EXT.  WAREHOUSE - DAY

       Three cars belonging to the other guys are parked outside
       the warehouse.

       Eddie drives his car up to the warehouse.  He gets out of
       the car, looks at the other cars parked outside.

                              EDDIE
                         (to himself)
                 Fucking assholes.

       Eddie makes a beeline for the front door, BANGS it open,
       and steps inside the warehouse.


21     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

       The robbers have the cop tied to a chair and are still
       WAILING on him.

       Nice Guy Eddie walks in and everybody jumps.

                              EDDIE
                 What in Sam Hill is goin on?

       Mr. Pink and Mr. White speak together.

                    MR. PINK                      MR. WHITE
          Hey, Nice Guy, we got a     You're askin what's goin
          cop.                        on?  Where the fuck is 
                                      Joe?

       Nice Guy sees Mr. Orange.

                              EDDIE
                 Holy shit, this guy's all fucked
                 up!

                              MR. WHITE
                 No shit, he's gonna fuckin die on
                 us if we don't get him taken care
                 of.

                              MR. PINK
                 We were set up, the cops were
                 waiting for us.

                              EDDIE
                 What?  Nobody set anybody up.

                              MR. PINK
                 The cops were there waitin for us!

                              EDDIE
                 Bullshit.

                              MR. PINK
                 Hey, fuck you man, you weren't
                 there, we were.  And I'm tellin
                 ya, the cops had that store staked
                 out.

                              EDDIE
                 Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?

                              MR. PINK
                 What the fuck d'you think we've
                 been askin each other?

                              EDDIE
                 And what are your answers?  Was it
                 me?  You think I set you up?

                              MR. PINK
                 I don't know, but somebody did.

                              EDDIE
                 Nobody did.  You assholes turn the
                 jewelry store into a wild west
                 show, and you wonder why cops show
                 up.

                              MR. BLONDE
                 Where's Joseph?

                              EDDIE
                 I ain't talked to him.  I talked
                 to Dov.  Dov said he's comin out
                 here, and he's fucking pissed.

                              MR. PINK
                         (to Mr. White)
                 I told ya he'd be pissed.

                              MR. WHITE
                         (pointing to Mr.
                          Orange)
                 What are you gonna do about him?

                              EDDIE
                 Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin
                 chance to breathe.  I got a few
                 questions of my own, ya know.

                              MR. WHITE
                 You ain't dying, he is.

                              EDDIE
                 I'll call somebody.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Who?

                              EDDIE
                 A snake charmer, what the fuck
                 d'you think.  I'll call a doctor,
                 take care of him, fix 'm right up.
                 No, where's Mr. Brown and Mr.
                 Blue?

                              MR. PINK
                 Brown's dead, we don't know about
                 Blue.

                              EDDIE
                 Nobody saw what happened to Mr.
                 Blue?

                              MR. BLONDE
                 Well, he's either dead or he's
                 alive or the cops got him or they
                 don't.

       DOLLY to MEDIUM on the cop.

                              EDDIE (OS)
                 I take it this is the bastard you
                 told me about.
                         (referring to the
                          cop)
                 Why the hell are you beating on
                 him?

                              MR. PINK
                 So he'll tell us who the fuck set
                 us up.

                              EDDIE
                 Would you stop it with that shit!
                 You beat on this prick enough,
                 he'll tell ya he started the
                 Chicago fire.  That don't
                 necessarily make it so.  Okay,
                 first things fucking last, where's
                 the shit?  Please tell me somebody
                 brought something
                 with them.

                              MR. PINK
                 I got a bag.  I stashed it till I
                 could be sure this place wasn't a
                 police station.

                              EDDIE
                 Well, let's go get it.  We also
                 gotta get rid of all those cars.
                 It looks like Sam's hot car lot
                 outside.
                         (pointing to Mr.
                          Blonde)
                 You stay here and babysit Orange
                 and the cop.
                         (referring to Mr.
                          Pink and Mr. White)
                 You two take a car each, I'll
                 follow ya.  You ditch it, I'll
                 pick you up, then we'll pick up
                 the stones.  And while I'm
                 following you, I'll arrange for
                 some sort of a doctor for our
                 friend.

                              MR. WHITE
                 We can't leave these guys with
                 him.

       Meaning Mr. Blonde.

                              EDDIE
                 Why not?

       Mr. White crosses to Mr. Blonde.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Because this guy's a fucking
                 psycho.  And if you think
                 Joe's pissed at us, that
                 ain't nothing compared to how
                 pissed off I am at him, for puttin
                 me in the same room as this
                 bastard.

                              MR. BLONDE
                         (to Eddie)
                 You see what I been puttin up
                 with?  As soon as I walk through
                 the door I'm hit with this shit.
                 I tell 'm what you told me about
                 us stayin put and Mr. White whips
                 out his gun, sticks it in my face,
                 and starts screaming "You
                 motherfucker, I'm gonna blow you
                 away, blah, blah, blah."

                              MR. WHITE
                 He's the reason the place turned
                 into a shooting gallery.
                         (to Mr. Pink)
                 What are you, a silent partner?
                 Fuckin tell him.

                              MR. PINK
                 He seems all right now, but he
                 went crazy in the store.

                              MR. WHITE
                 This is what he was doin.

       Mr. White acts out Mr. Blonde shooting everybody in the
       store.

                              MR. BLONDE
                 I told 'em not to touch the alarm.
                 They touched it.  I blew 'em full
                 of holes.  If they hadn't done
                 what I told 'em not it, they'd
                 still be alive.

                              MR. WHITE
                 That's your excuse for going on a
                 kill crazy rampage?

                              MR. BLONDE
                 I don't like alarms.

                              EDDIE
                 What does it matter who stays with
                 the cop?  We ain't lettin him go.
                 Not after he's seen everybody.
                 You should've never took him outta
                 your trunk in the first place.

                              MR. PINK
                 We were trying to find out what he
                 knew about the set up.

                              EDDIE
                 There is no fuckin set up!
                         (Eddie takes charge)
                 Look, this is the news.  Blondie,
                 you stay here and take care of
                 them two.  White and Pink come
                 with me, 'cuz if Joe gets here and
                 sees all those fucking cars
                 parked out front, he's going to be
                 as mad at me as he is at you.

       Eddie, Mr. White and Mr. Pink walk out of the warehouse
       talking amongst themselves.


22     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - MR. BLONDE AND COP

       Mr. Blonde closes the door after them.  He then slowly
       turns his head towards the cop.

                              MR. BLONDE
                 Alone at last.

       
       C.U. COP'S FACE.

                              MR. BLONDE (OS)
                 Now where were we?

                              COP
                 I told you I don't know anything
                 about any fucking set up.  I've
                 only been on the force eight
                 months, nobody tells me anything!
                 I don't know anything!  You can
                 torture me if you want--

                              MR. BLONDE (OS)
                 --Thanks, don't mind if I do.

                              COP
                 Your boss even said there wasn't a
                 set up.

                              MR. BLONDE (OS)
                 First off, I don't have a boss.
                 Are you clear about that?

       He SLAPS the cop's face.

                              MR. BLONDE (OS)
                 I asked you a question.  Are you
                 clear about that?

                              COP
                 Yes.

                              MR. BLONDE (OS)
                 Now I'm not gonna bullshit you.  I
                 don't really care about what you
                 know or don't know.  I'm gonna
                 torture you for awhile regardless.
                 Not to get information, but
                 because torturing a cop amuses me.
                 There's nothing you can say,
                 there's nothing you can do.
                 Except pray for death.

       He puts a piece of tape over the cop's mouth.


       COP'S POV

       Mr. Blonde walks away from the cop.

                              MR. BLONDE
                 Let's see what's on K-BILLY'S
                 "super sounds of the seventies"
                 weekend.

       He turns on the radio.

       Stealer's Wheel's hit "Stuck in the Middle with You" PLAYS
       over the speaker.

       NOTE: This entire sequence is timed to the music.

       Mr. Blonde slowly walks toward the cop.

       He opens a large knife.

       He grabs a chair, places it in front of the cop and sits
       in it.

       Mr. Blonde just stares into the cop's/our face, holding
       the knife, singing along with the song.

       Then, like a cobra, he LASHES out.

       A SLASH across the face.

       The cop/camera moves around wildly.

       Mr. Blonde just stares into the cop's/our face, singing
       along with the seventies hit.

       Then he reaches out and CUTS OFF the cop's/our ear.

       The cop/camera moves around wildly.

       Mr. Blonde holds the ear up to the cop/us to see.

       Mr. Blonde rises, kicking the chair he was sitting on out
       of the way.


23     INT./EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - HANDHELD SHOT

       We follow Mr Blonde as he walks out of the warehouse...

       ...to his car.  He opens the trunk, pulls out a large can
       of gasoline.

       He walks back inside the warehouse...


24     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

       ...carrying the can of gas.

       Mr. Blonde POURS the gasoline all over the cop, who's
       BEGGING him not to do this.

       Mr. Blonde just sings along with Stealer's Wheel.

       Mr. Blonde LIGHTS up a match and, while mouthing:

                              MR. BLONDE
                 "Clowns to the left of me,
                 Jokers to the right.  Here I am,
                 stuck in the middle with you."

       He moves the match up to the cop...

       ...When a bullet EXPLODES in Mr. Blonde's chest.

       The HANDHELD camera WHIPS to the right and we see the
       bloody Mr. Orange FIRING his gun.

       We cut back and forth between Mr. Blonde taking BULLET
       HITS and Mr. Orange emptying his weapon.

       Mr. Blonde FALLS down dead.

       Mr. Orange crawls to where the cop is, leaving a bloody
       trail behind him.

       When he reaches the cop's feet he looks up at him.

                              MR. ORANGE
                         (feebly)
                 What's your name?

                              COP
                 Jeffrey.

                              MR. ORANGE
                 Jeffrey what?

                              COP
                 Jeffrey Andrews.

                              MR. ORANGE
                 Listen to me, Jeffrey
                 Andrews.  I'm a cop.

                              JEFFREY
                 I know.

                              MR. ORANGE
                         (surprised)
                 You do?

                              JEFFREY
                 Your name's Freddy something.

                              MR. ORANGE
                 Freddy Newendyke.

                              JEFFREY
                 Frankie Ferchetti introduced us
                 once, about five months ago.

                              MR. ORANGE
                 Shit.  I don't remember that at
                 all.

                              JEFFREY
                 I do.
                         (pause)
                 How do I look?

       The gun-shot Mr. Orange looks at the kid's GASHED face and
       the hole in the side of his head where his ear used to be.

                              MR. ORANGE
                 I don't know what to tell you
                 Jeffrey.

       Jeffrey starts to weep.

                              JEFFREY
                 That fucking bastard!  That
                 fucking sick fucking bastard!

                              MR. ORANGE
                 Jeffrey, I need you to hold on.
                 There's officers positioned and
                 waiting to move in a block away.

                              JEFFREY
                         (screaming)
                 What the fuck are they waiting
                 for?  That motherfucker cut off my
                 ear!  He slashed my face!  I'm
                 deformed!

                              MR. ORANGE
                 And I'm dying.  They don't know
                 that.  All they know is they're
                 not to make a move until Joe Cabot
                 shows up.  I was sent undercover
                 to get Cabot.  You heard 'em, they
                 said he's on his way.  Don't pussy
                 out on me now, Jeffrey.  We're
                 just gonna sit here and bleed
                 until Joe
                 Cabot sticks his fuckin head
                 through that door.

                                                        CUT TO:


       INSERT: TITLE CARD  "MR. ORANGE & MR. WHITE"


25     INT.  DENNY'S - NIGHT

       A tough-looking black man named HOLDAWAY, who sports a
       Malcom X beard, a green Chairman Mao cap with a red star
       on it, and a military flack jacket, digs into a Denny
       bacon, cheese and avocado burger.  He sits in a booth all
       alone.  He's waiting for somebody.  As he waits, he
       practically empties an entire bottle of ketchup on his
       french fries, not by mistake either--that's just how he
       likes it.

       We see Mr. Orange, now known as FREDDY NEWENDYKE, wearing
       a high school letterman jacket, enter the coffee shop,
       spot Holdaway, and head his way.  Holdaway sees Freddy bop
       towards him with a wide-ass alligator grin plastered
       across his face.

       CAMERA DOLLIES FAST down AISLE to MEDIUM SHOT of Holdaway.
       We fear Freddy OFF SCREEN.

                              FREDDY (O.S.)
                 Say "hello" to a motherfucker
                 who's inside.  Cabot's doing a job
                 and take a big fat guess who he
                 wants on the team?

                              HOLDAWAY
                 This better not be some Freddy
                 joke.

       LOW ANGLE

       looking up at Freddy, who's standing at the table.

                              FREDDY
                 It ain't no joke, I'm in there.
                 I'm up his ass.

       CU ON HOLDAWAY

       Holdaway just looks at his pupil for a moment, then
       smiles.

                              HOLDAWAY
                 Congratulations.


26     EXT.  DENNY'S - NIGHT

       We see through the window of the restaurant Freddy slide
       into the booth across from Holdaway.  Freddy's doing a lot
       of talking, but we can't hear what they're saying.


27     INT.  DENNY'S - NIGHT

       FREEZE FRAME ON HOLDAWAY

       We are frozen on a MEDIUM CU of Holdaway listening to
       Freddy.  We HEAR RESTAURANT NOISE and Freddy OFF SCREEN.

                              FREDDY (O.S.)
                 Nice Guy Eddie tells me Joe wants
                 to meet me.  He says I should just
                 hang around my apartment and wait
                 for a phone call.  Well after
                 waiting three goddamn days by the
                 fuckin phone, he calls me last
                 night and says Joe's ready, and
                 he'll pick me up in fifteen
                 minutes.

       The freeze frame ENDS.  Holdaway comes suddenly up to
       speed and says:

                              HOLDAWAY
                 Woo all picked you up?

       From here to end we cut back and forth.

                              FREDDY
                 Nice Guy.  When we got to the
                 bar...

                              HOLDAWAY
                 ...What bar?

                              FREDDY
                 The Boots and Socks in Gardena.
                 When we got there, I met Joe and a
                 guy named Mr. White.  It's a phony
                 name.  My name's Mr. Orange.

                              HOLDAWAY
                 You ever seen this motherfucker
                 before?

                              FREDDY
                 Who, Mr. White?

                              HOLDAWAY
                 Yeah.

                              FREDDY
                 No, he ain't familiar.  He ain't
                 one of Cabot's soldiers either.
                 He's gotta be from outta town.
                 But Joe knows him real well.

                              HOLDAWAY
                 How can you tell?

                              FREDDY
                 The way they talk to each other.
                 You can tell they're buddies.

                              HOLDAWAY
                 Did the two of you talk?

                              FREDDY
                 Me and Mr. White?

                              HOLDAWAY
                 Yeah.

                              FREDDY
                 A little.

                              HOLDAWAY
                 What about?

                              FREDDY
                 The Brewers.

                              HOLDAWAY
                 The Milwaukee Brewers?

                              FREDDY
                 Yeah.  They had just won the night
                 before, and he made a killing off
                 'em.

                              HOLDAWAY
                 Well, if this crook's a Brewers
                 fan, his ass has gotta be from
                 Wisconsin.  And I'll bet you
                 everything from a diddle-eyed Joe
                 to a damned-if-I-know, that in
                 Milwaukee they got a sheet on this
                 Mr. White motherfucker's ass.  I
                 want you to go through the mugs of
                 guys from old Milwaukee with a
                 history of armed robbery, and put
                 a name to that face.

       Holdaway takes a big bite out of his burger.

                              HOLDAWAY
                         (with his mouth full)
                 What kinds questions did Cabot
                 ask?

                              FREDDY
                 Where I was from, who I knew, how
                 I knew Nice Guy, had I done time,
                 shit like that.

       Holdaway's talked enough, he's eating his burger now.  He
       motions for Freddy to elaborate.

                              FREDDY
                 He asked me if I ever done armed
                 robbery before.  I read him my
                 credits.  I robbed a few gas and
                 sips, sold some weed, told him
                 recently I held the shotgun while
                 me and another guy pulled down a
                 poker game in Portland.

       CAMERA MOVES from a MEDIUM on Freddy to a CU.

                              HOLDAWAY (O.S.)
                 Didja use the commode story?

                              FREDDY
                 Fuckin-A.  I tell it real good,
                 too.


28     INT.  MEN'S ROOM - L.A. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

       Freddy and Holdaway at one of their many rendezvous.
       Holdaway wears an extra large Lakers sweatshirt.  Freddy
       sits on one of the sinks, wearing his high school jacket,
       looking at pieces of paper stapled together.

                              FREDDY
                 What's this?

                              HOLDAWAY
                 It's a scene.  Memorize it.

                              FREDDY
                 What?

                              HOLDAWAY
                 A undercover cop has got to be
                 Marlon Brando.  To do this job you
                 got to be a great actor.  You got
                 to be naturalistic.  You got to be
                 naturalistic as hell.  If you
                 ain't a great actor you're a bad
                 actor, and bad acting is bull shit
                 in this job.

                              FREDDY
                         (referring to the
                          papers)
                 But what is this?

                              HOLDAWAY
                 It's a amusing anecdote about a
                 drug deal.

                              FREDDY
                 What?

                              HOLDAWAY
                 Something funny that happened to
                 you while you were doing a job.

                              FREDDY
                 I gotta memorize all this shit?

                              HOLDAWAY
                 It's like a joke.  You remember
                 what's important, and the rest you
                 make your own.  The only way to
                 make it your own is to keep sayin
                 it, and sayin it, and sayin it,
                 and sayin it, and sayin it.

                              FREDDY
                 I can do that.

                              HOLDAWAY
                 The things you gotta remember are
                 the details.  It's the details
                 that sell your story.  Now this
                 story takes place in this men's
                 room.  So you gotta know the
                 details about this men's room.
                 You gotta know they got a blower
                 instead of a towel to dry your
                 hands.  You gotta know the stalls
                 ain't got no doors.  You gotta
                 know whether they got liquid or
                 powdered soap, whether they got
                 hot water or not, 'cause if you do
                 your job when you tell your story,
                 everybody should believe it.  And
                 if you tell your story to somebody
                 who's actually taken a piss in
                 this men's room, and you get one
                 detail they remember right,
                 they'll swear by you.


29     INT.  FREDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY

       Freddy paces back and forth, in and out of frame,
       rehearsing the anecdote.  He's reading it pretty good, but
       he's still reading it from the page, and every once in a
       while he stumbles over his words.

                              FREDDY
                 ...this was during the Los Angeles
                 marijuana drought of '86.  I still
                 had a connection.  Which was
                 insane, 'cause you couldn't get
                 weed anyfuckinwhere then.  Anyway,
                 I had a connection with this
                 hippie chick up in Santa Cruz.
                 All and my friends knew it.  And
                 they'd give me a call and say,
                 "Hey, Freddy, you buyin some, you
                 think you could buy me some too?"
                 They knew I smoked, so they'd ask
                 me to buy a little for them when I
                 was buyin.  But it got to be
                 everytime I bought some weed, I
                 was buyin for four or five
                 different people.  Finally I said,
                 "Fuck this shit."  I'm makin this
                 bitch rich.  She didn't have to do
                 jack shit, she never even had to
                 meet these people.  I was fuckin
                 doin all the work.  So I got
                 together with her and told her,
                 "Hey, I'm sick of this shit.  I'm
                 comin through for everybody, and
                 nobody's comin through for me.
                 So, either I'm gonna tell all my
                 friends to find their own source,
                 or you give me a bunch of weed,
                 I'll sell it to them, give you the
                 money, minus ten percent, and I
                 get my pot for free."  So, I did
                 if for awhile...

       Freddy exits frame

30     EXT.  PARKING LOT - DAY

       Another empty frame, except obviously outside.  Freddy
       enters frame from the same direction he exited in the
       previous scene, finishing his sentence.  When we move to a
       wider shot we see Freddy performing his monolog to
       Holdaway in a parking lot.  Holdaway sits on the hood of
       his beat-up car.  Freddy paces back and forth as he
       performs his story.

                              FREDDY
                 ...but then that got to be a pain
                 in the ass.  People called me on
                 the phone all the fuckin time.  I
                 couldn't rent a fuckin tape
                 without six phone calls
                 interrupting me.  "Hey, Freddy,
                 when's the next time you're gettin
                 some?"  "Motherfucker, I'm tryin
                 to watch 'Lost Boys'-- when I have
                 some, I'll let you know."  And
                 then these rinky-dink pot heads
                 come by--there's my friends and
                 everything, but still.  I got all
                 my shit laid out in sixty dollar
                 bags.  Well, they don't want sixty
                 dollars worth.  They want ten
                 dollars worth.  Breaking it up is
                 a major fuckin pain in the ass.  I
                 don't even know how much ten
                 dollars worth is.  "Well, fuck,
                 man, I don't want that much
                 around.  If I have that much
                 around I'll smoke it."  "Hey, if
                 you guys can't control your
                 smokin, that's not my problem.
                 You motherfuckers been smokin for
                 five years, be a adult about it."
                 Finally I just told my connection,
                 count me out.  But as it turns
                 out, I'm the best guy she had, and
                 she depended alot on my business.
                 But I was still sick to death of
                 it.  And she's trying to talk me
                 into not quitin.
                 Now this was a very weird
                 situation, 'cause I don't know if
                 you remember back in '86, there
                 was a major fuckin drought.
                 Nobody and anything.  People were
                 livin on resin and smokin the wood
                 in their pipes for months.  And
                 this chick had a bunch, and was
                 beggin me to sell it.  So I told
                 her I wasn't gonna be Joe the Pot
                 Man anymore.  But I would take a
                 little bit and sell it to my
                 close, close, close friends.  She
                 agreed to that, and said we'd keep
                 the same arrangement as before,
                 ten percent and free pot for me,
                 as long as I helped her out that
                 weekend.  She had a brick of weed
                 she was sellin, and she didn't
                 want to go to the buy alone...

31     INT.  BOOTS AND SOCKS BAR - NIGHT

       Freddy, Joe, Nice Guy Eddie and Mr. White all sit around a
       table in a red-lighted smokey bar.  Freddy continues his
       story.  The crooks are enjoying the hell out of it.

                              FREDDY
                 ...Her brother usually goes with
                 her, but he's in county
                 unexpectedly.

                              MR. WHITE
                 What for?

                              FREDDY
                 Traffic tickets gone to warrant.
                 They stopped him for something,
                 found the warrants on 'im, took
                 'im to jail.  She doesn't want to
                 walk around alone with all that
                 weed.  Well, I don't wanna do
                 this, I have a bad feeling about
                 it, but she keeps askin me, keeps
                 askin me, finally I said okay
                 'cause I'm sick of listening to
                 it.  Well, we're picking this guy
                 up at the train station.

                              JOE
                 You're picking the buyer up at the
                 train station?  You're carrying
                 the weed on you?

                              FREDDY
                 Yeah, the guy needed it right
                 away.  Don't ask me why.  So we
                 get to the train station, and
                 we're waitin for the guy.  Now I'm
                 carrying the weed in one of those
                 carry-on bags, and I gotta take a
                 piss.  So I tell the connection
                 I'll be right back, I'm goin' to

       MEDIUM ON FREDDY

       He walks through the door with a carry-on bag over his
       shoulder.  Once he's inside, he stops in his tracks.  We
       move into a CU.

                              FREDDY (V.O.)
                 ...So I walk into the men's room,
                 and who's standing there?

       FREEZE FRAME

       on Freddy standing in front of six Los Angeles County
       Sheriffs and one German Shepherd.  All of their eyes are

                 ...six Los Angeles County Sheriffs
                 and a German Shepherd.

                              NICE GUY EDDIE (V.O.)
                 They were waiting for you?

                              FREDDY (V.O.)
                 No.  They were just a bunch of
                 cops hangin out in the men's room,
                 talkin.  When I walked through the
                 door they all stopped what they
                 were talking about and looked at
                 me.

                 hard situation.

       ECU GERMAN SHEPHERD

       barking his head off.

                              FREDDY (V.O.)
                 The German Shepherd starts
                 barkin'.  He's barkin' at me.  I
                 mean it's obvious he's barkin' at
                 me.

       We do a slow 360 around Freddy in the men's room.  We can
       hear the dog barking.

                              FREDDY (V.O.)
                 Every nerve ending, all of my
                 senses, the blood in my veins,
                 everything I has was screaming,
                 "Take off, man, just take off, get
                 the fuck outta there!"  Panic hit
                 me like a bucket of water.  First
                 there was the shock of it--BAM,
                 right in the face!  Then I'm just
                 standin there drenched in panic.

       CAMERA does a PAN from face to face of the sheriffs.

                              FREDDY (V.O.)
                 And all those sheriffs are lookin
                 at me and they know. They can
                 smell it.  As sure as that fuckin
                 dog cam, they can smell it on me.

       FREEZE FRAME

       Back to the same freeze frame shot of Freddy standing in
       front of the sheriffs.  It suddenly jerks to life, and
       moves to speed.  The dog is barking.  Freddy moves to his
       right, out of frame.  We stay on the sheriffs.  One
       sheriff yells at the dog.

                              SHERIFF #1
                 Shut up!

       The dog quiets down.  Sheriff #2 continues with his story.
       A couple of the sheriffs look over at Freddy off screen,
       but as Sheriff #2 talks, turn their attention to him.

                              SHERIFF #2
                 So my gun's drawn, right?  I got
                 it aimed right at him.  I tell
                 'em, "Freeze, don't fuckin move."
                 And the little idiot's lookin at
                 me, nodding his head "Yes," sayin
                 "I know...I know...I know."
                 Meanwhile his right hand is
                 creepin towards his glove box.  So
                 I scream at him, "Asshole, you
                 better fuckin freeze right now!"
                 And he's still lookin right at me,
                 saying
                 "I know...I know...I know."  And
                 his right hand's still going for
                 the glove box.

       The CAMERA PANS away from the sheriffs to Freddy, up
       against the urinal, playing possum, pretending to piss.

                              SHERIFF #2 (O.S.)
                 I tell 'im, "Buddy, I'm gonna
                 shoot you in the face right now if
                 you don't put your hands on the
                 fuckin dash."  And the guy's
                 girlfriend, a real sexy Oriental
                 bitch, starts screamin at him,
                 "Chuck, are you out of your mind?
                 Put your hands on the dash like
                 the officer said."  And then like
                 nothing, the guy snaps out of it
                 and casually puts his hands on the
                 dash.

       Freddy finishes his playing possum piss, and walks past
       the sheriffs over to the sink.  The CAMERA PANS with him.
       A sheriff is sitting on a sink.  He looks down and watches
       Freddy wash his hands.

                              SHERIFF #1
                 What was he goin for?

                              SHERIFF #2
                 His registration.  Stupid fuckin
                 citizen, doesn't have the
                 slightest idea how close he came
                 to gettin shot.

       Freddy finishes washing his hands.  He goes to dry them,
       but there's only those hand drying machines.  Freddy turns
       on the drying machine.  He can't hear anything the
       sheriffs say now.  The sound of the machine dominates the
       sound track.

       These following shots are SLOW MOTION.

36     INT. HOLDAWAY'S OFFICE - DAY

       Holdaway sits behind his desk.  Freddy sits on the edge of
       the desk eating a Double-Double with cheese.  They look
       into the CAMERA.

       We hear Jodie's voice OFFSCREEN.

                              JODIE (OS)
                 Lawrence "Larry" Dimick.  Also
                 known as Lawrence Jacobs and Alvin
                 "Al" Jacobs.  This guy is Mr. Joe-
                 Armed-Robbery.  He's
                 a pro and he makes it a habit not
                 to get caught.

                              JODIE
                 He's only been convicted twice,
                 which is pretty good for somebody
                 living a life of crime.  Once for
                 armed robbery, when he was twenty-
                 one, in Milwaukee.

                 months.  He didn't get busted
                 again until he was thirty-two.
                 And then it was a backdoor bust.

                 of choice.  Also, on his finger is
                 a diamond ring from a jewelry
                 store robbery a year earlier.  He
                 got two years back inside for
                 that.

       JODIE

                              JODIE
                 No.  The vice squad roust was in
                 L.A.  He's been in Los Angeles
                 since '77.


       DOLLY BEHIND HOLDAWAY'S DESK

       from left to right.

                              FREDDY
                 When did he do this time?

                              JODIE
                 Back in '83, got out late '86.  I
                 found something else out I think
                 you two should be aware of.
                 About a year and a half ago, up in
                 Sacramento, an undercover cop,
                 John Dolenz, worked his way into a
                 bank job.  Apparently before the
                 job they found out he was a cop.
                 Now picture this:  It's Dolenz's
                 birthday, a bunch of cops are
                 waiting in his apartment for a
                 surprise party.  The door opens,
                 everyone yells "Surprise!", and
                 standing in the doorway is Dolenz
                 and this other guy sticking a gun
                 in Dolenz's ribs.  Before anybody
                 knows what's going on, this
                 stranger shoots Dolenz dead and
                 starts firing two .45 automatics
                 into the crowd.

                              HOLDAWAY
                 What happened?

       The DOLLY moves behind Jodie.

                              JODIE
                 It was a mess.  Cops got hit,
                 wives got hit, girlfriends got
                 hit, his dog got hit.  People got
                 glass in their faces.  Three were
                 killed, six were wounded.

                              FREDDY
                 They couldn't pin the killing on
                 one of the bank robbers?

                              JODIE
                 They tried, but they didn't have a
                 positive I.D. and all those guys
                 had alibis.  Besides, we really
                 didn't have anything on them.  We
                 had the testimony of a dead man
                 that they were talking
                 about committing a robbery.  They
                 never went ahead with the bank
                 job.

       The DOLLY completes its circle.

                              FREDDY
                 And Larry Dimick was one of the
                 boys?

                              JODIE
                 He was probably the one.

       It RINGS.  Freddy answers it, we FOLLOW the receiver up to

                         (through phone)
                 I'll be right down.

       We hear the CLICK of Freddy hanging up through the phone.
       Nice Guy places the receiver back in its cradle.

                              EDDIE
                 He'll be right down.


39     INT. FREDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY

       The CAMERA follows Freddy as he hops around the
       apartment getting everything he needs.  He puts on
       his jacket and slips on some sneakers.

       DOLLY fast toward the front door knob.  Freddy's hand
       comes into FRAME, grabs the knob, then lets go.  We MOVE
       UP to his face.

       Fear.

                              FREDDY
                         (to himself)
                 Don't pussy out on me now.  They
                 don't know.  They don't know shit.
                         (pause)
                 You're not gonna get hurt.  You're
                 fucking Baretta and they believe
                 every word, cuz
                 you're super cool.

       He exits FRAME. We stay put and hear the door open and
       close OFF SCREEN.

       From inside an unmarked car across the street, the TWO
       COPS watching Freddy see him walk out of his building and
       up to Eddie's parked car.

                              COP #1 (OS)
                 There goes our boy.

                              COP #2 (OS)
                 I swear, a guy has to have rocks
                 in his head the size of Gibraltar
                 to work undercover.

                              COP #1 (OS)
                 Do you want one of these?

                              COP #2 (OS)
                 Yeah, gimme the bear claw.

       Freddy gets into the car and it pulls into traffic.

       Cop #1 starts the engine and follows.


41     INT. NICE GUY EDDIE'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

       Nice Guy Eddie is behind the wheel.  Mr. Pink is
       in the passenger seat.  Freddy and Mr. White are in the
       backseat together.

                              MR. PINK
                 ...Hey, I know what I'm talkin
                 about, black women ain't the same
                 as white women.

                              MR. WHITE
                         (sarcastically)
                 There's a slight difference.

       The car laughs.

                              MR. PINK 
                 Go ahead and laugh, you know what
                 I mean.  What a while bitch will
                 put up with, a black bitch won't
                 put up with for a minute.  They
                 got a line, and if you cross it,
                 they fuck you up.

                              EDDIE
                 I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on
                 this.  I've seen it happen.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Okay, Mr. Expert. If this is such
                 a truism, how come every nigger I
                 know treats his woman like a piece
                 of shit?

                              MR. PINK
                 I'll make you a bet that those
                 same damn niggers who were showin
                 their ass in public, when their
                 bitches get 'em home, they chill
                 the fuck out.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Not these guys.

                              MR. PINK
                 Yeah, those guys too.

                              EDDIE
                 Let me tell you guys a story.  In
                 one of daddy's clubs there was
                 this black cocktail waitress named
                 Elois.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Elois?

                              EDDIE
                 Yeah, Elois. E and Lois.  We
                 called her Lady E.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Where was she from, Compton?

                              EDDIE
                 No.  She was from Ladora Heights.

                              MR. PINK
                 The black Beverly Hills.  I knew
                 this lady from Ladora Heights
                 once.
                         (in a stuck up black
                          female voice)
                 "Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's
                 the black Beverly Hills."
                              EDDIE
                 It's not the black Beverly Hills,
                 it's the black Palos Verdes.
                 Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a
                 man-eater-upper.  I bet every guy
                 who's ever met her has jacked off
                 to her at least once.  You know
                 who she looked like?  Christie
                 Love.  'Member that TV show "Get
                 Christie Love"?  She was a black
                 female cop.  She always used to
                 say "You're under arrest, sugar."

                              MR. PINK
                 I was in the sixth grade when that
                 show was on.  I totally dug it.
                 What the fuck was the name of the
                 chick who played Christie
                 Love?

                              EDDIE
                 Pam Grier.

                              MR. PINK
                 No, it wasn't Pan Grier, Pan Grier
                 was the other one.  Pan Grier made
                 the movies.  Christie Love was
                 like a Pam Grier TV show, without
                 Pam Grier.

                              MR. PINK
                 What the fuck was that chick's
                 name?  Oh this is just great, I'm
                 totally fuckin tortured now.

                              EDDIE
                 Well, whoever she was, Elois
                 looked like her.  So one night I
                 walk into the club, and no Elois.
                 Now the bartender was a wetback,
                 he was a friend of mine, his name
                 was Carlos.
                 So I asked him "Hey, Carlos,
                 where's Lady E tonight?"  Well
                 apparently Lady E was married to
                 this real piece of dog shit.  I
                 mean a real animal.  And
                 apparently he would so things to
                 her.

                              FREDDY

                 Do things?  What would he do?  You
                 mean like beat her up?

                              EDDIE
                 Nobody knows for sure what he did.
                 We just know he did something.
                 Anyway, Elois plays it real cool.
                 And waits for the next time this
                 bag of shit gets drunk.  So one
                 night the guy gets drunk and
                 passes out on the couch.  So while
                 the guy's
                 inebriated, she strips him naked.
                 Then she takes some crazy glue and
                 glues his dick to his belly.

       The car reacts to how horrible that would be.

                              EDDIE
                 I'm dead fuckin serious.  She put
                 some on his dick and some on his
                 belly, then stuck 'em together.
                 The paramedics had to come and cut
                 it loose.

       The car reacts badly.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Jesus Christ!

                              FREDDY
                 You can do some crazy things with
                 it.

                              EDDIE
                 I don't know what he did to her,
                 but she got even.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Was he all pissed off?

                              MR. PINK
                 How would you feel if you had to
                 do a handstand every time you took
                 a piss.

       The car laughs.


42     EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

       Nice Guy Eddie pulls up outside the warehouse.
       The four men climb out of the car and follow Eddie inside.


43     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

       The four men enter the building.

       At the other end of the warehouse, sitting in chairs, are
       Mr. Blonde, Mr. Brown, Mr. Blue and Joe Cabot.

       We shoot this from OVERHEAD, looking down on the men.

                              JOE
                         (to everybody)
                 ...So they're talkin about how
                 they get their wives off, and the
                 French guys says:
                        (in a bad French
                         accent)
                 "All I gotta do is take my pinky
                 and tickle my Fifi's little oo la
                 la  and she rises a foot off the
                 bed."

       Back to Joe.

                 So the dago says:


       CU ON JOE

                              JOE
                          (in a good Brooklyn
                           accent)
                 "That's nothin.  When I take the
                 tip of my tongue and wiggle it
                 against my Mary Louise's little
                 fun pimple, she rises two feet off
                 da bed."  Then our friend from
                 Poland says:
                         (in dumb voice)
                 "You guys ain't no cocksmen. When
                 I get through fuckin my Sophie, I
                 wipe my dick on the curtains and
                 you know what?  She hits the
                 roof!"

       Joe laughs like a crazy man.

                              JOE
                 Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

       We hear a lot of laughing OFF SCREEN.

                              JOE
                 Ain't that a masterpiece?  Stupid
                 fuckin Polack, wipes his dick on
                 the drapes.

       Joe's eyes greet the new arrivals.

                              JOE
                 You're here, great!

       Joe EXITS C.U.

       We now have everybody from the Uncle Bob's Pancake House
       scene together again.  Some sit on folding chairs, some
       stand.  Joe sits in front of them on the edge of a table.
       A blackboard with a layout of the jewelry store is off to
       the right.

       We do a 360 around the men.

                              EDDIE
                 We woulda gotten here sooner, but
                 we got backed up around La Brea
                 and Pico.

                              JOE
                 No hurry.
                         (to the boys)
                 All right, let's get to know one
                 another.  With the exception of
                 Eddie and myself, who you already
                 know, you'll be using aliases.
                 Under no circumstances are you to
                 tell one another your real name or
                 anything else about yourself.
                 That includes where you're from,
                 your wife's name, where you
                 might've done time, about a bank
                 in St. Petersburg you might've
                 robbed.  You guys don't say shit
                 about who you are, where you been
                 or what you've done.  Only thing
                 you guys can talk about is what
                 you're going to do.  This way the
                 only ones who know who the members
                 of the team are are Eddie and
                 myself.  And that's the way I like
                 it.  Because in the unlikely event
                 of one of you getting apprehended
                 by the cops, not that I expect
                 that to happen - it most
                 definitely should not happen - it
                 hasn't happened, you don't have
                 anything to deal with.  You don't
                 know any names.  You know my name,
                 you know Eddie's name.  That I
                 don't care about.  You gotta prove
                 it.  I ain't worried.  Besides,
                 this way you gotta trust me.  I
                 like that.  I set this up and
                 picked the men I wanted for it.
                 None of you came to me, I
                 approached all of you.  I know
                 you.  I know your work, I know
                 your reputation.  I know you as
                 men.  Except for this guy.

       Joe points a finger at Freddy.

       Freddy shits a brick.

                              JOE
                 But he's OK.  If he wasn't OK, he
                 wouldn't be here.  Okay, let me
                 introduce everybody to everybody.
                 But once again, at the risk of
                 being redundant, if I even think I
                 hear somebody telling or referring
                 to somebody by their Christian
                 name...
                         (Joe searches for the
                          right words)
                 ...you won't want to be you.
                 Okay, quickly.
                         (pointing at the men
                          as he gives them a
                          name)
                 Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde,
                 Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr.
                 Pink.

                              MR. PINK
                 Why am I Mr. Pink?

                              JOE
                 Cause you're a faggot.

       Everybody laughs.

                              MR. PINK
                 Why can't we pick out our own
                 colors?

                              JOE
                 I tried that once, it don't work.
                 You get four guys fighting over
                 who's gonna be Mr. Black.  Since
                 nobody knows anybody else, nobody
                 wants to back down.  So forget it,
                 I pick.  Be thankful you're not
                 Mr. Yellow.

                              MR. BROWN
                 Yeah, but Mr. Brown?  That's too
                 close to Mr. Shit.

       Everybody laughs.

                              MR. PINK
                 Yeah, Mr. Pink sounds like Mr.
                 Pussy.  Tell you what, let me be
                 Mr. Purple.  That sounds good to
                 me, I'm Mr. Purple.

                              JOE
                 You're not Mr. Purple, somebody
                 from another job's Mr. Purple.
                 You're Mr. Pink.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Who cares what your name is?  Who
                 cares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr.
                 Purple, Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss...

                              MR. PINK
                 Oh that's really easy for you to
                 say, you're Mr. White.  You gotta
                 cool-sounding name.  So tell me,
                 Mr. White, if you think "Mr. Pink"
                 is no big deal, you wanna trade?

                              JOE
                 Nobody's trading with anybody!
                 Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin
                 city counsel meeting!  Listen up
                 Mr. Pink.  We got two ways here,
                 my way or the highway.  And you
                 can go down either of 'em.  So
                 what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?

                              MR. PINK
                 Jesus Christ, Joe.  Fuckin forget
                 it.  This is beneath me.  I'm Mr.
                 Pink, let's move on.

       CAMERA leaves the team and goes to the blackboard
       with the layout of the jewelry store on it.

                              JOE (OS)
                 Okay fellas, let's get into this.

                                                        CUT TO:


44     EXT. BLEACHERS - DAY

       Freddy and Holdaway sit on some bleachers in an empty
       little league baseball field.

                              HOLDAWAY
                 Okay, we're gonna station men
                 across the street from Karina's
                 Fine Jewelry.  But their orders
                 will be not to move in unless the
                 robbery gets out of control.  You
                 gotta make sure they don't have to
                 move in.  You're inside to make
                 sure that everything goes
                 according to Hoyle.  We have men
                 set up a block away from the
                 warehouse rendezvous.  They got
                 complete visibility of the
                 exterior.  So as soon as Joe Cabot
                 shows up, we'll see it.

                              FREDDY
                 What's your visibility of the
                 interior?

                              HOLDAWAY
                 We can't see shit on the inside.
                 And we can't risk gettin any
                 closer for fear they'll spot us.

                              FREDDY
                 This is bullshit, Jim.  I get all
                 the fuckin danger of having you
                 guys in my back pocket but none of
                 the safety.

                              HOLDAWAY
                 What's the matter, Newendyke?  Job
                 too tough for ya?  No one lied to
                 you.  You always knew we'd hang
                 back until Joe Cabot showed up.

                              FREDDY
                 Oh this is great.  You ain't
                 giving me no fuckin protection
                 whatsoever.  But you are giving me
                 an attitude.

                              HOLDAWAY
                 Since when does an undercover cop
                 have protection?  Freddy, you came
                 into this thing with your eyes
                 wide open, so don't start screamin
                 blind man now.  I understand
                 you're nervous.  I wish the
                 warehouse had more visible
                 windows, but it doesn't.  We have
                 to make do with the cards we're
                 dealt.

                              FREDDY
                 I didn't say I wasn't gonna do it.
                 I'm just remarking on how shitty
                 the situation is!

                              HOLDAWAY
                 I don't mean to be harsh with ya,
                 but I've found tough love works
                 best in these situations.  We have
                 to get Joe Cabot in the company of
                 the thieves and in the same
                 vicinity as the loot.
                 We don't care about these other
                 bastards.  We're willing to offer
                 them good deals to testify against
                 Cabot.

                              FREDDY
                 Isn't this risk unorthodox?

                              HOLDAWAY
                 What?

                              FREDDY
                 Letting them go ahead with the
                 robbery?

                              HOLDAWAY
                 The whole idea behind this
                 operation is to catch Joe Cabot
                 red-handed.  We bust these hired
                 hands, we ain't accomplished shit.
                 Letting them go through with the
                 heist is a risk, but Cabot's jobs
                 are very clean.  We got people
                 surrounding the perimeter.  We got
                 a guy and a gal on the inside
                 posing as a couple shopping for
                 rings.  We could replace the
                 employees with cops, but we'd run
                 the risk of tipping 'em off.

                              FREDDY
                 That's out.  They know the faces
                 of who works what shift.

                              HOLDAWAY
                 These guys are professionals.
                 We're professionals.  It's a risk,
                 but I think it's a calculated
                 risk.


45     EXT. KARINA'S FINE JEWELRY - DAY

       We see MOS SHOTS of the outside of the jewelry store.

       CUSTOMERS coming and going.  STORE CLERKS waiting on
       customers through the windows.

       While we look at this we HEAR over the soundtrack Mr.
       White and Freddy talking OFF SCREEN.

                              MR. WHITE (VO)
                 Let's go over it.  Where are you?

                              FREDDY (VO)
                 I stand outside and guard the
                 door.  I don't let anybody come in
                 or go out.

                              MR. WHITE (VO)
                 Mr. Brown?

                              FREDDY (VO)
                 Mr. Brown stays in the car.  He's
                 parked across the street till I
                 give him the signal, then he pulls
                 up in front of the store.

                              MR. WHITE (VO)
                 Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?

                              FREDDY (VO)
                 Crowd control.  They handle
                 customers and employees in the
                 display area.


46     INT. MR. WHITE'S CAR (PARKED) - DAY

       Mr. White and Freddy sit in a car parked across the street
       from the jewelry store, staking it out.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Myself and Mr. Pink?

                              FREDDY
                 You two take the manager in the
                 back and make him give you the
                 diamonds.  We're there for those
                 stones, period.  Since no display
                 cases are being fucked with, no
                 alarms should go off.  We're out
                 of there in two minutes, not one
                 second longer.  What if the
                 manager won't give up the
                 diamonds?

                              MR. WHITE
                 When you're dealing with a store
                 like this, they're insured up the
                 ass.  They're not supposed to give
                 you and resistance
                 whatsoever.  If you get a customer
                 or an employee who thinks he's
                 Charles Bronson, take the butt of
                 your gun and smash their nose in.
                 Drops 'em right to the floor.
                 Everyone jumps, he falls down,
                 screaming, blood squirts out his
                 nose.  Freaks everybody out.
                 Nobody says fuckin shit after
                 that.  You might get some bitch
                 talk shit to ya.  But give her a
                 look, like you're gonna smash her
                 in the face next.  Watch her shut
                 the fuck up.  Now if it's a
                 manager, that's a different story.
                 The managers know better than to
                 fuck around.  So if one's givin
                 you static, he probably thinks
                 he's a real cowboy.  So what you
                 gotta do is break that son-of-a-
                 bitch in two.  If you wanna know
                 something and he won't tell you,
                 cut off one of his fingers.  The
                 little one.  Then you tell 'im his
                 thumb's next.  After that he'll
                 tell ya if he wears ladies
                 underwear.  I'm hungry, let's get
                 a taco.

                                                        CUT TO:


47     EXT. ALLEY - DAY

       It's the moment of the robbery.  The alley is empty.

       In the distance we hear all hell breaking loose.  Guns
       FIRING, people SHOUTING and SCREAMING, sirens WAILING,
       glass BREAKING...

       A car whips around the corner, into the alley.

       The doors BURST open, Freddy and Mr. White hop out.

       Freddy opens the driver's side door.  A bloody SCREAMING
       Mr. Brown FALLS out.

                              MR. BROWN
                         (screaming)
                 My eyes!  My eyes!  I'm blind, I'm
                 fucking blind!

                              FREDDY
                 You're not blind, there's just
                 blood in your eyes.

       Mr. White loads his two .45 automatics.  He RUNS to the
       end of the alley just as a police car comes into SIGHT.

       FIRING both .45's, Mr. White massacres everyone in the
       patrol car.

       Freddy, holding the dying Mr. Brown, looks on at Mr.
       White's ambush in shock.

       Mr. Brown lifts his head up, blood in his eyes.

                              MR. BROWN
                 Mr. Orange?  You're Mr. Orange,
                 aren't you?

       By the time Freddy turns his head back to him, Mr. Brown
       is dead.

       Mr. White RUNS up to Freddy.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Is he dead?

       Freddy doesn't answer, he can't.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Did he did or not?

       Freddy, scared.

                              FREDDY
                 I'm sorry.

                              MR. WHITE
                 What?  Snap out of it!

       Mr. White GRABS Freddy by the coat and YANKS him along as
       he RUNS.

       They EXIT the alley and FLEE down a street.

       A car with a FEMALE DRIVER comes up on the two men.

       Mr. White JUMPS in her path, stopping the car.  He points
       his jun at her.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Get us outta here!

       Mr. White climbs into the backseat.

       Freddy starts to climb in.

       The Female driver comes up with a gun from under her seat.

                              MR. WHITE
                 The bitch's got a gun!

       She SHOOTS Freddy in the stomach.

       On instinct Freddy brings up his gun and SHOOTS her in the
       face.


       C.U. ON FREDDY

       as he FALLS to the ground he realizes what's happened
       to him and what he's done.  SLOW MOTION.

       Mr White DRAGS the dead female driver out of the car.  He
       SHOVES Freddy in the backseat and DRIVES away.


48     INT. GETAWAY CAR (MOVING) - DAY

       Freddy holding his stomach and doubled over in pain is
       CRYING.

       We replay the scene between Freddy and Mr. White in the
       getaway car.  Except this time, we never leave Freddy.

                              MR. WHITE (OS)
                 Just hold on buddy boy.

                              FREDDY
                 I'm sorry.  I can't believe she
                 killed me...


       CUT FROM FREDDY IN THE BACKSEAT TO:


49     INT. NICE GUY EDDIE'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

       Mr. Pink is behind the wheel, Nice Guy Eddie is in the
       passenger seat going through the satchel with the
       diamonds.  Mr. White is in the backseat.  The car is
       SPEEDING back to the garage.

                              EDDIE
                         (looking through the
                          case)
                 You know, all things considered,
                 this was pretty successful.

                              MR. WHITE
                 I don't believe you just said
                 that.

                              EDDIE
                 No, it was messy as hell, but do
                 you realize how much you got away
                 with?  There's over two million
                 dollars worth of diamonds here.

                              MR. PINK
                 I love this guy.

                              EDDIE
                 Hey, what's done is done.  We can
                 all sit around and have a big cry
                 about it or we can deal with the
                 situation at hand.

                              MR. WHITE
                 The situation as hand isn't that
                 fuckin satchel.  You and Joe have
                 a responsibility to your men.

                              EDDIE
                 Hey, it's the best I could do.

                              MR. WHITE
                 The man is fucking dying.

                              EDDIE
                 And I'm telling you, Bonnie'll
                 take care of him.

                              MR. WHITE
                 He needs a doctor, not a fuckin
                 nurse.

                              EDDIE
                 Ask me how many doctors I called.
                 You wanna embarrass yourself, ask
                 me how many doctors I called.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Obviously not enough.

                              EDDIE
                 Fuck you! You gotta little black
                 book, then whip is out.  If not,
                 listen how it is.  I called three
                 doctors and couldn't get through
                 to shit.  Now, time being a
                 factor, I called Bonnie.  Sweet
                 broad, helluva broad, and a
                 registered nurse.  Told her a
                 bullshit story, upside:  she said
                 bring him to her apartment.

                              MR. WHITE
                 If he dies I'm holding you
                 personally responsible.

                              EDDIE
                 Fuck you buddy boy!  Okay, you
                 wanna play that way.  I am
                 personally leaving myself
                 vulnerable with this Bonnie
                 situation.  I don't think she'll
                 call the cops, but I don't know
                 for sure.  But me being too nice-
                 a-fuckin-guy was willin to risk
                 it.  But no fuckin more.
                         (he grabs his
                          portable phone)
                 I'm callin Bonnie back and tellin
                 her to forget it.  You take care
                 of your friend, you know so much
                 about it.

                              MR. PINK
                 Goddamnit, will you guys grow up!

                              EDDIE
                 I don't need to grow up, my
                 friend.  I am a grown up.  I'm
                 being responsible, I'm taking care
                 of business.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Cut the shit!  I don't think you
                 called anybody except some cooze
                 you once fucked, who happens to
                 wear orthopedic shoes.  And I
                 don't think that's good enough
                 care for a gut-shot man.

                              EDDIE
                 Yeah, well I don't give a flying
                 fuck what you think!

                              MR. PINK
                         (to Mr. White)
                 Look, he's not sayin this bitch is
                 gonna operate on him.  She's gonna
                 give him better attention than we
                 can until we can get a doctor.
                 Nobody's forgotten about doctors.
                 Joe'll get one in a snap.  This is
                 something we're doing in the
                 meantime.  I think both of you are
                 actin like a couple of assholes.

                              EDDIE
                 Yeah, right.  I arrange a nurse, I
                 leave myself wide open, and I'm an
                 asshole.


50     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

       MEDIUM SHOT on the door.  Nice Guy Eddie, Mr. White and
       Mr. Pink walk through it.  They stop in their tracks.

       We see what they see.  Mr. Blonde, lying on the ground,
       shot full of holes.  The cop slumped over in his chair, a
       bloody mess, Mr. Orange lying at the cop's feet, holding
       his wound.  Eddie, Mr. White and Mr. Pink walk into the
       shot.

                              EDDIE
                 What the fuck happened here?

       Eddie runs over to his friend Mr. Blonde/Toothpick Vic.

                              MR. WHITE
                         (to Mr. Orange)
                 What happened?

                              MR. ORANGE
                         (very weakly)
                 Blonde went crazy.  He slashed the
                 cop's face, cut off his ear and
                 was gonna burn him alive.

                              EDDIE
                         (yelling)
                 Who cares what he was gonna do to
                 this fuckin pig?

       Eddie whips out his gun and SHOOTS the cop.  The cop and
       the chair tip over.  Eddie stands over him and SHOOTS him
       once more.

                              EDDIE
                         (to Mr. Orange)
                 You were saying he went crazy?
                 Something like that?  Worse or
                 better?

                              MR. ORANGE
                 Look, Eddie, he was pullin a burn.
                 He was gonna kill the cop and me.
                 And when you guys walked through
                 the door, he was gonna blow you to
                 hell and make off with the
                 diamonds.

                              MR. WHITE
                         (to Eddie)
                 Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya?
                 That sick piece of shit was a
                 stone cold psycho.

                              MR. ORANGE
                         (to Eddie)
                 You could've asked the cop, if you
                 didn't just kill him.  He talked
                 about what he was going to do when
                 he was slicing him up.

                              EDDIE
                 I don't buy it.  It doesn't make
                 sense.

                              MR. WHITE
                 It makes perfect fuckin sense to
                 me.  Eddie, you didn't see how he
                 acted during the job, we did.

       Mr. Pink walks over to the cop's body.

                              MR. PINK
                 He's right about the ear, it's
                 hacked off.

                              EDDIE
                         (to Mr. Orange)
                 Let me say this out loud, just to
                 get it straight in my mind.
                 According to you, Mr. Blonde was
                 gonna kill you.  Then when we came
                 back, kill us, grab the diamonds,
                 and scram.  That's your story?
                 I'm correct about that, right?

                              MR. ORANGE
                 Eddie, you can believe me or not
                 believe me, but it's the truth.  I
                 swear on my mother's eternal soul
                 that's what happened.

       The CAMERA mover into a C.U. of Nice Guy Eddie.

       There's a long pause while he rolls over what Mr. Orange
       has said.  Finally:

                              EDDIE
                 You're a fuckin liar.  Now why
                 don't you drop the fuckin fairy
                 tale and tell me what really
                 happened?

                              MR. WHITE (OS)
                 He told you what really happened.
                 You just can't deal with it.

                              MR. ORANGE (OS)
                 Okay, you're right, I'm lying.
                 Even though I'm fuckin dyin I'm
                 not above pullin a fast one.  Get
                 rid of Blonde, we share his split
                 - no, scratch that, I shot him
                 'cause I didn't like his hair
                 style.  I didn't like his shoes
                 either.  If it has just been his
                 hair, I'd've maybe, maybe I said,
                 let him live.  But hair and
                 footwear together, he's a goner.

                              EDDIE
                 The man you killed was just
                 released from prison.  He got
                 caught at a company warehouse full
                 of hot items.  He could've walked
                 away.  All he had to do was say my
                 dad's name.  But instead he shut
                 his mouth and did his time.  He
                 did four years for us, and he did
                 'em like a man.  And we were very
                 grateful.  So, Mr. Orange, you're
                 tellin me this very good friend of
                 mine, who did four years for my
                 father, who in four years never
                 made a deal, no matter what they
                 dangled in front of him, you're
                 telling me that now, that now this
                 man is free, and we're making good
                 on our commitment to him, he's
                 just gonna decide, right out of
                 the fuckin blue, to rip us off?

       Silence.

                              EDDIE
                 Mr. Orange, why don't you tell me
                 what really happened?

                              VOICE (OS)
                 Why?  It'll just be more bullshit.

       Eddie steps out of his C.U. and we see Joe Cabot standing
       in the warehouse doorway.  He walks into the room.

                              JOE
                         (pointing to Mr.
                          Orange)
                 This man set us up.

       CAMERA does a 360 around the men.

                              EDDIE
                 Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know
                 what's happening.

                              JOE
                 That's okay, Eddie, I do.

                              MR. WHITE
                         (to Joe)
                 What the fuck are you talking
                 about?

                              JOE
                         (pointing to Mr.
                          Orange)
                 That piece of shit.  Workin with
                 the cops.

                              MR. WHITE   MR. PINK   EDDIE
                 What?

                              JOE
                 I said this lump of shit is workin
                 with the LAPD.


       MR. ORANGE'S POV

       Looking up from the floor at everybody.

       Joe looks down at Mr. Orange.

                              JOE
                 Aren't you?

                              MR. ORANGE (OS)
                 I don't have the slightest fuckin
                 idea what you're talkin about.

                              MR. WHITE
                         (very calmly to Joe)
                 Joe, I don't know what you think
                 you know, but you're wrong.

                              JOE
                 Like hell I am.

                              MR. WHITE
                         (very calmly)
                 Joe, trust me on this, you've made
                 a mistake.  He's a good kid. I
                 understand you're hot, you're
                 super-fuckin pissed.  We're all
                 real emotional.  But you're
                 barking up the wrong tree.  I know
                 this man, and he wouldn't do that.

                              JOE
                 You don't know jack shit.  I do.
                 This rotten bastard tipped off the
                 cops and got Mr. Brown and Mr.
                 Blue killed.

                              MR. PINK
                 Mr. Blue's dead?

                              JOE
                 Dead as Dillinger.

                              EDDIE
                 The motherfucker killed Vic.

                              MR. WHITE
                 How do you know all this?

                              JOE
                 He was the only one I wasn't a
                 hundred percent on.  I should have
                 my fucking head examined for goin
                 forward when I wasn't a hundred
                 percent.  But he seemed like a
                 good kid, and I was impatient and
                 greedy and all the things that
                 fuck you up.

                              MR. WHITE
                         (screaming)
                 That's your proof?

                              JOE
                 You don't need proof when you got
                 instinct.  I ignored it before,
                 but not no more.

       He WHIPS out a revolver and aims it at Mr. Orange.

       Mr. White brings his .45 up at Joe.

       Eddie and Mr. Pink are shook awake by the flash of
       firearms.

       Eddie raises his gun, pointing it at Mr. White.

                              EDDIE
                 Have you lost your fucking mind?
                 Put your gun down!

       Mr. Pink fades into the B.G., wanting no part of this.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Joe, you're making a terrible
                 mistake I can't let you make.

                              EDDIE
                 Stop pointing your fuckin gun at
                 daddy!

       Joe, never taking his eyes off Mr. Orange.

                              JOE
                 Don't worry, Eddie.  Me and Larry
                 have been friends a long time, he
                 ain't gonna shoot.  We like each
                 other too much.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Joe, if you kill that man, you die
                 next.  Repeat, if you kill that
                 man, you die next!

       We get many different angles of the Mexican standoff.


       MEDIUMS ON EVERYBODY

       Mr. Orange holding his belly, looking from left to right.

       Joe pointing down on Mr. Orange.  Not taking his eyes off
       him.

       Mr. White pointing at Joe, looking like he's ready to
       start firing any minute.

       Eddie scared shitless for his father, gun locked on Mr.
       White.

       Mr. Pink walking backwards away from the action.

       Nobody says nothing.


       FOUR SHOT

       of guys ready for violence.  Mr. Pink in the B.G.

                              MR. PINK
                 C'mon, guys, nobody wants this.
                 We're supposed to me fuckin
                 professionals!

       Joe raises his head to Mr. White.

                              JOE
                 Larry, I'm gonna kill him.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do
                 this!

                              JOE
                 Larry, I'm askin you to trust me
                 on this.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Don't ask me that.

                              JOE
                 I'm not askin, I'm betting.

       Joe's eyes go back to Mr. Orange.

                              EDDIE
                 Daddy, don't!

       Joe FIRES three times, HITTING Mr. Orange with every one.

       Mr. White SHOOTS Joe twice in the face.  Joe brings his
       hands up to his face, screaming, and falls to the ground.

       Eddie FIRES at Mr. White, HITTING him three times in the
       chest.

       Mr. White brings his gun around on Eddie and SHOOTS him.

       The two men FALL to their knees, FIRING at each other.

       Eddie COLLAPSES, dead.

       Joe's dead.

       Mr. Orange lies perfectly still, except for his chest
       heaving.  The only SOUND we hear is his loud breathing.

       Mr. White is SHOT full of holes, but still on his knees,
       not moving.

       Mr. Pink is standing motionless.  Finally he grabs the
       satchel of diamonds and RUNS out the door.

       We hear outside a CAR START.  Then the SOUND of a BULLHORN
       yells out:

                              POLICE FORCE (OS)
                 Freeze! Get out of the car and lie
                 face down on the ground!

                              MR. PINK (OS)
                 Don't shoot!

       We now hear SIRENS, the SOUNDS of more CARS DRIVING UP,
       MEN RUNNING to the warehouse.

       While all this noise is going on, Mr. White tries to stand
       but FALLS DOWN.  He somehow makes it to where Mr. Orange
       lies.

       He lifts Mr. Orange's head, cradling it in his lap and
       stroking his brow.

                              MR. WHITE
                         (with much effort)
                 Sorry, kid.  Looks like we're
                 gonna do a little time.

       Mr. Orange looks up at him and, with even more of an
       effort:

                              MR. ORANGE
                 I'm a cop.

       Mr. White doesn't say anything, he keeps stroking Orange's
       brow.

                              MR. ORANGE
                 I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

       Mr. White lifts his .45 and places the barrel between Mr.
       Orange's eyes.

       The CAMERA MOVES into an EXTREME C.U. of Mr White.

       The SOUNDS of outside STORM inside.  We don't see
       anything, but we HEAR a bunch of shotguns COCKING.

                              POLICE FORCE (OS)
                 Freeze, motherfucker!  Drop your
                 fucking gun!
       
       Mr White looks up at them, smiles, PULLS the trigger.

       BANG

       We hear a BURST of SHOTGUN FIRE.

       Mr. White is BLOWN out of frame, leaving it empty.
ROCKNROLLA

1   INT. DERELICT BUILDING - DAY                                      1

    WE MEET: MUMBLES(late 30s) and ONE TWO (late 30s). They are
    listening to a sales pitch from two REAL ESTATE AGENTS.

    We SEE all the relevant pictures of their pitch explaining a
    changing city, LONDON.

                            SLICK ESTATE AGENT (V.O.)
              Two years ago this property cost one
              million pounds.
                  (we SEE building)
              Today, it costs five million.

    The camera WHIP PANS over to another part of the building to
    see the other ESTATE AGENT giving his pitch. The camera
    will keep this back and forth for the duration of the scene.
                            OTHER SLICK ESTATE AGENT (V.O.)
              How did this happen?
                  (CUT TO relevant
                   pictures as he speaks)
              Attractive tax opportunities for
              foreign investment, restrictive
              building consent and massive hedge
              fund bonuses,...
                  (beat)
              London, my good man, is fast becoming
              the financial and cultural capital
              of the world.

                            SLICK ESTATE AGENT
              And of course the Russians have come
              to town.

                            OTHER SLICK ESTATE AGENT
              Makes it hard to compete with an ex-
              Soviet oligarch that has six billion
              dollars in his back pocket. They
              don't haggle the price, they double
              the price.

                            SLICK ESTATE AGENT
              Russians come, prices rise, and it
              doesn't stop. It only goes one way.

                            OTHER SLICK ESTATE AGENT
              Up.

                            SLICK ESTATE AGENT
              I can't teach you how to skin a cat,
              but I can tell you a lot about the
              money in bricks and mortar.

                 Like he said, it's going one way.
                 You need to see a lawyer.

    One Two and Mumbles look at one another.

                             ONE TWO
              We need to see a Lawyer.

2   INT. LAWYER'S OFFICE                                             2

    CUT TO a modern looking LAWYER'S office.   We SEE the LAWYER
    advising MUMBLES AND ONE TWO.

                             LAWYER TYPE
              They say it's only going one way.

3   EXT. STREET - DAY                                                3

    ONE TWO and the LAWYER are here looking at the building, it
    is a bit dilapidated and bleak.

                             LAWYER TYPE
              It looks like a great deal.

4   INT. LAWYER'S OFFICE                                             4

    We cut back into the office where the LAWYER lays out the

              These are the plans,...it costs ten
              and it'll be worth twenty with
              planning. But first you gotta give
              the councilor a drink.

               He can't get the planing.

     Lenny is looking out to One Two and Mumbles who are standing
     outside his car looking very white. Lenny screams from the
     back seat.

                              LENNY COLE
               What do you mean you can't get the
               fuckin planning?
                   (pointing)
               There is seven million of my cash in
               there, without planning it's worth
               five,...you owe me. I take the
               building, you lose your share, but I
               am still outta pocket two large ones.
               Find it.

     The window goes up and the car pulls off.      Lenny picks up
     his phone, he dials huffing and puffing.

                 Is that you Councilor?
                      (Lenny smiles)

                 Sorted Lenny.

     He puts the phone down and looks over smiling.     MEET ARCHY
     (Lenny's right hand man, 50s).

                             LENNY COLE
                 What's wrong with you Arch?
                             ARCHY
                 That's a bit strong isn't it Len?
                 They come from the same place as
                 you, you'll clean 'em out.

                             LENNY COLE
                 Same place as me? Do I look like an
                 immigrant Archy?

     On each side of him are two ESCORTS(ex-military types, heavy
     looking). As they pass each door, we realize where ever he
     is going, it has to be important. The ESCORTS talk in to
     their microphones and to the different GUARDS on each door
     way.

     Every now and then we see the SPORTS ARENA in the back ground.
     At last we reach the main door to the head office.

14   INT. HEAD OFFICE                                                 14

     As the door is opened we see a small crowd of MEN in suits
     gathered around a kind-looking MAN with bright blue eyes.
     He nods a couple of times.

     We CUT TO the front of Lenny who is clearly impressed, Mr.
     Blue eyes pays him no attention. The small crowd of business
     MEN shake hands and head to the door at which Lenny is waiting
     patiently.

15   INT. SPORTS ARENA -- DAY                                         15

     CLOSE UP on the back of URI (Russian Jew, 40s, slick, and
     well groomed, he is our Mr. Blue Eyes) overlooking his sports
     arena. We stay on the back of Uri's head while he is talking
     to Lenny.

                             URI
               Glad you could join us here Lenny.

                             LENNY COLE
               It's nice to see you Uri.

                             URI
               Good.
                   (there is a pause)
               I can see we are very much alike you
               and I Lenny. We like to get things
               done.
                   (beat)
               What's it going to cost me?

                             LENNY COLE
               First, let me make clear how much we
               can help you benefit from this deal.
               With out me, it will take you five
               to ten years to get the permission
               to erect your arena.
                   (beat)
               Second, with Government policy as it
               so stands we both know it's unlikely
               that you'd ever get that consent.
                   (beat)
               Thirdly, in legal fees, transactions
               and building consent, you'd be paying
               6 to 12 million without any real
               guarantee of that result.

     We CUT TO Uri unfazed, he just wants the figure.

     Still unfazed.

                              URI
               I expect a guarantee that I have
               consent within six months and no red
               tape.

     Pause while tension stews, then,...

16   INT. SPORTS ARENA - PRIVATE BAR                                 16

     Uri walks to the bar. Lenny follows trying to contain his
     excitement, he's out of his league, a "welcome to the
     billionaires club" look has struck him pink. Lenny passes a
     PICTURE that's sat on an EASEL.

                              LENNY COLE
               Oh, that's a nice picture Uri, hasn't
               it got, errrh depth?

     Uri is at the bar now. He has placed one large tumbler down
     and is pouring a very very large measure out.

                              URI
               That picture has brought me nothing
               but luck Lenny,..it's my lucky
               picture.
                   (he has a good idea)
               You like? Take it for a while, maybe
               it will give you luck.

                              LENNY COLE
               Oh I couldn't Uri,...

     Still absorbed with the painting.

                              URI
               Now we're partners, I insist. I
               will get it sent around to your house
               and you can give it back to me when
               our deal is finalized.

     Lenny looks at the bar. Uri motions, there is a SMALL KEG
     of WHISKEY on the bar and only one large glass.

     A man and woman sit on one side of a desk, MEET STELLA AND
     BERTIE. Bertie is 45 and handsome in a dark posh sort of
     way. Stella is 32, film star. Sitting opposite them are
     two TAX MEN(civil servant types, grey, middle aged, a little
     tubby and bald). There's a stand off.

                             STELLA
               Look, can we shut the door?

     There's a pause while the TAX MAN looks at his colleague.

                             TAX MAN
               Shut the door.

     His colleague gets up and shuts the door.

                             STELLA
               Let's put our cards on the table.
               We both know you aren't going to get
               the full forty out of my clients.

                             TAX MAN
               This is the tax office and in the
               end we get what we want.

                  Save that speech for the tourists
                  Charlie and let's strike a deal -
                  take the twenty now and let it go.
                  Otherwise, they'll move the company
                  off shore tomorrow and you'll spend
                  the next twenty years chasing an
                  imaginary forty million around every
                  republic that grows bananas.

     Bertie lifts out papers from his brief case.

                              TAX MAN
                  I see why you married her now Bertie.

     The two TAX MEN look at each other, they're thinking the
     same thought.

                  I told you we'd make a great team,..
                  You know why you get those deals?

     She looks relatively bored.

                              BERTIE (CONT'D)
                  Because those fat, sad, old men like
                  it when you swear at them. They
                  shake like cocktails and sweat like
                  semtex when you raise that posh little
                  voice. You my love are a rare
                  commodity.
                      (beat)
                  Now come on, give your Bertie a smile.

                              STELLA
                  I don't feel like smiling. I am a
                  thirty two year old accountant married
                  to a homosexual lawyer.
                      (beat)

                  that can be quite inconvenient at
                  times.

     The phone rings, Bertie picks it up and answers.

                  but you didn't ask for no dry ice.
                  You asked for two cases of Johnny
                  Walker black label and four ladies
                  of the pole and I got them for you
                  didn't I?

                  you're the manager and I am the
                  rocker. You've got on the managers
                  hat, now pluck something out of it.

                                 MICKEY
                  My hat is deep and full of magic. I
                  got rabbits, handkerchiefs, and ladies
                  of the pole drinking Black Label. I
                  got smoke machines, bubble machines,
                  I even got love marines and still
                  the hat goes deeper, but....there
                  ain't no mother fuckin dry ice.

26   EXT. TENNIS CLUB - DAY                                              26

     On the tennis court we see the COUNCILOR(our man from the
     beginning), who is playing tennis with TERRY THE INSTRUCTOR.
     The Councilor is taking it seriously apart from the
     distraction of JACKIE on the next door court. ARCHY is here
     watching over the game and reading the paper, we see him
     read an article and look a little moved. Lenny comes up
     behind him and starts to read over his shoulder.

                              LENNY COLE
               Johnny Story singer extraordinare,
               fell off a boat, missing, assumed
               dead.

                              ARCHY
               I don't know what to say Lenny.

                              LENNY COLE
               I bet he took a lot of people with
               him in his hot little crack pipe.
                   (beat)
               We will never mention this again,
               all right Arch?

     Archy looks a little shocked.     Lenny carries on like nothing
     has happened.

                              LENNY COLE (CONT'D)
               Now, tell the Councilor to stop fuckin
               about with sticks and balls and send
               him inside.

                Very good councilor, you must of had

                Fancy a cool down and a chat with
                Lenny?

     The Councilor slyly looks over to Jackie, she looks back.
     The Councilor is thinking explicit thoughts.

                             ARCHY (CONT'D)
                Do you know Jackie?

     Nervous, the Councilor knows these thugs aren't shy.

                             COUNCILOR
                No, no, no, Archy, don't say anything.
                             ARCHY
                Don't worry, she's a friend,..and a
                member.
                    (raises his voice)
                Jackie,..fancy a run'a'round with
                the Councilor?

     Pause.   She looks sullen, stroppy and rude all at the same
     time.

                             JACKIE
                Only if he's wicked.

     She turns away to hit a ball, the Councilor's heart skips a
     beat.

                    (excited and shy)
                What does she mean by that?

                I think she likes you boy-o.

     Lenny is at the bar on his own looking at the papers and
     picking at the nuts. In walks the Councilor with Archy, the
     Councilor sits next to Lenny at the bar.

                             LENNY COLE
                They say that times are changing
                Councilor, that this country isn't
                what it used to be, it's the new New
                York, they say. You being a political
                man must know all about that.

                             COUNCILOR
               Errh, I think they are probably right,
               times have changed, but that shouldn't
               affect you Lenny.

                             LENNY COLE
               They say it's all gone "international"
               now, out with the old guard in with
               the new, but I think they're wrong.

               Anyway, where are my manners? Look

               as a pelican,...and I haven't even
               offered you a wet one.

                             COUNCILOR
               A lemonade and orange please.
                             LENNY COLE
               Oh that's nice,..refreshing, that'll
               put you back on top boy.

     Lenny pulls out the plans and a leather pack of cigars.

                             LENNY COLE (CONT'D)
               Here you go, plans and papers.

               I don't mind if I do,...that's a
               nice lighter.

                             LENNY COLE
               Eight grand they wanted for it cheeky
               toads and I paid, you know why?

               Tell me Lenny.

                             LENNY COLE
               'Cos it's all about the details.

     Looking at the plans.

28   EXT. PARK - MORNING                                                 28

     It's the next morning, we SEE One Two running. Mumbles and
     Handsome Bob pull up along side of him in their car. There
     is a moment of pause while they admire One Two running along
     side of them.

               I reckon he's trying to get fit for

               it?

               A straight going, cocky, educated,

29   INT. LENNY'S HOME OFFICE - NIGHT                                29

     Lenny is pacing in a ladies dressing gown with long silk
     socks. He can't sleep, he pours a large one, lights a cigar,
     picks up the phone and dials.

                              LENNY COLE
               Archy? You awake?
                   (beat)
               Never mind, you are now. I had a
               horrible dream that the Councilor
               didn't come through, I don't want
               anything going wrong on this one,

                  She did? I knew he'd like the

                  off it's easel and stuck it above my

     He suddenly stops. His eyes have spotted something scary,
     the office chair disappears from under him, he takes the
     phone, the lamp, and the ash tray with him to the floor.

     Lenny's still pacing, a small gathering of tired looking
     HOOLIGANS are lined up in Lenny's office.

                             BANDY
               Where was it Len?

     Lenny is standing in front of the fire place smoking and
     looking very anxious.

     There is a bald spot above his head where a picture once
     stood, a picture light illuminates an clearly empty space.
     He is horrified by the stupidity of the question.

                               LENNY COLE
                  Let's take a wild stab in the dark
                  shall we Bandy? Archy slap him and
                  then send him to school 'cos I can't
                  take any more of this. You sort it
                  out, get that picture back and bring
                  me a body, I am going to back to
                  bed.

     He stomps off to bed.

                               ARCHY
                  Bandy if you ever ask a stupid
                  question like that again, you see
                  Danny there? He's gonna slap you.

                               BANDY
                  Sorry Arch, it's just,...I was trying
                  to use initiative.

                               ARCHY
                  Danny slap him.

     DANNY slaps him with the back of his left hand.       Archy's not
     happy - it was the wrong hand.

                               ARCHY (CONT'D)
                  With the right Danny,..properly.

     DANNY slaps him again, it's weak.

                               ARCHY (CONT'D)
                  I said properly, with the back of
                  your right hand Danny.

                               DANNY
                  What is this a tennis match Arch?

                               ARCHY
                  Slap him!

     DANNY slaps him again, BANDY takes it good. Archy huffs and
     goes over to slap him proper, SLAP! Bandy's disappeared
     into another dimension.

                               ARCHY (CONT'D)
                  Like that!

               Daniel, do you want a slap as well?
               Now, if the slap doesn't work,..Cut
               'em...or pay 'em, but keep the

31   EXT. BOND WAREHOUSE - BACK LOT - DAY                             31

     Mumbles, Handsome Bob, and One Two are standing here dressed
     as security guards. Handsome Bob is watching over the car
     that is waiting for the TWO ACCOUNTANTS to come out of the
     back door of the warehouse. One Two and Mumbles are to the
     side.

                              MUMBLES
               You ready?

               Yup, load up boys and pay attention.

     One Two see's the door open and makes a move. Two ACCOUNTANTS
     come out of the back door, while in route they click their
     central locking open on the car waiting. One Two is already
     on them as the ACCOUNTANTS go to open their car door.

                              ONE TWO (CONT'D)
               Hello lads.

     He flashes the gun in his belt. The ACCOUNTANTS are too
     shocked to even know what is going on.

                              ONE TWO (CONT'D)
               Put the bags in the car and walk
               away.

     The ACCOUNTANTS see the gun, but still look for a way out.
     Mumbles meets them with another gun.

     The ACCOUNTANTS do as they are told. One Two and Mumbles
     get into the car, calm as you like. One Two, starts the
     engine, but he can't find reverse. There is a crunching
     sound from the car, the accountants stop and look round.
     One Two puts down the window.

                              ONE TWO

     One Two goes through the motions getting ready to hit the
     accountant without actually being able to do it.

     We see Paul who's obviously completely geared out of his

               I must apologize for my assistants

               Now, I do agree it doesn't seem like

     Malcolm pauses before he panics, he can tell something is

               They say there are only two days you
               enjoy a boat, the day you buy it and

                              STELLA
               Well, according to my figures that

               What have I got to cheer up about, I
               am going to be locked up in an eight

               Don't worry,..you wouldn't understand.

     Pause for a concerned thought from One Two.
                             ONE TWO
               I understand anything coming from

     Pause. A little look from One Two like "Oh you're taken the
     piss", then a realization that he isn't. The brakes are
     slammed on and the car comes to a screeching halt. One Two
     is out before you know it, screaming through the windshield.

     WE CUT BACK TO TEN YEARS AGO. Cut to a shot of a 12 year
     old BOY with a cut under his eye singing "Bank Robber" by
     The Clash in to the mirror. He's wearing just his boxer
     shorts and enjoying himself, he's gonna be a rock star.
     From behind WE SEE his bedroom door open, but the music is
     to loud for the boy to have heard the entrance. We SEE Lenny,
     ten years younger entering, we can tell via the body language
     that he is irritated. He pauses then walks up suddenly
     slapping the boy very hard across the side of the face.
     It's enough to knock him out, the boy goes down - shot like
     a bullet out of a barrel. The red hand then slaps the stereo
     off.

                that is why you are on the gear.
                Your gear is your surrogate father.

                              PETE
                Leave off John, what is this shrink
                time?

                              JOHNNY STORY
                Come on Pedro, share. I'm your
                sponsor, Doctor,...your dad if you're
                feeling a bit of regression coming
                on.
                    (beat)
                But first we should have a drink in
                our hands.

59   INT. BAR                                                         59

     Rough old bar, there are a couple of OLD WASTERS staggering
     around in the distance. Johnny and Pete have now got drinks
     in their hands.

                              PETE
                My Dad made me watch Bonanza every
                Sunday after church.

                  all those guns and cowboys.

                             PETE
               You think? It wasn't all bad, he
               sometimes made me laugh too.

                             JOHNNY STORY
               Now we're getting somewhere. Did he
               interfere with you? You know, touch
               you inappropriate like?

                             PETE
               He tickled me if that's what you
               mean.

                             JOHNNY STORY
               Now that's it! That's what I was
               looking for, you see your Dad is a
               monster Pedro, a tickling monster.
                   (singing)
               Pedro's dad's a tickling monster!

     Johnny helps himself to some WASTERS drink at the bar for a
     quick refreshment. Understandably, the WASTER doesn't look
     happy and his three FRIENDS don't look happy either.

                             WASTER
               That's my drink.

     Johnny gives the WASTER and his FRIENDS the masturbation
     signal without even bothering to look at them.

                             PETE
               Fuck you singalong, you're no help
               and stop calling me Pedro.

     The WASTER grabs a bottle from the bar ready to take some
     action. Johnny grabs a pencil from his top pocket, he holds
     it out like it's a knife. It's almost a joke.

                             JOHNNY STORY
               Come on boy, I'll have you and ya
               girlfriends! I'll do the lot of
               yazz.

     The WASTER is lost. Johnny is not physically scary, he's
     only scary because he's quite clearly mad. He looks like
     Robert Deniro in Taxi driver, mad as mars, he catches himself
     in the mirror, he likes what he sees. Ciggy falling out of
     his mouth, he sort of takes the piss out of himself, smiles
     "tough Johnny," the WASTER backs off he doesn't want junkie
     madness.

     Johnny sits back down next to Pete.

                              JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D)
               Did your Dad do anything else to you
               Pete?

               He hit me bad as well the slag.        Hit
               with a chain.

     Pete starts to lift up his shirt.

                              JOHNNY STORY
                    (Johnny stands)
               What are you doing? I'm not going
               to tickle you Pete, I'm not your
               Dad.

     He looks over and see's Pete has got the most horrific scars
     on his back. Johnny notice's them and stops in his tracks.
     Johnny walks back over to Pete and very tenderly touches his
     back, it feels horrible and bobbled.

                              JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D)
                   (soft)
               I find that profoundly offensive
               Pedro. Two's up on a snout to show
               I care.

     He pulls out a ciggy.     Pete takes it.

                              PETE
               I used to think it had something to
               do with Bonanza.

                              JOHNNY STORY
               Your dad was jealous. Cos you dad
               isn't sure he's your dad, cos you
               don't look like him.

                              PETE
               Really?     What do I look like then?

                              JOHNNY STORY

                              PETE
                Really?

     Pause.   Pete looks at Johnny,...Johnny starts to smile.

     One Two turns a little nasty.

                How did you get this number?

                             LENNY COLE
                Well thank you Uri, that's a real
                compliment from a man that obviously
                takes good care of himself.

                             URI
                I suppose you're wondering why you
                are here?

                             LENNY COLE
                I assume you want to check that
                everything is still "kosher" at my
                end.
                     (pause)
                I was a little surprised you didn't
                come through at the appropriate time,
                but I reckon you have your reasons.
     Silence.

                             URI
                I assume everything is still as you
                say,...Kosher?

     Pause. Lenny milks the moment and after a few seconds of
     mock thought, he speaks.

                             LENNY COLE
                Don't you worry Uri, that one's on
                me,...partners and all that, but I
                wouldn't like it to go south again,
                makes things difficult, if you know
                what I mean?

                             URI
                I understand Lenny and I wouldn't
                like things to go wrong either.
                Which brings me conveniently to my
                next point. Ever since the painting,
                my lucky painting, hasn't been hanging
                on my wall, things have not
                been,....so lucky. I know this is a
                rude request because we have not
                concluded our business, but I feel
                as though I need it.

     Long pause while Lenny scrambles for an excuse.

      We see One Two walking through the party, when he runs into
      Handsome.

                               ONE TWO
                   What the fuck are you doing here?

                   Thought I might celebrate a little,
                   do you mind?

                               ONE TWO
                   Yes I do fuckin mind. Now listen

                   little secret all right and it was

      As One Two walks away he runs into Tom again who stands in          
      his way.

      out cold, he catches him standing up and lowers him to the          
      floor. One Two walks off.

67B   INT. PARTY - SOFA                                               67B

      We CUT TO Mumbles on the sofa who is watching One Two, he         
      grimaces. Bertie is next to him.                                  

                              MUMBLES                                   
                And that's why they call him One                        
                Two.                                                    

                              BERTIE                                    
                So you're part of the wild bunch?
                Stella says you're dangerous.

      Mumbles smiles and flicks his cigar ash into Bertie's glass.
      He knows he's a poof and keeps his eyes on him a second too
      long just to get Bertie excited.

                              MUMBLES
                Does she now?

                              BERTIE
                So is your friend part of the wild
                bunch?

      Bertie is talking about Handsome and Mumbles knows it.

                              MUMBLES
                That young man is the greatest gun
                slinger in town.

                              BERTIE
                    (Bertie smiles)
                Then how come I don't know him?
                    (beat)
                I know all about your type.

                              MUMBLES
                How is that then?
                              BERTIE
                I'm a criminal lawyer,..and I know a
                secret about your part of town.

                              MUMBLES
                What secrets that then?

                              BERTIE
                You have an informer in your neck of
                the woods.

                              MUMBLES
                Oh yeah, so what's his name?

                              BERTIE

68    INT. PARTY    - CORRIDOR                                            68

      CUT TO One two who has just run into Stella, there is a man
      holding a tray of drinks next to them.

                                  STELLA
                   Drink?
                                  ONE TWO
                   Large one,...Dance?

                                  STELLA
                   So, you're a dancer?

                                  ONE TWO
                   Am I a dancer? Shall we put the
                   record straight?

      One Two makes room in front of him and starts to dance
      relativity badly. You get the feeling he probably could
      dance, but he just can't be bothered to make an effort.

                                  ONE TWO (CONT'D)
                   You see it's all in the genes.
                       (he slowly turns)
                   My Dad was a dancer and his Dad before
                   that so gradually it's percolated
                   the old DNA. You not joining me?
                                  STELLA
                   Sure, I like to dance.

      She stands up and dances just like him.

                   me?

                   Same as before, but they're not my

                               MUMBLES
                   He's some big wig lawyer who knows
                   about an informer in our part of

                   at a five stretch, I thought you
                   might be interested.

      Handsome gets the picture and heads over to Bertie.       One Two

                   you look like you might have more
                   than one. Why don't you confess?

                   to, anyway, you don't have to tell
                   me anything. If he's an informer

      Johnny walks in and approaches the BARMAN.        He doesn't like
      Johnny.

                                BARMAN
                   What do you want?

                              JOHNNY STORY
                  Now, now no need for that tone bar
                  steward. I am merely on mission to
                  acquire a shot of your finest Scotch
                  and a packet of your,...
                      (pointing to paper's)
                  Cheapest rolling paper.

                              BARMAN
                  Green or red?

                              JOHNNY STORY
                  King size of course - along with a
                  packet of your shiniest coffin nails.

     The BARMAN reaches for a pack of cigarettes.

                              BARMAN
                  Don't make a scene in here boy.

     Johnny puts a large note on the bar.

                              JOHNNY STORY
                  Put the change in the blind box my
                  good man and remember,...

     He leans into the bar and shuts one eye.

                  "In the kingdom of the blind, the
                  one eyed man is king"

     The BARMAN is left with his mouth open. Johnny walks to the
     piano to drink his Scotch. There are a few beer mats on the
     piano, Johnny wipes the mats off with a glide of his hand
     and they fall to the floor. He raises the lid, coughs,
     composes himself, and extends his hands through his sleeves.
     He hits the first note and takes his scotch down in one. A
     few of the old PUNTERS turn around. Johnny starts to play
     the most beautiful classical music with his eyes shut. Pete
     walks in, approaches Johnny and sits with him. He likes it
     when he plays. Johnny doesn't even need to see him to know
     that he's there.

                  You see that pack of Virginia killing
                  sticks at the end of the piano?

     We SEE the pack of cigarette's on the piano.

                              PETE
                  Yeah.

      Pete picks up the pack as Johnny keeps his eyes shut. The
      following story is a montage of pack shots of the cigarette
      box, intercut with Johnny's delicate fingers stroking the
      keys.

                              JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D)
                You will notice that one of your
                personalities is seduced by the
                illusions of grandeur. A "gold"
                packet of "king" size and with a
                "regal" insignia. An attractive
                implication toward glamour and wealth,
                a subtle suggestion that cigarettes
                are indeed your "royal" and loyal
                friends. And that Pete,...is a lie.
                    (beat)
                Your other personality is trying to
                draw your attention to the flip side
                of the discussion. Written in boring,
                bold, black and white is the
                statement, that these neat little
                soldiers of death, are in fact, trying
                to "kill you." And that Pete,...is
                the truth.
                    (beat)
                Beauty is a beguiling call to death
                and I am addicted to the sweet siren
                of its pitch. And that,..is why,..you
                and I love the crack, and that is
                also why I can not,.. give that
                painting back.

      He opens his eyes and looks at Pete, his cigarette has gone
      out.

                              JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D)
                Now, please pass me a light.

                    (in mock awe)
                Oh you are something special Johnny
                Story.

      Johnny smiles and puts him in a head lock, they fall to the
      floor wrestling.

     Johnny pushes the BOUNCERS arm away. The BOUNCER retorts
     with a slap round the cheek. Pete won't stand for that, he
     goes for the BOUNCER in a pathetic junkie way.

                             PETE
               Get off him you slag, he's class.

     The BOUNCER smashes a big bouncer punch right on Pete's nose.
     Pete shoots back past Johnny and lays in the road, the line
     starts clapping.

      Bob jumps out of his truck and runs down to the second getaway
      car waiting. We SEE One Two and Mumbles get out of their
      car and run over to the Range Rover on its side, they are
      carrying an axe and bolt cutters. Inside, CHECHNYAN 2 slowly
      opens his dazed eyes, to SEE an axe chopping through the
      window. TWO CHOPS and the window gives in. One Two leans
      in and grabs the case, but it's chained to CHECHNYAN 2's
      wrist. One Two pulls the arm out of the window and Mumbles
      uses massive bolt cutters to cut the case free.

                              MUMBLES
                There's another case, grab it.

      One Two leans in and grabs the second case from Chechnyan 1.
      As he is about to chop this one loose, he is pulled into the
      car by CHECHNYAN 2.

                The bastard's still kicking.     Mace

      Mumbles quickly moves around to the other window and sprays
      mace everywhere, including into One Two's eyes.

      CHECHNYAN 2 in the mean time has regained some of his strength
      and is still pulling One Two into the car with him. We can
      SEE Bob in the distance now next to their second getaway car
      looking concerned.

                              ONE TWO (CONT'D)
                Shoot him, shoot him, the bastards
                going to eat me!
      Mumbles pulls out a revolver, sticks it in the window and
      fires it into CHECHNYAN 2's leg. This just aggravates the
      CHECHNYAN.

      Bang.

                   Arhhhhhhhhhhh.     That's my fuckin
                   arm!

      One Two manages to head butt CHECHNYAN 2 and goes back to
      reclaiming the case from CHECHNYAN 1. He pulls it out and
      Mumbles cuts the chain. One Two can't see a thing.

                                  MUMBLES
                   Let's go, we've got it.

                                  ONE TWO
                   Give me a hand, you've blinded me!
      Major confusion is setting in. They run back to their car,
      which is still running, Mumbles shoves One Two into the back
      and jumps in the drivers seat.

                                  ONE TWO (CONT'D)
                   Go, go, go, go!!!!!!

      With his window open, Mumbles wheel spins out of the situation
      and turns to check on One Two. From out of nowhere a very
      large CHECHNYAN arm shoots through the window and puts Mumbles
      in a neck lock. The CHECHNYAN 2 is holding on and not letting
      go.

      The car tears across the road and enters a shop window that
      has a mezzanine. The car comes to a halt on a precarious
      ledge, it's dangling with the CHECHNYAN 2 still not letting
      go.

                   Give me the gun.

      One Two can get a clear shot into the CHECHNYAN 2's side.
      He shots him once, CHECHNYAN 2 doesn't move, twice, three
      times, four times, he finally lets go and falls down on the
      floor.

                                  ONE TWO (CONT'D)
                   Shit, what are these two made out
                   of?

      Mumbles is coughing and slowly coming back to life.

               Grab my hand, we're getting out of

                             ONE TWO
               Who's got the cases?

                             MUMBLES
               I've got 'em.

     As they get out of the car, WE SEE CHECHNYAN 1 has now made
     his way down the street. He is punch drunk with mace in his
     eyes, but extracts a machine gun from under his jacket. The
     boys freeze they are fucked, nowhere to go, but CHECHNYAN 1
     is blinking profusely he can't be sure where they are. He
     lets off a magazine into the manikins next to our boys who
     all hit the deck. The magazine runs dry, CHECHNYAN 1 dips
     into his belt to extract a fresh one. Mumbles see's his
     opportunity, he grabs a golf club that is standing next to
     him, runs at CHECHNYAN 1 and takes a massive swipe at his
     head. CHECHNYAN 1 goes down, but he has already put in a
     new magazine. Mumbles is still carrying the cases, One Two
     is attached to his arm.

                             ONE TWO
               Shoot him Mumbles or we won't get
               out of this!

                             MUMBLES
               I can't fuckin shoot him, you do it.

     A baseball smashes into Mumbles face, he goes down, and he's
     out. CHECHNYAN 2 has appeared carrying a metal baseball
     bat. One Two picks up the machine gun.

                             ONE TWO
               Stop or I'll shoot!

     CHECHNYAN 2 will not stop, he just keeps on coming.

                             ONE TWO (CONT'D)
               I mean it, get down,...get down!

     CHECHNYAN 2 keeps coming, One Two doesn't want to do it but
     he has to. He lets off twenty three bullets into the
     CHECHNYAN 2's chest, the CHECHNYAN is knocked back and
     disappears over the mezzanine. One Two is in shock, he has
     never killed a man. He stands there numb.

     PEOPLE gathered, a great "ohhhhhhhh" goes up.

     Beep. Beep. A car slowly makes it way through the crowd.
     It pulls up and the boys pile in, what's left of them. They
     pull away from the sports shop.

     Bob looks in his mirror, he can see a gun being raised, there
     is someone on the trunk.

                              HANDSOME BOB
               Down.

     He slams on the brakes. CHECHNYAN 2 goes flying over the
     roof, but stops himself hitting the road by perforating the
     hood with his massive knife. He proceeds to perforate the
     wind screen with another knife that he extracts and (because
     of laminate) starts to saw through the wind screen. The
     boys are in horror.

                              HANDSOME BOB (CONT'D)
               Abandon ship!

     One Two gets caught in a head lock by CHECHNYAN 2, they
     struggle. Mumbles hits the CHECHNYAN from behind with a car
     Jack and CHECHNYAN 2 goes down again. One Two's eyes have
     just about come back.
                              ONE TWO
               Run!     Run for your lives.

     The crew split in DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. Bob takes the cases
     and plucks some poor bystander out of their car and takes
     off. Mumbles disappears another way. CHECHNYAN 2 is up and
     follows One Two - terminator style, a foot chase begins.
     One Two, split from the group and being pursued, jumps over
     a wall.

     One Two has ended up on a railway track. He turns back, why
     should CHECHNYAN 2 chase him, he hasn't got the money. But
     no, CHECHNYAN 2 is over the fence, bullet proof vest flapping
     in the wind, and coming after him. One Two finds his strength
     this is his world, the world of the runner - he's off down
     the tracks.

     The pair of them are bleeding profusely, they're bashed to a
     pulp, but they have still got a running sprit. The run goes
     on and on. CHECHNYAN 2 has ripped off his jacket, we can
     see his massive scar covered torso dripping in blood and
     sweat, he seems unstoppable. One Two gets confident and
     starts to run backwards egging CHECHNYAN 2 on, CHECHNYAN 2
     is a good runner, but not good enough. Deep hate fills his
     eyes as One Two makes a fool out of him, CHECHNYAN 2 will
     remember this man. One Two is taking complete liberties, he
     almost stops and waits until CHECHNYAN 2 has caught up to
     him and then he tears off, the CHECHNYAN keeps coming.

     One Two see's in the distance a tiny moped approaching from
     a distance, its CHECHNYAN 1 who completely out sizes the
     machine. However, he's moving and it's moving faster than
     One Two. One Two ducks off the tracks and over a wall, the
     moped gets nearer. At least when he gets over the wall, the
     moped won't follow right? One Two's over. He can hear the
     moped on the other side, One Two looks over his shoulder he
     can see the moped being lifted over the wall. "Oh shit."
     This is where One Two's "zone" comes into play. He drifts
     in to a place that he can not be disturbed and he runs and
     runs and runs. Up, down, through and in.

     We see Mumbles has caught up with One Two along side the
     tracks. He is on a motorbike that he has stolen.

                 Don't you want to know what happened?

                               STELLA
                 I know what happened, it's been all
                 over the news, but I didn't
                 realize,...

                               ONE TWO
                 You didn't say anything about guns,..
                 machine guns with war criminals stuck
                 to the trigger.
                               STELLA
                 I am sorry I didn't know, but
                 shouldn't you have taken precautions?

                               ONE TWO
                 I'll leave your bag under the table
                 all right?
                     (pause)
                 But this isn't about the money is
                 it? I saw you there on that last
                 job. At first I thought it was
                 curiosity,..

      CUT BACK TO THE ROBBERY we see Stella in her car that One
      Two had seen, but we didn't.

                               ONE TWO (CONT'D)

                 on. You don't need the money, you
                 liked the rush. Your old man, can't
                 give you the action can he?

                   something they said they wouldn't
                   give permission to build.

                   they'd never build, how did that
                   happen eh? Fuckin termites got
                   together and had a house building

                   can't do it this time.

      Lenny grabs the Councilor by the bollocks and pushes him up

                               MALCOLM
                       (stunned)
                   One moment sir, there's a pitch that
                   comes with this painting,....

      Cookie gets up from the table and walks over.

                               COOKIE
                   I don't want the pitch, I said I'll
                   have it.

                               MALCOLM
                   It's a very rare and expensive
                   painting sir.

      Malcolm's upset, he wanted to give the pitch. Cookie pulls
      out a lot of money too much for Malcolm to say no to.

                               COOKIE
                   Here ya go, have a week in snow.

      Malcolm takes it.

                               MALCOLM
                   Good afternoon gentlemen, it's been
                   a pleasure. I can hardly wait till
                   the next time.

                   I'll have that painting in a couple
                   of days Uri, trust me on that.

      Uri's not sure about that last statement.

                               URI
                   You like it out here Lenny?

                   you Uri? I can't understand it, not

                               URI
                   That's because I have had the course
                   cleared for us Lenny, we are not
                   going to be disturbed.
                               LENNY COLE
                   Oh that's good, I love a clear fair
                   way, that's a bitta me that Uri.
                   Nothing worse than being jogged on
                   by blind tourists swinging a stick
                   on a Sunday.

                               URI
                   What are we going to do Lenny? Every
                   time I am about to make my payment
                   something dishonest happens.
                       (pause)
                   You, wouldn't know anything about
                   that, would you?

      Clearly shifting gears, could he be saying what he thinks.

                               LENNY COLE
                   Excuse me? Are you trying to say
                   something Uri?

                               URI
                   I am not trying Lenny, I am saying
                   something.

      Lenny is not having any of this, after all he's "top dog."

                               LENNY COLE
                   I think you forget who you are
                   speaking to you insolent bastard.

      Victor has extracted a five iron from out of the golf bag
      and has decided to break both of Lenny's legs in ten different
      places. Lenny screams in unimaginable agony, writhing on
      the green. Uri almost ignores the activity.

      One Two comes in and closes the door behind him.

      He looks down on the floor and there is THE PAINTING, we see
      a large note on it that says.

      "Let myself in, thought your lady would like the painting.
      Love, Cookie"

      The door bell rings, he opens it and there stands Stella.
      She walks in straight past One Two, he turns round with his
      mouth open, she gently slaps it shut and kisses him.

      TV, more silly cartoons. He's got his top off and he's
      smoking a ciggy. His feet are resting on an old chair and
      Pete is asleep next to him. Johnny hardly moves.

                              ROMAN
                So why did you call Johnny?

                              JOHNNY STORY
                Sorry, Johnny's not home right now,
                but the pipe is and the pipe says
                that Johnny heard you were getting
                in trouble boys.

      Roman gives a slight roll of the eyes.

                               ROMAN
                   Look, whoever I am talking to please
                   relay the message to Johnny. His
                   Dad, his jack in the box surprise
                   gangster Daddy, paid us a visit.
                   Shut down a few of our venues and he
                   intends to shut down a few more unless
                   Mr Story puts in an appearance.

                               JOHNNY STORY
                   Why are you talking to a pipe Roman?
                   You're madder than I am.

                               MICKEY
                   Come back Johnny, come back home.

                               JOHNNY STORY
                   But home is where your head is and I
                   don't feel at home in my head.
                       (beat)
                   Come back Johnny!

      Johnny smiles and pulls out a gun from under his arse. He
      points it at Roman, waits until he knows they feel it and
      pulls the trigger.

      It's a lighter. He relights his splif, hot hash dropping on
      his chest, he ignores it.

                               JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D)
                   I bet our Lenny gave you the "I'm

                       (impersonating Lenny)
                   I've seen jelly fish with closer DNA
                   than that slag. Now Johnny will
                   come quietly, but you might have a
                   couple of problems with the pipe.
                       (he sighs)
                   Come on boys, buy us both a cup of
                   tea. No need for any noise, let
                   Pete sleep on.

120   INT. ONE TWO'S HOUSE                                              120

      One Two has still got the headphones on, his eyes shut and
      he's tapping his knees. All of a sudden the music stops
      coming out of the headset and is now filling the room, someone
      else is here.

                Uri is a man born with nothing, carved
                his way up the hard way, he's smart,
                young and only one thing will stop
                him from reaching his goals,...women.
                And this woman has become a problem.
                    (pause)
                My job is to protect Uri and in this
                department he needs protecting, I
                don't like her or trust her and I
                want you to follow that snake.

      We reveal it's CHECHNYAN 1 our war criminal who is looking
      battered from the beating the day before.

                                 CHECHNYAN 1
                Leave it with me Victor.

122   EXT. RESTAURANT       - FLASH BACK                              122

      We go back to the scene at the restaurant from a different
      perspective. The two CHECHNYAN'S see One Two and Handsome
      Bob walk out of the restaurant, they two look at one another,
      their brows steel.

123   INT. ONE TWO'S HOUSE                                            123

      CUT BACK to present with the music being cut off from One
      Two's head phones. He opens his eyes, on his throat lies a
      very long and sharp knife. The two CHECHNYANS have entered
      the room and pulled the wire out of the machine. CHECHNYAN
      1 is sitting on a chair next to One Two, he's the one with
      the blade. He smiles, One Two doesn't.

124   EXT. ONE TWO'S HOUSE                                            124

      Archy approaches the door with Danny behind, he pushes it,
      it opens. Concerned, he pulls out a shooter, so does Danny,
      they go in.

125   INT. ONE TWO'S HOUSE                                            125

      The music is very loud, it's Russian. Archy and Danny make
      their way to it's source, up the stairs, to the bedroom door.
      The base thumps out. Archy tries the handle, it turns, he
      pushes the door open slowly. The music becomes clear as we
      reveal a horrible scene. Archy is shocked, but a little
      amused.

      Tied to the bed, back to front with a pillow over his head
      is One Two. A large blade is resting on his back, a bottle
      of vodka is open on the side, One Two cries and wriggles
      uselessly.

      On the floor facing the other direction is our pretty much
      naked Chechnyan doing a traditional Chechnyan dance, which
      involves lots of extended leg action.

      He is wearing military speedos and fuck all else apart from
      his military hat. He is "having much fun." His massive
      frame is still black and blue from the beating One Two
      previously inflicted. The other Chechnyan (similarly
      dressed), is digging into his bag of tools, extracting all
      sorts of horrible looking things. Archy looks on amazed by
      the show, he has a quick look at Danny who is also bemused.
      He hits the "off" button, the Chechnyans spin, looking
      distressed. Silence ensues.

                              ARCHY
                Is this a bad time One Two?

                Emmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.

      The Chechnyans make a quick move, their last ever.        We hear
      FOUR shots ring out quickly.

      Handsome Bob and Mumbles pull up and get out. Handsome Bob
      puts the paper work in his top pocket and bangs on the front
      door.

      One Two is being wrapped up in a carpet on the floor. He's
      still emmmmmmmmming and wriggling. We hear Handsome Bob and
      Mumbles at the front.

129   EXT. ETON POSH SCHOOL - WE FLASHBACK TEN YEARS                  129

      Archy leans against a ROLLSROYCE with another HEAVY. Young
      Johnny walks up, he's wearing tales and a bow tie, he's with
      two of his toffy school FRIENDS.

                               JOHNNY STORY
                Hello Archy.

                Show us your guns Uncle Arch, I told
                the boys all about it.

                               ARCHY
                Shut up and get in the car.

      Archy throws Johnny a packet of rolos and turns to get in
      the car. As he turns, Johnny lifts up the back of his sports
      jacket and steals his gun. The two FRIENDS are in shock,
      needless to say so is Archy. Johnny holds it on his two
      friends.

                               JOHNNY STORY
                Give us your money boys.
      Archy grabs the gun and hits Johnny on the back of the head,
      not too hard.

                You little swine,... now get in the
                car.

      Archy puts the gun away and looks at the two shocked school
      friends. He gently slaps them on the cheek in an intimidating
      way and gives them a tener.

                               ARCHY (CONT'D)

                               JOHNNY STORY
                   You're looking a bit down, has that
                   old clown been working you long hours?
                       (beat)
                   You always were loyal - no dog like
                   a loyal dog.

                               ARCHY
                   Watch your mouth John.

                        (feigning fear)
                   Don't hit me Archy, I'm a singer not
                   a fighter.
                        (back to normal)
                   I've just the remedy for you, a story,
                   a Johnny Story and it's all about
                   you.
      Archy presses a button to call the elevator.       They wait.

                               ARCHY
                   I don't want to hear it.

                               JOHNNY STORY
                   Sorry, that's right get into

                   Look at him boys, scary ain't he?

      Roman and Mickey don't like any of this.

                               JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D)
                   That's what four years inside does
                   to a man, eats his soul and when
                   it's all gone it makes a man quite
                   scary. Ever wondered how you got
                   there? Ever wondered what grass
                   informed on you?

      The elevator arrives and they all pile in, including the
      rugs with One Two, Mumbles and Handsome Bob.

      A noise comes from one of the carpets.

      Archy turns and slaps him the famous "Archy slap" it's nasty,
      Archy's getting wound up.

                              ARCHY
                Shut it, otherwise you will get hurt.

      His face has been slapped into the direction of Roman and
      Mickey. Johnny keeps his head still,...

                              JOHNNY STORY
                That, Roman and Mickey, is the famous
                Archy slap. I have been magically
                transported straight back to my
                childhood.

      He speaks next in a little boys voice, he's taking the piss.

                              JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D)
                Don't turn Archy in, he's your friend,
                he's loyal, just like the dog.

      He changes to impersonate Lenny, its deep and over the top.

                              JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D)
                Shut up boy, don't stick your nose
                where it don't belong otherwise I'll
                chop it off.
                    (little boy voice)
                But you can't do it to Uncle Arch, I
                love him.

                Needs a little lesson though don't
                he? Left his station hasn't he? A
                little time inside to remember who
                the boss is.

      Archy straightens his tie to remain calm, but can't take it
      any longer. He picks Johnny up and slams him against the
      wall.
                              ARCHY
                    (shouting)

      The elevator door opens and we see skinny Johnny stuck up in

                   Put him down Arch, he's only little.

      Archy drops him, his wires crossed.        He needs a little time
      to think.

      Johnny is off out of the elevator walking away happy as a
      clam. Back to Archy in the elevator.

                                DANNY (CONT'D)
                   You all right?     You look a little

      Johnny comes bowling in like a 'rocknrolla' coming on to
      stage. He spots Lenny.

                                JOHNNY STORY
                   Sidney!   Nice wheels.

      Archy comes in with Danny and the carpets, Handsome Bob hears
      this, is Lenny Cole the Sidney Shaw?

                                JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D)
                   Sorry about the painting, needed the
                   cash for a little bit of the old
                   "dusty show bizzzzzzzz."
                       (beat)
                   So, it's gone now, lost in the world
                   of degenerate and stoned no hopers,
                   never to be seen again by the eye of
                   a clean soul.

      There is a pause while Lenny considers just shooting him.
      He changes his tone, he gets serious and slow.

                                LENNY COLE
                   Tell me, what are you boy if you are
                   not poison? Look what you've left
                   behind you. Your Dad couldn't even
                   bear the sight ya, no wonder he fucked
                   off and left me to pick up the pieces,
                   but that wasn't enough for you was
                   it? No, had to drive your mum into
                   a bottle of pills and house full of

                                 ARCHY
                   I've had enough of him, I don't trust

                   Use someone else.

      Johnny grabs the back of Lenny's chair and pushes him around
      like he's a two year old, Lenny feels a right twit. One
      Two, Handsome Bob, and Mumbles observe.

                                 JOHNNY STORY

                   Archy who's ruining the day. I tried
                   to cheer him up with that story about
                   how you grassed him u,...

      BANG! Lenny shoots Johnny in the hip with a gun he has kept
      hidden. Everybody is shocked, Danny jumps back in horror
      that was pretty close.

                                 ROMAN
                   Whooooa,...

                   All right calm down, give me that,
                   I'll take care of him.

      Danny moves in to take the gun from Lenny.    Johnny speaks in
      pain, but still chipper.

                                 JOHNNY STORY
                   That wasn't one of your better shots
                   was it now Daddy. If you want to
                   shut me up it should have been a bit
                   higher.

      Lenny looks up to Danny.

                Here, Archy,...you know I wouldn't

      Lenny is out of reach of them, Archy can tell Handsome Bob
      is implying something.

                Let me have a look first.

      He takes the letters out of Handsome Bob's top pocket and
      opens them up. He squints, the print is too small he can't
      read what it says.

                              ARCHY
                Here you can't read it without your
                glasses, let me have a look.

      Lenny looks uncomfortable, Archy almost snatches the letters
      and flicks through the pages. He reads to himself, could it
      be true? Could Lenny be the informer sending everyone around
      him down?

                In about two minutes from now, when
                we're all driving along happily,...

      WE FLASH FORWARD TO AN IMAGINARY SCENE - JOHNNY'S V.O. IS
      ACTED OUT.

                               JOHNNY STORY (V.O.)
                Danny boy is going to turn around
                and "pop me" two in the head and one
                in throat just to make sure.
                    (beat)
                And then, since Danny is obviously
                going to kill you two as well,...

      WE SEE the imaginary shots from Danny's gun go off on Mickey
      and Roman.

                Funny thing with the law, it can be
                quite flexible. Every time an

      We see Archy's story acted out in the full court room, Law
      and Order style. The judge and lawyer act out Archy's words.

                               JUDGE
                A secret letter stands witness as to
                the cooperation and efficiency of
                that informer.

                An accurate record of his treachery

                A sort of, "get out of jail free"

                trail of a good alibi.

      Archy turns the pages of the letter. WE SEE different JUDGES
      giving different sentences to different FACES, some of these
      faces we know, one of them is Fred the Head, Handsome Bob
      and one of them is ARCHY.

                               LAWYER
                The only evidence that will ever
                remain of this deal is that form of
                a very exclusive and hard to come by
                legal document called a "secret
                debt"...

                Of course they use a false name and
                I have seen that name many times in

                wonder who Sidney Shaw was,...

                   You're a dirty bastard Sidney, a
                   very dirty bastard.

      Archy grabs the belt that's used to tie up drowning victims,
      he throws it round Lenny's chair and stuffs a bit of cloth
      into Lenny's wide open mouth.

                               ARCHY (CONT'D)

                   You three, cut yourself free and get
                   out of here,...

      Archy throws a knife across to Mumbles who just catches it
      and starts to cut his way out of the ropes. Archy gets back
      on with the job at hand. He reads through the names Lenny
      has grassed on over the years.

                               ARCHY (CONT'D)
                   Michael Finny, ten years. Frazier

                   Michael Dexter, eight years.

      Archy grabs the winch that lowers victims to their crayfish
      death and bangs it on to the back of the wheel chair. He
      presses the start button and the wheelchair is raised with
      haste.

                               ARCHY (CONT'D)
                   The Jew twins, fourteen years and of

      We see six gallons of petrol in the trunk of the car in our
      imaginary scene.

                              JOHNNY
                And pour six gallons of petrol on
                top, I can let your imagination fill
                in the rest.

                But now Danny's rattled, he won't be
                able to wait because you now know
                what's coming, so he's gonna fire.

      Danny, who is now in a state because Johnny has predicted
      everything he's going to do, suddenly turns with his gun.
      Mickey catches it, the force of the stop pulls the trigger,
      and the other MANS head is drilled through. Roman joins the
      wrestling match and gets the gun and wrist to aim at Danny's
      head. The trigger gets squeezed and Danny's head also gets
      a drilling. Silence. Johnny, who is smothered in blood,
      speaks coolly.

                              JOHNNY STORY
                Mickey, pass me the gun.

      Mickey is out to lunch, but Johnny sounds commanding.

                MICKEY quickly, pass me that gun in
                Dannys hand. Don't worry he can't
                defend himself he doesn't have a
                head, quickly now. Does this answer
                the question that you two so
                frequently asked as to why I sought
                refuge in the depths and perverse
                beauty of the crack pipe?

      The elevator door opens.

      He looks on in horror and points the gun at Johnny. Just as
      he's about to fire,..there is a great smash of bone on timber.
      Bandy falls to reveal One Two standing there with a large
      piece of timber.

      At which point in the background WE SEE Lenny being lowered
      to his demise. He looks at the group in horror as he is
      quickly lowered to his death by drowning and cray fish.

      Uri turns. There, casually resting on the floor is his

                   A very nice painting. How long have
                   you had it?

      A little caught off guard.

                               STELLA
                   Years, it's my lucky painting,...
                   it's very special isn't it?

      Pause, she smiles. Uri talks back into the phone, the other

          EXT. HIGHWAY. AFTERNOON.


          
          A ribbon of freeway stretching into a blue and pink late
          afternoon sky. A huge dark sedan, windows tinted gold,
          headlights blazing, powers directly for us.

          
          CUT TO: A heavy, low-slung, pickup truck traveling toward
          the sedan.

          
          WIDE SHOT: Sky, freeway, the cars closing.

          
          TIGHT ON: The sedan.

          
          TIGHT ON: The pickup.

          
          Like thunderous, jousting opponents, the cars pass in a
          deafening cacophony of noise.

          

          INT. TRUCK. AFTERNOON.


          
          TIGHT ON: The fat face of GREGORY, yelling at the
          disappearing sedan.

          

           GREGORY
           A dog of the house of Capulet moves
           me!

          
          He and the pimply-faced front-seat passenger, SAMPSON,
          explode with laughter.

          
          The red-haired driver BENVOLIO, keeps his eyes on the road.

          

          EXT. EXIT RAMP. AFTERNOON.


          
          The truck spirals down an exit ramp and screeches into busy
          driveway of a large gas station.

          

          EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON.


          
          Attendants immediately run to the truck. Two clean
          windshields and duco, the third fills the gas tank.

          

          INT. TRUCK. AFTERNOON.


          
          Gregory in the back seat is boasting outrageously.

          

           GREGORY
           A dog of that house shall move me
           to stand. I will take the wall of
           any man or maid of Capulets.

          
          Sampson, sarcastically.

          

           SAMPSON
           That shows thee a weak slave. For
           the weakest goes to the wall.

          

           GREGORY
           'Tis true; and therefore women,
           being the weaker vessels, are ever
           thrust to the wall. Therefore, I
           will push Capulet's men from the
           wall, and thrust his maids to the
           wall.

          
          Benvolio, disgusted, gets out of the car.

          

           BENVOLIO
           The quarrel is between our masters...

          

           GREGORY
           (yelling after him)
           ...and us their men.

          

          EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON.


          
          FOLLOW: Benvolio as he heads for the bathroom.

          
          PICK UP: A mother wrangling three little boys out of a
          station wagon - the smallest kid carries a toy pistol.

          
          SUPER FAST SCAN TRACK: Past the mother to - the huge black
          sedan pulling up outside the gas station mini-mart.

          
          The front door of the sedan opens. Shiny black boots -
          decorated with tiny, silver, cat-shaped spurs - plant
          themselves on the ground. The boots are joined by two other
          pairs of well-shod feet.

          
          HOLD: The spurred boots move out of frame.

          
          CRANE UP: The other feet belong to a tough-looking Latin
          youth ABRA - and his goateed side-kick PETRUCHIO.

          
          Abra and Petruchio enter the mini-mart, as four white-clad
          girls exit.

          
          FOLLOW: The girls as they head for their car.

          
          SUPER FAST SCAN TRACK: Past the girls to:

          

          INT. TRUCK. AFTERNOON.


          
          Sampson is trying to out boast Gregory.

          

           SAMPSON
           I will show myself a tyrant. When
           I have fought with the men I will
           be civil with the maids, I will cut
           off their heads.

          
          Gregory; mock outrage.

          

           GREGORY
           The heads of the maids?

          
          Sampson leers lecherously at the girls.

          

           SAMPSON
           Ay, the heads of the maids, or
           their maiden heads, take it in what
           sense thou wilt.

          

           GREGORY
           They must take it in sense that
           feel it.

          
          Gregory and Sampson pump up the song on the sound system and
          sing out at the girls.

          

           GREGORY/SAMPSON

           (SINGING)
           I am a pretty piece of flesh!
           I am a pretty piece of flesh!
           Me, they shall feel while I am able
           to stand;
           I am a pretty piece of flesh!

          
          The girls, pretending not to notice, get into the car.

          

          EXT. GAS STATION - MINIMART. AFTERNOON.


          
          GREGORY'S P.O.V.: The car pulls away revealing... Abra and
          Petruchio exiting the mini-mart.

          

          INT. TRUCK. AFTERNOON.


          
          CLOSE ON: Gregory.

          
          CLOSE ON: Sampson - Their singing abruptly halts.

          

           SAMPSON
           Here comes of the House of Capulet.

          

          EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON.


          
          Abra and Petruchio stare coldly toward the boys.

          

          INT. TRUCK. AFTERNOON.


          
          CLOSE ON: Sampson swallowing hard.

          
          CLOSE ON: Gregory; eyes locked to the Capulets. With fake
          bravado he nudges Sampson.

          

           GREGORY
           Quarrel I will back thee.

          
          CLOSE ON: Sampson trying to quell his rising panic.

          

           SAMPSON
           Let us take the law of our sides.
           Let them begin.

          
          SUDDENLY: BANG! Gregory and Sampson jump.

          
          WHIP PAN: It was the garage attendant slamming the hood.

          
          Gregory and Sampson are mortally embarrassed.

          

          EXT. MINI-MART. AFTERNOON.


          
          Abra and Petruchio laugh contemptuously and move to their

          CAR:

          
          FOLLOW: The mother and kids exiting the mini-mart.

          
          SUPER FAST SCAN TRACK: To...

          

          INT. TRUCK. AFTERNOON.


          
          Sampson furiously tries to save face.

          

           SAMPSON
           I will bite my thumb at them; which
           is a disgrace to them if they bear
           it.

          
          Sampson quickly bites his thumb toward Abra's back as he
          gets into the sedan.

          

          INT. SEDAN. AFTERNOON.


          
          Abra's eyes flick to the rear view mirror.

          
          E.C.U.: The rear view mirror; Sampson biting his thumb.

          

          EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON.


          
          Suddenly, a blood curdling screech of tires - the sedan,
          rubber burning, reverses full speed toward Sampson and
          Gregory.

          
          The mother in the station wagon brakes to avoid collision -
          a sports car shunts into her vehicle. Mother and children
          scream.

          
          Attendants scatter.

          
          The Capulet car shudders to a halt inches from the truck,
          blocking its path.

          

          INT. BLACK SEDAN. AFTERNOON.


          
          CLOSE ON: A scurry of limbs scrabbling across seats and
          reaching for door handles;

          

          EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON.


          
          Abra hauls Sampson from the truck. Gregory leaps out,
          Petruchio covers him. Abra slams Sampson against the side of
          the vehicle - then, goading him to go for his gun, screams:

          

           ABRA
           Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

          
          Sampson's shaking hand hovers - ready to draw.

          

           SAMPSON
           I do bite my thumb, sir.

          

          INT. STATION WAGON. AFTERNOON.


          
          CUT TO: The panicked mother in the station wagon. She
          motions her children to the floor.

          

          EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON.


          
          Customers run for cover.

          
          CLOSE ON: Abra: An hysterical rage; he shrieks:

          

           ABRA
           Do you bite you thumb at us, sir?

          

           SAMPSON
           (sweating, murmurs to Gregory)
           Is the law on our side if I say "Ay"?

          

           GREGORY
           No.

          

          INT. BATHROOM. AFTERNOON.


          
          CLOSE ON: The black cowboy boots, trousers down around them.
          The sound of a toilet flushing.

          
          PAN TO: The next cubicle, the door opens revealing Benvolio.

          

          EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON.


          
          CLOSE ON: Sampson, still sweating.

          

           SAMPSON
           No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at
           you, sir - but I do bite my thumb,
           sir!

          
          CUT TO: Gregory; a ridiculous inquiry.

          

           GREGORY
           Do you quarrel, sir?

          
          CUT TO: Abra; a dangerous smile.

          

           ABRA
           Quarrel sir, no sir.

          
          CLOSE ON: Sampson; unconvincing bravado...

          

           SAMPSON
           But if you do, sir, I am for you. I
           serve as good a man as you.

          
          CLOSE ON: Abra; a lethal question.

          

           ABRA
           No better?

          
          CLOSE ON: Sampson, trapped.

          

           SAMPSON
           Well sir...

          

          INT. STATION WAGON. AFTERNOON.


          
          CUT TO: Inside the station wagon. The mother does not
          notice her five year old aiming a toy gun toward the boys.

          

          EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON.


          
          CUT TO: Gregory's P.O.V.: Benvolio emerging from the
          bathroom - he whispers maniacally.

          

           GREGORY
           Here comes our kinsman. Say better!

          
          EXTREME CLOSE UP: Sampson; he screams:

          

           SAMPSON

           YES SIR, BETTER!

          
          EXTREME CLOSE UP: Abra demonically roars:

          

           ABRA

           THOU LIEST!

          
          CUT TO: Benvolio. Terror stricken, he sees the boys.

          
          DISTORTED OUT OF CONTROL CLOSE UP: Abra shrieks:

          

           ABRA

           DRAW IF YOU BE MEN!

          
          LIGHTNING CUT: Four hands reaching for guns.

          
          SLAM ZOOM: To Benvolio - weapon outstretched he screams:

          

           BENVOLIO
           Part, fools! You know not what you
           do!

          
          MUSIC STING; A SUPER MARCO SLAM ZOOM along the barrel of
          Benvolio's gun; the engraved gun type reads:

          
          'Sword 9mm series S'

          
          CUT TO: Benvolio. He screams in desperation:

          

           BENVOLIO
           Put up your swords!

          
          Gregory, Sampson, Abra, and Petruchio freeze. A moment -
          then from behind, the unmistakable sound of a gun being
          cocked.

          
          EXTREME CLOSE UP: The black cowboy boots.

          
          CRANE UP: To find the dark cold eyes and feline smile, of
          the wearer of the boots. His name is TYBALT; a cigarette is
          clenched between his teeth and his gun is aimed at Benvolio's
          head.

          

           TYBALT
           What, art thou drawn amoung these
           heartless hinds?
           Turn thee Benvolio.

          
          Benvolio, a choked explanation:

          

           BENVOLIO
           I do but keep the peace.

          
          A mocking smile.

          

           TYBALT
           Peace? I hate the word
           As I hate hell, all Montagues, and...

          
          EXTREME CLOSE UP: Tybalt's finger squeezing the trigger...

          
          Suddenly we hear firing from Tybalt's blind side.

          
          Tybalt redirects his weapon, cracking off a single shot at
          the surprise attacker.

          

          EXT./INT. MINIMART. AFTERNOON.


          
          It is the five year old from the station wagon. The bullet
          smacks the toy gun from the child's hand, shattering the
          wagon's window.

          
          Mother and children scream.

          

          EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON.


          
          A panicked Benvolio falls back, accidentally his gun fires -
          the bullet whistles past Tybalt's head.

          
          Tybalt combat rolls, and using a screaming car load of girls
          as cover, returns two quick shots, narrowly missing Benvolio.

          

          EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON.


          
          The gas station attendant hits a button and heavy metal
          screens slam down.

          

          EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON.


          
          CUT TO: Gregory firing - a bullet rips through Abra's arm.

          
          Petruchio dives for cover; Gregory and Sampson leap into
          Benvolio's truck. Rubber burns as they smash past the
          Capulet vehicle.

          
          CLOSE ON: Tybalt taking aim.

          

          EXT. HIGHWAY - SUPERMARKET. AFTERNOON.


          
          His first shot plugs the fuel tank, the second a tire. Out
          of control and spewing gasoline the Montague truck careens
          across the highway and through the glass front of a
          supermarket.

          
          Gregory and Sampson throw themselves from the truck moments
          before...

          

          EXT. SUPERMARKET. AFTERNOON.


          
          CLOSE ON: The gas tank erupts into an almighty fireball.

          
          The screen fills with flame: the following images combust in
          front of us:

          

          EXT. HIGHWAY - SUPERMARKET - FROM AIR. AFTERNOON.


          
          NEWS CHOPPER P.O.V.: Citizens run in the streets.

          
          Looters raid shops near the supermarket - security guards
          return fire.

          

          INT. RESTAURANT. NIGHT.


          
          A table of dark suited men and their wives.

          
          CLOSE ON: The powerful 60 year old face of FULGENCIO CAPULET.
          Seated next to him is his much younger wife GLORIA.

          
          SUDDENLY: Windows explode in a tidal wave of glass. Diners
          take cover.

          
          Capulet moves fearlessly toward the window.

          

           CAPULET
           (to a waiter)
           Give me my long sword!

          

          EXT. STREET. NIGHT.


          
          CLOSE ON: The word MONTAGUE fills the screen.

          
          PULL BACK: We see the word is the number plate of a large
          black limousine.

          
          The limousine is stuck in the traffic snarl - bullets bounce
          off its bullet proof windshield.

          

          INT. MONTAGUE'S LIMOUSINE. NIGHT.


          
          TED MONTAGUE, a 60 year old red-faced bulldog of a man,
          bursts from the back of the limousine.

          

           MONTAGUE
           What noise is this!

          
          As Ted draws an enormous pearl handed revolver, CAROLINE,
          his conservatively dressed wife, tries to restrain him.

          

           CAROLINE
           Thou shalt not stir one foot to
           seek a foe!

          

           MONTAGUE
           (shrugging her off)
           Hold me not, let me go!

          

          EXT. STREET. NIGHT.


          
          Crouched behind a truck, Benvolio shakily tries to re-load.

          
          CLOSE ON: The barrel of Tybalt's gun enters frame and
          presses into Benvolio's forehead. Tybalt whispers sweetly.

          

           TYBALT
           Look upon thy death, Benvolio.

          
          CLOSE ON: Tybalt's finger on the trigger. Benvolio screams
          a scream of mortal horror.

          
          SUDDENLY Tybalt is blinded by a burning shaft of light. A
          magnificently powerful helicopter gunship hovers above him.
          A command booms from the chopper's public address system.

          

           CAPTAIN PRINCE
           (over PA)
           Rebellious subjects, enemies to
           peace,
           Throw your mistempered weapons to
           the ground.

          

          INT. CHOPPER. NIGHT.


          
          CLOSE ON: The steely gray eyes of CAPTAIN PRINCE, chief of
          the Verona Beach Police Department. He lifts the microphone
          and repeats the command.

          

           CAPTAIN PRINCE
           Throw your mistempered weapons to
           the ground!

          

          EXT. VERONA BEACH. NIGHT.


          
          Tybalt looks up to the chopper. Patrol cars screech to a
          halt.

          
          An almighty orchestral chord.

          

          EXT. VERONA BEACH - MATTE SHOT. NIGHT.


          
          SUPER WIDE SHOT: A trail of devastation winds up through
          grid-locked traffic to the burning supermarket.

          
          In the distance looms an enormous statue of Christ flanked
          by two glass towers. We push toward the towers. One is
          neon-crowned MONTAGUE, the other, CAPULET.

          
          We hear:

          

           VOICE OVER
           Two households, both alike in
           dignity.
           In fair Verona, where we lay our

           SCENE
           From ancient grudge break to new
           mutiny,
           Where civil blood makes civil hands
           unclean.
           From forth the fatal loins of these
           two foes
           A pair of star crossed lovers take
           their life.
           Whose misadventured piteous

           OVERTHROWS
           Doth with their death bury their
           parents strife.

          
          A dark chord.

          

          EXT. VERONA BEACH SKYLINE. NIGHT.


          
          A swarm of helicopters thunder into frame. We see
          compressed, time-lapsed, images of their journey.

          
          SLAM INTO: A coat of arms that labels a large tower - the
          emblem reads; "Verona Beach Police Department: In God We
          Trust".

          

          HOLD:

          

          INT. CAPTAIN PRINCE'S PRECINCT OFFICE. NIGHT.


          
          CLOSE ON: Captain Prince's grim features. He eyes Capulet
          and Montague.

          

           CAPTAIN PRINCE
           Three civil brawls, bred of an airy 

           WORD
           By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
           Have thrice disturbed the quiet of
           our streets.

          
          Capulet's lawyer tries to intervene.

          

           LAWYER
           My noble Prince I can...

          
          Captain Prince overriding, slams the desk.

          

           CAPTAIN PRINCE
           If ever you disturb our streets
           again,
           Your lives shall pay the forfeit of
           the peace.

          
          Hold on Captain Prince's determined gaze.

          

          EXT. VERONA STREET. DAWN.


          
          A majestic sunrise; Ted Montague's limousine sulks through
          deserted streets. In the distance, Jesus looks out over the
          now peaceful city.

          

          INT. MONTAGUE'S LIMOUSINE. DAWN.


          
          Ted Montague, his wife Caroline, and nephew Benvolio ride in
          uncomfortable silence.

          
          Caroline finally speaks her anger.

          

           CAROLINE
           O where is Romeo? Saw you him
           today?
           (pointedly to Montague)
           Right glad I am he was not at this
           fray.

          
          Montague snorts derisively and stares out the window.
          Embarrassed, Benvolio tries to be of assistance.

          

           BENVOLIO
           Madam, underneath The Grove of

           SYCAMORE
           So early walking did I see your son.

          
          Ted Montague speaks with contempt.

          

           MONTAGUE
           Many a morning hath he there been

           SEEN
           With tears augmenting the fresh
           morning's dew.

          
          Caroline struggles to contain her emotion.

          

           CAROLINE
           Away from light steals home my
           heavy son
           And private in his chamber pens
           himself,
           Shuts up his windows, locks fair
           daylight out
           And makes himself an artificial
           night.

          
          Montague barks into the car intercom.

          

           MONTAGUE
           Westward from this city side.

          

          EXT. STREET. DAWN.


          
          The limousine U-turns heading west.

          

          EXT. BEACH. DAWN.


          
          To the melancholic strains of Mozart's "Serenade for Winds",
          we see a blond nineteen year old boy sitting alone on an
          empty beach.

          
          CLOSE ON: The boy, ROMEO. Looking out over the ocean he
          sucks on the last of a cigarette and then writes intensely
          in a small worn note book.

          
          We hear his voice over.

          

           ROMEO (V/O)
           Love is a smoke made with the fume
           of sighs;
           Being purged, a fire sparkling in
           lovers' eyes;
           Being vexed, a sea nourished with
           lovers' tears.
           What is it else? A madness most
           discreet,
           A choking gall and a preserving
           sweet.

          

          INT. MONTAGUE'S LIMOUSINE. DAWN.


          
          The limo is parked in a cross street that runs down to the
          beach.

          
          Opposite the limo, young diehard clubbers, faded drag queens
          and street people, hang outside a dilapidated nightclub. A
          broken neon sign reads: "The Grove of Sick Amore."

          
          Ted, Caroline and Benvolio sit watching the silhouette of
          Romeo on the beach.

          

           MONTAGUE
           Black and portentous must this
           humour prove
           Unless good counsel may the cause
           remove.

          

          EXT. BEACH. DAWN.


          
          P.O.V.: From the limousine. Romeo rises and listlessly
          makes his way up the beach - seeing his father's car he
          turns and heads for the path that hugs the beach front.

          

          INT. MONTAGUE'S LIMOUSINE. DAWN.


          

           BENVOLIO
           So please you step aside.
           I'll know his grievance or be much
           denied.

          
          Benvolio clambers out of the limo.

          
          CLOSE ON: Montague, an encouraging smile.

          

           MONTAGUE
           Come Madam. Let's away.

          

          EXT. STREET. DAWN.


          
          The limousine pulls away and Benvolio heads after Romeo. He
          pauses. A deck at the rear of "Sick Amore" sprawls onto the
          beach. At the base of the deck, Benvolio can see Romeo
          squatting in discussion with an old drunk. Benvolio
          approaches with a not very convincing casualness.

          

           BENVOLIO
           Good morrow, cousin.

          
          Romeo turns. Sore, red, unfriendly eyes squint back at
          Benvolio.

          

           ROMEO
           Is the day so young?

          

           BENVOLIO
           But new struck, Coz.

          
          Romeo rises, Benvolio follows.

          

           ROMEO
           Ay me! Sad hours seem long.

          
          Romeo stops as if taking in Benvolio for the first time.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           Was that my father that went hence
           so fast?

          

           BENVOLIO

           (GUILTY)
           It was.

          
          Benvolio chases Romeo down the path which divides the beach
          from a string of cheap souvenir shops and sleazy bars.

          

           BENVOLIO
           What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

          

           ROMEO
           Not having that which having makes
           them short.

          

           BENVOLIO
           In love?

          

           ROMEO
           Out.

          

           BENVOLIO
           Of love?

          

           ROMEO
           Out of her favor where I am in love.

          

           BENVOLIO
           Alas that love, so gentle in his
           view,
           Should be so tyrannical and rough
           in proof!

          

           ROMEO
           Alas that love, whose view...

          
          Romeo is halted by the sight of last night's disturbance
          displayed on a small TV screen in an outdoor bar.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           What fray was here?

          
          Benvolio starts to reply.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)

           (ANGRILY)
           Yet tell me not, for I have heard
           it all.
           Here's much to do with hate, but
           more with love.

          
          Romeo turns the corner away from the beach. He strides
          along the sidewalk raging.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           Why then, O brawling love, O loving
           hate,
           O anything, of nothing first
           create!
           O heavy lightness, serious vanity,
           Misshapen chaos of well-seeming
           forms,
           Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold
           fire, sick health,
           Still-waking sleep, that is not
           what it is!

          
          Romeo screams at a huge bouncer who lounges in the doorway
          of a sex club.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           This love feel I, that feel no love
           in this!

          
          The bouncer's hand moves to his gun. Romeo, ignoring him,
          turns on Benvolio. A mocking laughter through tears:

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           Dost thou not laugh?

          
          Benvolio, nervously eyeing the bouncer, shepherds Romeo out
          of danger.

          

           BENVOLIO
           No, coz, I rather weep.

          
          Romeo smiles.

          

           ROMEO
           Farewell, my coz.

          
          Romeo, breaking into a jog, leaves Benvolio behind. Benvolio
          pursues him down the street.

          

          EXT. ROMEO'S CAR. DAY.


          
          CLOSE ON: The sleeping face of a fourteen year old boy -

          BALTHASAR.

          
          PULL BACK: Balthasar sleeps on the hood of a magnificent
          silver car.

          
          Three or four kids doze on the sidewalk. As Romeo
          approaches, they jump up and begin vigorously polishing the
          already gleaming car.

          
          Balthasar wakes. He springs off the hood, chases the kids
          away, then, producing a huge bunch of keys, opens the car
          door for Romeo.

          
          Benvolio intercepts Romeo at the car.

          

           BENVOLIO
           Tell me in sadness, who is it that
           you love.

          

           ROMEO
           In sadness, cousin, I do love...a
           woman.

          

           BENVOLIO
           I aimed so near when I supposed you
           loved.

          
          Romeo leans against the car.

          

           ROMEO
           A right good marksman; and she's
           fair I love.

          
          Romeo pulls his shirt down to reveal a small shoulder tattoo.

          
          CLOSE ON: The tattooed word; ROSALINE.

          

           BENVOLIO
           Rosaline!
           (he is impressed)
           A right fair mark, fair coz, is
           soonest hit.

          

           ROMEO
           She'll not be hit with Cupid's
           arrow.
           She hath Dian's wit,
           And in strong proof of chastity
           lives well armed.

          
          Benvolio can't believe it.

          

           BENVOLIO
           Then she hath sworn that she will
           still live chaste?

          

           ROMEO
           She hath; and in that sparing makes
           huge waste.

          
          Benvolio - a plan.

           BENVOLIO
           Be ruled by me; forget to think of
           her.

          

           ROMEO
           O, teach me how I should forget to
           think!

          
          Benvolio indicates one of the working girls already strutting
          the foot path.

          

           BENVOLIO
           By giving liberty unto thine eyes.
           Examine other beauties.

          
          Romeo laughs dismissively. He throws the kids a few coins
          and slides into the drivers seat. Balthasar jumps in back.

          

           ROMEO
           Farewell. Thou canst not teach me
           to forget.

          

           BENVOLIO
           I'll pay that doctrine, or else die
           in debt.

          
          Benvolio leaps into the passenger seat of the moving vehicle.

          

          INT. CAPULET OFFICE. DAY.


          
          An orchestral fanfare. TRACK DOWN: Past monstrous letters
          that read CAPULET and in through a window to discover
          Fulgencio Capulet. He stares out the window toward the
          other tallest building in Verona; the one crested with the
          word MONTAGUE.

          

           CAPULET
           But Montague is bound as well as I,
           In penalty alike;

          
          Capulet turns: on the other side of his desk sits DAVID
          PARIS; a square-jawed young man in a red cashmere sweater.
          Tea has been served from an exquisite silver tea service.

          

           CAPULET (CONT.)
           And 'tis not hard, I think, for me
           so old as we to keep the peace.

          
          Dave smiles obligingly.

          

           DAVE
           Of honorable reckoning are you
           both,
           And pity 'tis you lived at odds so
           long.

          
          An awkward pause: Dave sips tea, then, with a deep breath...

          

           DAVE (CONT.)
           But now, my lord, what say you to
           my suit?

          
          Capulet considers the framed photograph on his desk.

          

           CAPULET
           But saying o'er what I have said

           BEFORE;
           My child is yet a stranger in the

           WORLD;
           Let two more summers wither in
           their pride,
           Ere we may think her ripe to be a
           bride.

          
          Dave is politely insistent.

          

           DAVE
           Younger than she are happy mothers
           made.

          

           CAPULET
           (checking him hard)
           And too soon marred are those so
           early made.
           Earth hath swallowed all my hopes
           but she;
           She is the hopeful lady of my earth.

          
          Capulet rounds the desk and places a fatherly hand on Dave's
          shoulder.

          

           CAPULET (CONT.)
           But woo her, gentle Paris, get her
           heart.
           My will to her consent is but a
           part,
           And she agreed, within her scope of

           CHOICE
           Lies my consent and fair according
           voice.
           This night I hold an old Accustomed
           feast.

          
          Capulet leans close.

          

           CAPULET (CONT.)
           At my poor house, look to behold
           this night,
           Fresh female buds that make dark
           heaven light.
           Hear all; all see,
           And like her most whose merit most
           shall be.

          
          Capulet smiles knowingly. Dave seems encouraged.

          

           CAPULET (CONT.)
           (a hearty slap)
           Come go with me!

          
          Capulet excitedly ushers Dave from the office.

          

          INT. POOL HALL. DAY.


          
          Dim, smoke filled. Benvolio and Romeo play pool.

          

           BENVOLIO
           (chalking his cue)
           Take thou some new infection to thy
           eye.

          
          He lines up the six ball top pocket.

          

           BENVOLIO (CONT.)
           And the rank poison of the old will
           die.

          
          A hopeless shot that slams the eight ball toward the side
          pocket. Romeo stops it with his hand and hurls it against
          the other balls.

          

           BENVOLIO
           Why, Romeo, art thou mad?

          
          Romeo sinks the other balls with his hands.

          

           ROMEO
           Not mad, but bound more than a
           madman is;
           Shut up in prison, kept without my
           food,

          
          Romeo stalks away from the table.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           Whipped and tormented.

          
          He stops at the gun check, rummaging in his pocket.

          

           ROMEO
           Good day, good fellow.

          
          A crusty old man looks up from the small television. His
          entire face a tattooed shooting target, the bullseye between
          his eyes.

          
          The old man points to the sign that reads: "No ticket no
          gun." Romeo finally produces a ticket. Crusty the Target
          goes out back. Romeo's attention is caught by the television.

          

          INT. T.V. STUDIO SET. DAY


          

          CUT TO: TELEVISION.

          
          An ostentatious woman and her over groomed partner Rich,
          hosts what looks to be a kind of Entertainment Tonight show.
          The graphic behind them reads "Solemnity Nights" with Susan
          Santandiago and Rich Ranchidis.

          
          Susan speaks conspiratorially to camera.

          

           SUSAN
           Now I'll tell you without asking.
           The great
           Rich Capulet, holds an old
           accustomed feast;

          
          Rich chimes in:

          

           RICH
           A fair Assembly.

          

           SUSAN
           I Pray you sir can you read?

          
          A list of names begins to scroll across the screen. Rich
          reads them off.

          

           RICH
           Signor Placentio and his wife and
           daughters,
           Signor Martino, the Lady Widow
           Of Utruvio and her lovely nieces,
           Rosaline and Livia...

          

          INT. POOL HALL. DAY.


          
          CUT TO: Benvolio, he leans into Romeo.

          

           BENVOLIO
           At this same ancient feast of

           CAPULET'S
           Sups the fair Rosaline; whom thou
           so loves,
           With all the admired beauties of
           Verona.
           Go thither, and with unattained eye
           Compare her face with some that I
           shall show,
           And I will make thee think thy swan
           a crow.

          

           ROMEO
           One fairer than my love?

          
          Crusty returns. He hands the boys their guns.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           The all-seeing sun Ne'er saw her
           match since first the world begun.

          

          CUT TO: TELEVISION.

          

           SUSAN
           If you be not of the house of
           Montagues,
           Come and crush a cup of wine!

          

           RICH
           Rest you merry!

          
          CUT TO: Romeo, he considers.

          

           ROMEO
           I'll go along, no such sight to be
           shown.
           But to rejoice in splendour of mine
           own.

          
          The boys move off.

          

          PUSH IN ON: THE TELEVISION.

          

          EXT. CAPULET STATE. DAY.


          
          An aerial shot of a magnificent island estate. An Italianate
          wonder of Florentine architecture. Armed guards patrol the
          grounds. The telecaption reads "Capulet Mansion."

          
          The file tape loses its television quality. We sweep down
          through manicured gardens, where workers prepare decorations
          for tonight's celebrations, and into the house. The music
          darkens and we hear the desperate calling of a girl's name.

          

           VOICE OVER

           J U L I E T !

          

          INT. CAPULET MANSION - CORRIDOR. DAY.


          
          CUT TO: A long deserted corridor.

          

           VOICE OVER

           J U L I E T !

          

          INT. CAPULET MANSION - DRAWING ROOM. DAY.


          
          CUT TO: An echoey Chinoiserie style drawing room.

          

           VOICE OVER

           J U L I E T !

          

          INT. BATHROOM. DAY.


          
          CLOSE ON: The still, serene, submerged features of a
          beautiful young girl. Dark floating hair gently frames the
          face. Heavy liquid eyes stare up through the water.

          
          We hear, though faintly, the calling:

          

           VOICE OVER

           J U L I E T !

          
          With a rush JULIET surfaces. As she gulps air, we realise
          that she is in fact, in a bath.

          
          We hear the calling loudly again.

          

           VOICE OVER

           J U L I E T !

          
          Juliet listens. For a moment she is very still, then she
          closes her eyes and slides back beneath the surface of the
          water.

          

          INT. ENTRANCE HALL CAPULET MANSION. DAY.


          
          A Gothic, unfriendly environment heavy with religious
          iconography. The entrance hall is crowded with workers and
          servants preparing for tonight's party.

          
          Gloria Capulet fiddles with a short black wig in the hallway
          mirror. She is attired in full Cleopatra costume.

          
          Dissatisfied with the wig, she rips it from her head and
          calls maniacally.

          

           GLORIA

           J U L I E T !

          
          Gloria is met by the NURSE, a fat, grandmotherly Hispanic
          woman.

          

           GLORIA (CONT.)
           Nurse, where's my daughter? Call
           her forth to me.

          

           NURSE
           I bade her come. God forbid!
           Where's this girl?
           Juliet!

          
          CUT TO: The top of the stairs. As if from nowhere, Juliet
          has appeared. She wears a bathrobe and her hair is wet.

          

           JULIET

           (COOLLY)
           Madam, I am here. What is you will.

          
          Gloria, startled, sweeps up the stairs and shuffles her
          daughter toward a doorway.

          

           GLORIA
           Nurse, give leave awhile, we must
           talk in secret.

          

          INT. GLORIA'S DRESSING ROOM. DAY.


          
          Gloria shepherds Juliet into her opulent dressing room and
          closes the door. She circles with nervous vexation searching
          for words, stops, then suddenly opens the door and yells out
          to the Nurse.

          

           GLORIA (CONT.)
           Nurse, come back again.
           I have remembered me, thou's hear
           our counsel.

          
          The Nurse enters. Gloria, still refusing eye contact,
          checks her appearance once more in the mirror. She takes a
          hairbrush and, feigning pleasantness, intensely brushes her
          hair.

          

           GLORIA (CONT.)
           Nurse, thou knowest my daughter's
           of a pretty age.

          

           NURSE
           (to Juliet)
           Thou wast the prettiest babe that
           e'er I nursed.

          
          The hair brush clatters onto the dresser. A moment of tense
          silence. Gloria grips herself and pours a sherry.

          
          Back still turned, she speaks to her daughter.

          

           GLORIA
           By my count, I was your mother much
           upon these years
           That you are now a maid.

          
          A nembutal twists like a pin in the corner of Gloria's mouth.
          She slugs it down with the sherry and turns abruptly to face
          Juliet.

          

           GLORIA (CONT.)
           Thus then in brief, the valiant
           Paris seeks you for his love.

          
          CUT TO: Juliet; an uncomprehending stare.

          
          The Nurse, caught off guard, tries to buoy the situation.

          

           NURSE
           A man, young lady! Lady, such a

           MAN
           As all the world - why, he's a man
           of wax.

          
          The medication takes immediate effect upon Gloria. She
          joins Juliet on the couch and coos in Paris's favour.

          

           GLORIA
           Verona's summer hath not such a
           flower.

          

           NURSE
           Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a
           very flower.

          

           GLORIA
           This night you shall behold him at
           our feast;
           Read o'er the volume of young
           Paris' face
           And find delight writ there with
           beauty's pen.
           This precious book of love, this
           unbound lover,
           To beautify him only lacks a cover.
           So shall you share all that he doth
           possess,
           By having him, making yourself no
           less.

          
          Gloria probes Juliet's thoughts.

          

           GLORIA
           Can you like of Paris' love?

          
          Juliet, adept at negotiating her mother's strange moods,
          chooses her words precisely.

          

           JULIET
           I'll look to like, if looking
           liking move,
           But no more deep will I endart mine
           eye,
           Than your consent gives strength to
           make it fly.

          
          PETER the chauffeur enters.

          

           PETER
           Madam. The guests are come.

          

           GLORIA
           (checks the mirror)
           We follow thee.

          
          She exits, Nurse in tow.

          
          CLOSE ON: Juliet stares out the windows and across the water.

          
          Suddenly the Nurse's face leers into shot. She whispers
          enthusiastically into Juliet's ear.

          

           NURSE
           Go girl, seek happy nights to happy
           days.

          
          CLOSE ON: Juliet's face.

          

          EXT. CAPULET MANSION. DAY/NIGHT.


          
          JUMP CUT: Aerial shot of Capulet Mansion. We time lapse
          from late afternoon to night; fairy lights illuminate,
          guests appear, music swells, and a single incandescent
          flare, explodes pink against the inky sky.

          

          EXT. BEACH. NIGHT.


          
          CLOSE ON: Romeo: his face glows pink. He is sitting on the
          grubby shoreline of Verona Bay dressed as a boy King Arthur,
          with fake chain mail and sword.

          
          Romeo watches the dying flare sink into the bay. The sound
          of the party drifts across the water. Balthasar, dressed as
          Frankenstein's monster, touches a lighter to a large bong
          and Romeo inhales smoke.

          
          Behind them, Benvolio, drunk and dressed as a pizza, is
          yelling at Gregory, who, dressed as a Viking, is trying to
          cut slices off his pizza costume. Sampson, also dressed as
          a Viking, sits in the back of a car. One arm is bandaged
          and he swigs from a bottle.

          
          Suddenly the darkness is slashed by headlights. A reckless
          sports car speeds toward the boys. Stereo screaming, the
          car skids to a halt.

          
          CLOSE ON: Music blares from the sound system. A silver
          stilettoed foot emerges from the car and plants itself
          firmly in the dirt.

          
          CUT TO: The boys, eyes wide with amazement.

          
          CUT TO: Another stiletto follows the first. Guitar groans.

          
          PAN: Slowly up a shapely pair of black stockinged legs, past
          a hint of garter belt to a black sequined mini-skirt and up
          over a muscular dark skinned stomach and tiny sequined bra
          top, to discover: the 21 year old male, African American
          face of MERCUTIO.

          
          CUT TO: The boys. Recovering from the initial shock, they
          laugh and cat-call raucously.

          
          CUT TO: Mercutio. He roughly jams a short black wig onto
          his head and yells above the music.

          

           MERCUTIO
           Strike drum!

          
          Mercutio magically produces invitations from somewhere
          within his mini-skirt and dances down the beach to the boys.

          
          Aggressively bumping and grinding, Mercutio distributes the
          invitations. Reaching Romeo, he declares:

          

           MERCUTIO
           We'll on without apology.

          
          Romeo lets the invitation fall to the sand.

          

           ROMEO
           I am not for this ambling.
           Being but heavy, I will bear the
           light.

          
          Romeo pulls on the bong once more.

          
          Suddenly, Mercutio is upon Romeo. Hauling him to his feet,
          he waltzes him through the sand.

          

           MERCUTIO
           Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you
           dance.

          
          Romeo pushes Mercutio away.

          

           ROMEO
           Not I, believe me. You have
           dancing shoes
           With nimble soles. I have a soul
           of lead.

          
          Mercutio in mock sympathy.

          

           MERCUTIO
           Too great oppression for a tender
           thing.

          

           ROMEO
           Is love a tender thing? It is too
           rough, too rude, too boisterous,
           and it pricks like thorn.

          
          Romeo lies staring up at the stars.

          

           MERCUTIO
           If love be rough with you, be rough
           with love.

          
          Mercutio jumps on Romeo.

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)
           Prick love for pricking, and you
           beat love down.

          
          Romeo fights Mercutio off.

          

           ROMEO
           Under love's heavy burden do I sink!

          
          CUT TO: Benvolio, impatiently honking the horn.

          

           BENVOLIO
           Every man betake him to his legs!

          
          Mercutio heads Romeo toward the car.

          

           MERCUTIO
           Come, we burn daylight, ho!

          
          Romeo pulls away.

          

           ROMEO
           But 'tis no wit to go.

          
          Mercutio turns, exasperated.

          

           MERCUTIO
           Why, may one ask?

          

           ROMEO
           I dreamt a dream tonight.

          

           MERCUTIO
           And so did I.

          

           ROMEO
           Well, what was yours?

          

           MERCUTIO
           That dreamers often lie.

          

           ROMEO
           In bed asleep, while they do dream
           things true.

          
          Mercutio produces a tiny gold pill case.

          

           MERCUTIO
           O, then I see Queen Mab hath been
           with you.
           She is the fairies' midwife, and
           she comes
           In shape no bigger than an agate

           STONE
           On the forefinger of an alderman,
           Drawn with a team of little atomies
           Over men's noses as they lie asleep.

          
          Tantalisingly, he passes the case beneath Romeo's nose.

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)
           Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,
           Her wagoner a small gray-coated gnat.

          
          With a conjurer's dexterity Mercutio extracts a small, gray
          pill.

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)
           And in this state she gallops night
           by night
           Through lovers' brains, and then
           they dream of love;

          
          He palms the pills. It reappears from behind Romeo's ear.

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)
           O'er lawyers' fingers who straight
           dream on fees;
           O'er ladies' lips, who straight on
           kisses dream,
           Which oft the angry Mab with
           blisters plagues.
           Because their breaths with
           sweetmeats tainted are.

          
          The pill box glints in the moonlight.

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)
           Sometime she driveth o'er a
           soldier's neck;
           And then dreams he of cutting
           foreign throats.
           And being thus frighted, swears a
           prayer or two
           And sleeps again.

          
          Mercutio now intensely angry:

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)
           This is that very Mab
           That plaits the manes of horses in
           the night
           And bakes the elf-locks in foul
           sluttish hairs

          
          He screams into the night.

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)
           This is the hag, when maids lie on
           their backs,
           That presses them and learns them
           first to bear,
           Making them women of good carriage.
           This is she, this is she...

          
          CLOSE ON: Mercutio. He breaks off. There is a strange
          stillness amongst the group. Romeo goes to his friend.

          

           ROMEO
           Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace.
           Thou talkest of nothing.

          
          Mercutio meets Romeo's gaze.

          

           MERCUTIO
           True, I talk of dreams;
           Which are the children of an idle
           brain,
           Begot of nothing but vain fantasy.
           Which is as thin of substance as
           the air
           And more inconstant than the wind,
           who woos
           Even now the frozen bosom of the

           NORTH
           And, being angered, puffs away from

           THENCE
           Turning his attention to the dew-
           dropping south.

          
          CUT TO: Benvolio in the car. The alcohol has caught up with
          him and he looks a little queasy.

          

           BENVOLIO
           This wind you talk of blows us from

           OURSELVES:
           Supper is done and we shall come
           too late.

          
          Romeo looks toward the distant city.

          

           ROMEO
           I fear, too early, for my mind

           MISGIVES
           Some consequence yet hanging in the

           STARS
           Shall bitterly begin his fearful

           DATE
           With this night's revels, and
           expire the term
           Of a despised life closed in my
           breast,
           By some vile forfeit of untimely
           death.

          
          PAUSE: The water turns golden as fireworks explode across
          the bay. Romeo smiles.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           But he that hath the steerage of my

           COURSE
           Direct my sail!

          
          He takes the pill and drops it into his mouth.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           On, lusty gentlemen!

          
          With the rush of a mind altering cocktail, we ZOOM IN on
          Romeo's eyes; they shimmer with the shooting star reflection
          of exploding fireworks - a bending Eastern chord, we launch
          into Donna Summer's 'I Feel Love', sung by the vocalist from
          Soundgarden with orchestration by 'Deconstruction' and sitar
          by Ravi Shankar.

          

          EXT. MERCUTIO'S CAR - ON FREEWAY. NIGHT.


          
          PULL OUT: From Romeo's eyes. He is lying in the passenger
          seat of Mercutio's convertible as it rockets along the
          freeway. The camera is directly above Romeo. He stares up
          at the fireworks that reflect in the windshield. The car
          and freeway begin to rotate and the camera follows. We feel
          that the car is now travelling upside-down. The camera
          sways through a brilliant explosion of fireworks that fill
          the screen with a zillion pixilating, colored dots of fire.

          

          INT. CAPULET'S MANSION - BALLROOM. NIGHT.


          
          PULL OUT: To discover the glittering dots of fire refracting
          from the sparkling domed roof of the magnificently ornate
          Capulet Ballroom. The camera swoops down over bizarrely
          costumed revellers cavorting to a driving Latin big band.
          The camera partners with a drugged Mercutio and Benvolio who
          shamelessly caper with each other in a mock antic adagio.

          
          CUT TO: Romeo gazing blankly at the dance floor.

          
          CUT TO: Mercutio. He sweeps up a thirty-something
          sophisticate and twirls her in Romeo's direction.

          

           MERCUTIO
           Everyman betake him to his legs!

          
          Romeo moves off through the crowd.

          
          CUT TO: ROMEO'S P.O.V.: Contorted images of costumed guests
          eat, drink and laugh in a grotesque collision of Yves Saint
          Laurent cocktail party and Bacchanalian romp.

          
          Suddenly a large arm coils around Romeo's neck.

          
          DISTORTED EXTREME CLOSE UP: A seriously intoxicated Fulgencio
          Capulet; his puffy red face squeezes against Romeo's.

          

           CAPULET
           Ah, I have seen the day that I

           COULD
           Tell a whispering tale in a fair
           ladies ear.
           Such as would please.

          
          Capulet screams above the music:

          

           CAPULET (CONT.)
           Come musicians play!

          
          Blood drums in Romeo's ears. Breaking free from Capulet's
          grasp as he pushes through the crowd toward the bathroom.

          

          INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT.


          
          Silent, underwater shot. Romeo's tranquil features submerged
          in a basin of water.

          

          BEAT.

          
          With a gasp, Romeo rises. A moment. His breathing calms.
          Then, smoothing water into his hair, he gazes into the
          bathroom mirror. He turns:

          
          The entire wall opposite the mirror, is a magnificent salt-
          water fish tank.

          
          Romeo, drawn by it's submarine beauty, leans against the
          fish tank. Applause echoes faintly through the bathroom
          speakers.

          

          INT. BALLROOM. NIGHT.


          
          As the applause dies, a dark-haired Latina Diva takes the
          spotlight. The band ease into the opening bars of a love
          ballad.

          

          INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT.


          
          As the music swells, Romeo watches a moustached catfish
          glide past a medieval castle.

          
          Suddenly, Romeo pulls away. Peering back at him through the
          castle is a pair of exquisitely beautiful angelic eyes.

          
          The Diva's first pure, achingly beautiful notes soar.

          
          Confused, Romeo looks again. There is no mistake - it is a
          girl. Through a shimmering curtain of ribbon weed, two dark
          wide eyes, a childish nose and sumptuous full lips.

          
          Romeo pushes his face closer to the glass. The other face
          snaps abruptly away.

          

          INT. POWDER ROOM. NIGHT.


          
          CUT TO: Juliet, dressed as an angel, on the other side of
          the tank. We now realise that the girls' powder room and
          the boys' bathroom are divided by this watery wonder world.

          
          Juliet warily moves closer to the glass.

          

          INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT.


          
          Romeo leans his face against the glass. The love ballad
          builds.

          
          SLOW TRACK: From Romeo's profile, in through the water, and...

          

          INT. POWDER ROOM. NIGHT.


          
          ...out the other side, to find Juliet in profile, peering
          into the tank.

          

          INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT.


          
          Romeo presses his nose lightly against the glass.

          

          INT. POWDER ROOM. NIGHT.


          
          Juliet; a tiny smile.

          
          Suddenly, CRASH! The door slams open. Juliet turns,
          startled. It is the Nurse.

          

           NURSE
           Juliet, your mother calls.

          
          The Nurse bustles Juliet out the door. Juliet looks over
          her shoulder at the mystery boy.

          

          INT. BALLROOM. NIGHT.


          
          Romeo, now without his mask, slams out of the bathroom -
          Juliet and the Nurse have disappeared into the crowd.

          
          CUT TO: Juliet being dragged along by the Nurse. She
          glances back toward the mystery boy, but he is gone.

          
          Juliet and the Nurse rejoin Dave Paris, who is dressed as an
          astronaut, and Gloria, at the side of the dance floor.

          
          Dave, irresistible smile, extends his hand to Juliet.

          

           DAVE
           Will you now deny to dance?

          
          Juliet looks to Dave, desperately searching for a reason to
          decline. Gloria, brushing aside her silly daughter's
          protests, slugs the last of her champagne and corrals them
          onto the dance floor.

          

           GLORIA
           (whispering to Juliet)
           A man, young lady, such a man.

          
          As Juliet is dragged onto the floor her eyes furtively
          search for the boy.

          
          CUT TO: Romeo in the crowd. Desperate to find the girl, he
          roughly shunts aside a reveller dressed as Lucifer, Prince
          of Darkness.

          
          HOLD ON: Lucifer. He removes his mask: it is Tybalt. He
          turns to Abra, who's dressed as a demon.

          

           TYBALT
           What, dares the slave come hither
           to fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
           Now by the stock and honor of my

           KIN
           To strike him dead I hold it not a
           sin.

          
          Tybalt moves off aggressively, but is halted as Capulet
          slams a hand into his chest.

          

           CAPULET
           Why how now kinsman, wherefore
           storm you so?

          

           TYBALT
           Uncle, this is that villain Romeo.
           A Montague, our foe.

          
          Capulet peers across the ballroom.

          

           CAPULET
           Young Romeo is it?

          

           TYBALT
           'Tis he.

          

           CAPULET
           Content thee gentle coz, let him
           alone.
           I would not for the wealth of all
           this town
           Here in my house do him
           disparagement.
           Therefore be patient; take no note
           of him.

          
          Tybalt can't believe it.

          

           TYBALT
           I'll not endure him.

          
          CLOSE ON: Capulet, exploding with rage.

           CAPULET
           He shall be endured!
           (slapping Tybalt viciously)
           What, goodman boy! I say he shall!
           Go to.

          
          Capulet violently shoves Tybalt to the ground.

          

           CAPULET
           You'll make a mutiny among my guests!

          
          A middle aged couple look on shocked - Capulet waves to them

          FESTIVELY:

          

           CAPULET
           What? Cheerly my hearts!

          
          Capulet snorts at Tybalt in disgust.

          

           CAPULET
           You'll not endure him! Am I the
           master here or you? Go to.

          
          Smoothing his hair into place, Capulet turns back into the
          ballroom.

          
          CLOSE ON: Tybalt choking back tears of rage.

          
          CUT TO: Romeo moving through the crowd. For a moment the
          crush clears and he spies the Angel on the dance floor.

          
          CLOSE ON: Romeo whispers:

          

           ROMEO
           Did my heart love till now?
           Forswear it, sight.
           For I ne'er saw true beauty till
           this night.

          
          Romeo begins to circumnavigate the dance floor in an attempt
          to get closer to Juliet.

          
          CUT TO: Dave slow dancing with Juliet.

          
          Juliet's eyes search the room for the boy.

          
          CLOSE ON: Romeo.

          
          CLOSE ON: Juliet.

          
          Their eyes connect.

          
          Juliet looks quickly back to Dave who, oblivious, returns
          his most devastating smile.

          
          CUT TO: The songstress, her voice soars.

          
          CUT TO: Juliet. Unable to look away from the boy, she
          stares over Dave's shoulder.

          
          CUT TO: Romeo. Ignoring the danger, he continues to move
          toward the Angel.

          
          With the Diva's spiralling final notes, the ballad concludes.

          
          A complete black out. As the crowd break into wild applause,
          Juliet's eyes search the darkness, but the boy is gone.

          
          The crowd cheers and screams its applause. An avalanche of
          balloons, tinsel and confetti rains down from the roof;
          swathes of red silk drop from the ceiling and the space is
          transformed.

          
          CLOSE ON: Juliet, searching for the boy.

          
          Suddenly: A gasp, Juliet's eyes widen, shocked.

          
          In the dark, a hand has shot out from the drape curtaining
          off the stage and clasped hers. Juliet barely dares breathe.

          
          She glances furtively to Dave Paris - he watches the stage.

          
          Slowly Juliet turns toward the hand; there through a break
          in the curtain she can see eye, cheek and lips of the
          mystery boy. As the Diva reprises the chorus, Romeo gently
          pulls Juliet behind the curtain.

          

          INT. BEHIND CURTAIN. NIGHT.


          
          Concealed from the party by the red velvet drape, hands
          still clasped, the teenagers are so close their bodies
          almost touch.

          

           ROMEO
           If I profane with my unworthiest

           HAND
           This holy shrine, the gentle sin is
           this.
           My lips, two blushing pilgrims,
           ready stand
           To smooth that rough touch with a
           tender kiss.

          
          Romeo moves his lips toward Juliet's. She stops him.

          

           JULIET
           Good pilgrim, you do wrong your
           hand too much,
           Which mannerly devotion shows in
           this.
           For saints have hands that pilgrim's
           hands do touch,
           And palm to palm is holy palmers'
           kiss.

          

           ROMEO
           Have not saints lips, and holy
           palmers too?

          

           JULIET
           (a gentle scolding)
           Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must
           use in prayer.

          

           ROMEO
           O, then, dear saint, let lips do
           what hands do,
           They pray: grant thou, lest faith
           turn to despair.

          

           JULIET
           Saints do not move, though grant
           for prayer's sake.

          

           ROMEO
           Then move not while my prayer's
           effect I take.

          
          He kisses her.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           Thus from my lips, by thine my sin
           is purged.

          

           JULIET
           Then have my lips the sin that they
           have took.

          

           ROMEO
           Sin from my lips? O trespass
           sweetly urged!
           Give me my sin again.

          
          He kisses her.

          

           JULIET
           You kiss by th' book.

          
          They kiss again.

          
          Suddenly a harsh light falls across the entwined couple.
          They break apart - Nurse has pulled open the curtain and
          stands eyeing them severely.

          

           NURSE
           Madam, your mother craves a word
           with you.

          
          We see that the party is breaking up. But for groups of
          die-hard revellers, the room is nearly empty.

          

           NURSE (CONT.)
           Come, let's away.

          
          She takes firm control of her charge.

          
          Juliet furtively motions for the startled Romeo not to
          follow as he trails them across the room.

          
          CUT TO: ROMEO'S P.O.V.: The Nurse and Juliet reach the door,
          but instead of leaving, they turn and ascend the staircase
          that arcs around to the mezzanine level. They join a vexed
          Gloria Capulet who clings to a patient Dave Paris.

          
          Inaudible words are exchanged. Juliet flickers her eyes
          nervously to Romeo.

          
          CUT TO: Romeo. He halts at the foot of the stairs unsure.

          
          CUT TO: Gloria. Catching Juliet's interest in the boy, she
          indicates to her daughter to 'COME ALONG'.

          
          CUT TO: Romeo; a dawning realisation.

          

           ROMEO
           (under his breath)
           Is she a Capulet?

          
          CUT TO: Juliet. She stops and turns back.

          
          CUT TO: Romeo, comprehending the reality of who she is.

          
          CUT TO: Juliet. The Nurse whispers in her ear.

          

           NURSE
           His name is Romeo, and a Montague,
           The only son of your great enemy.

          
          An orchestral treatment of Joy Division's "Love will tear us
          Apart" swells;

          
          HOLD ON: Juliet. Like a cloud passing across the sun, a
          dark coldness descends upon her.

          
          CUT TO: Mercutio. He throws himself upon the shell shocked
          Romeo.

          

           MERCUTIO
           Away, begone, the sport is at its
           best.

          
          Mercutio shuttles Romeo toward the door.

          

           ROMEO
           Ay so I fear,

          
          A covert glance over his shoulder.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           The more is my unrest.

          

          EXT. CAPULET MANSION. NIGHT.


          
          Mercutio bundles Romeo through the front door and down the
          stairs to the waiting getaway car.

          

          INT. CAPULET MANSION - STAIRS ALCOVE WINDOW - NIGHT.


          
          CUT TO: Juliet. Manoeuvred by the Nurse up the stairs, she
          breaks away and rushes to a tiny, windowed alcove.

          

          EXT. CAPULET MANSION - MAIN ENTRANCE. NIGHT.


          
          CUT TO: Mercutio's convertible and its noisy confederacy
          joining the line of departing limos.

          
          A huge sign combusts into blinding fireworks that write in
          giant words "CAPULET."

          
          As the convertible passes beneath the blazing words, Romeo
          turns. Through a deluge of falling sparks, he glimpses the
          mystery girl high up in the tower.

          

          EXT. CAPULET MANSION - WINDOW. NIGHT.


          
          CLOSE ON: Juliet leaning out of the tower window. Brilliant
          sparkles light in her eyes.

          
          PUSH IN: We hear her secret whisper:

          

           JULIET
           My only love, sprung from my only
           hate.
           Too early seen unknown, and known
           too late.
           Prodigious birth of love it is to me

          

          EXT. CAPULET MANSION - MAIN ENTRANCE DRIVE. NIGHT.


          
          CUT TO: JULIET'S P.O.V.: In slow motion Romeo, through the
          falling curtain of fiery embers.

          

           JULIET (CONT.)(V/O)
           That I must love a loathed enemy.

          

          EXT. CAPULET MANSION - WINDOW. NIGHT.


          
          Warm wind blows the smoke from the expended fireworks.
          Juliet closes the window and leans against the glass.

          
          CRANE DOWN: The side of the building past revellers who
          don't know when to leave. Standing in the front doorway is
          someone else who cannot take their eyes off the departing
          Romeo. It is Tybalt. The music darkens as we push through
          the smoky wind.

          

           TYBALT
           I will withdraw. But this intrusion
           shall,
           Now seeming sweet, convert to
           bitterest gall.

          

          INT. MERCUTIO'S CAR. NIGHT.


          
          Caught in the jam of departing vehicles, Mercutio's car
          crawls along the bridge that links Capulet island with the
          mainland. The boys sing along raucously with the radio.

          

           BOYS
           "I am a pretty piece of flesh,
           I am a pretty piece of flesh..."

          
          PUSH IN: On Romeo, he whispers:

          

           ROMEO
           Can I go forward when my heart is
           here?
           Turn back, dull earth, and find thy
           centre out.

          
          Romeo leaps from the car. Benvolio yells after him.

          

           BENVOLIO
           Romeo! Cousin Romeo! Romeo!

          

          EXT. CAPULET BRIDGE. NIGHT.


          
          Romeo runs back along the bridge toward the estate. At the
          gates, armed guards supervise the exodus of vehicles. Romeo
          uses the traffic to shield himself from view.

          
          Romeo leaps from the bridge and into the shadows at the base
          of the high stone wall that borders the compound.

          

          EXT. CAPULET BRIDGE. NIGHT.


          
          Mercutio's car prowls back along the bridge. The last
          guests have departed and the gates are swinging shut. The
          convertible halts in front of them.

          

           BENVOLIO
           He ran this way. Call, good
           Mercutio.

          

           MERCUTIO
           Nay, I'll conjure too.

          
          Mercutio leaps from the car. He postures like a magician in
          a low-budget variety special. The boys cheer him on.

          

           MERCUTIO
           Romeo! Humours! Madman! Passion!
           Lover!
           I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright
           eyes,
           By her high forehead and her
           scarlet lip,
           By her fine foot, straight leg, and
           quivering thigh.
           And the demesnes that there adjacent
           lie,
           That in thy likeness thou appear to
           us!

          

          EXT. CAPULET WALL. NIGHT.


          
          CLOSE ON: Romeo's fake chain mail shirt tangled in the
          barbed wire at the top of the wall.

          
          PAN DOWN: Romeo, now on the other side of the wall, pulls up
          his undershirt and gingerly inspects the cuts inflicted by
          the wire.

          
          Mercutio's cavorting echoes from the bridge. Romeo smiles
          ironically.

          

           ROMEO
           He jests at scars that never felt a
           wound.

          
          Romeo moves off through the darkened grounds of Capulet
          estate.

          

          EXT. CAPULET BRIDGE. NIGHT.


          
          The boys laugh hysterically as Mercutio staggers around the
          bridge in imitation of a love sick fool.

          

           MERCUTIO
           O Romeo, that she were, O that she

           WERE
           An open-arse and thou a poperin pear!

          
          The hilarity is abruptly arrested as a security spotlight
          blazes to life, pinning Mercutio in its beam. The sound of
          automatic weapons cocking pierces the night.

          
          CLOSE ON: Mercutio. He's brave but not stupid. He gets
          back into the car.

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)
           Come, shall we go?

          

          EXT. THE BACK OF CAPULET MANSION. NIGHT.


          
          CLOSE ON: A pair of stone cherubs on top of the retaining
          wall of a terraced garden. Romeo's face appears between them.

          
          Romeo hauls himself up onto the wall. Below is a Greco-
          Roman style pool area. To the right the darkened rear wing
          of Capulet Mansion. Suddenly the back of the house explodes
          with light. Romeo takes cover.

          

           ROMEO
           But soft, what light through yonder
           window breaks?

          
          Romeo's question is answered as out onto the verandah comes
          Juliet. She is still clad in her angel robe, but without
          the halo and wings. She slowly descends to pool level.

          

           ROMEO
           It is the East, and Juliet is the
           sun!
           Arise, fair sun, and kill the
           envious moon,
           Who is already sick and pale with

           GRIEF
           That thou her maid art far more
           fair than she.
           Be not her maid, since she is
           envious.
           Her vestal livery is but sick and
           green,
           And none but fools do wear it.
          Juliet stands on the top step of the pool stairs. She is
          directly below Romeo as he whispers.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           Cast it off!

          
          Juliet sits on the edge of the pool, her legs dangle in the
          water.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           It is my lady. O, it is my love!
           O that she knew she were!

          
          Juliet sighs.

          

           JULIET
           Ay me!

          

           ROMEO

           (WHISPERS)
           She speaks.
           O, speak again, bright angel!

          
          Juliet looks longingly toward the stars.

          

           JULIET
           O Romeo, Romeo! - Whyfore art thou
           Romeo?
           Deny thy father and refuse thy
           name.
           Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn
           my love,
           And I'll no longer be a Capulet.

          
          CLOSE ON: Romeo. Incredulous.

          

           ROMEO
           Shall I hear more, or shall I speak
           at this?

          

           JULIET
           'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
           Thou are thyself, though not a
           Montague.
           What's Montague? It is not hand
           nor foot
           Nor arm nor face nor any other part
           Belonging to a man. O, be some
           other name!
           What's in a name?
           That which we call a rose
           By any other word would smell as
           sweet.
           So Romeo would, were he not Romeo
           called,
           Retain that dear perfection which
           he owes
           Without that title. Romeo, doff
           thy name,
           And for thy name, which is no part
           of thee,
           Take all myself.

          
          Romeo wildly calls:

          

           ROMEO
           I take thee at thy word!
           Call me but love, and I'll be new
           baptised.
           Henceforth I never will be Romeo.

          
          Romeo jumps down from the wall. Juliet screams, and turns,
          toppling backwards. Romeo grabs her hand but her momentum
          overbalances him and they both plunge headlong into the pool.

          Underwater shot: A slow motion phosphorescent tangle of
          arms, legs and bodies.

          

          EXT. CAPULET MANSION - BACK GARDEN. NIGHT.


          
          CUT TO: A security guard. Alerted by the noise he moves
          toward the pool area.

          

          EXT. CAPULET MANSION - POOL GARDEN - NIGHT.


          
          CUT TO: Above water, real time: Romeo and Juliet surface
          spluttering. Juliet thrashes the water in an attempt to get
          distance from her attacker.

          

           JULIET
           What man art thou that, thus
           bescreened in night,
           So stumblest on my counsel?

          
          Romeo: A calming gesture as he tries to tread water.

          

           ROMEO
           By a name I know not how to tell
           thee who I am:
           My name, dear saint, is hateful to

           MYSELF
           Because it is an enemy to thee.
          The ferocious barking of a guard dog arrests the teenagers
          attention. A moment, then they slide beneath the water.

          
          CUT TO: The security guard and dog appearing above the pool
          area.

          
          GUARD'S P.O.V.: The rippling surface of the water.

          streaming, stare at each other like two beautiful fish.

          
          CUT TO: The guard. He can see noisy caterers cleaning up
          around the other side of the house. Frowning, he returns
          the way he came.

          
          CUT TO: Romeo and Juliet. Gasping for air, they cautiously
          surface. A moment - then Juliet, a small smile.

          

           JULIET
           Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?

          

           ROMEO
           Neither, fair maid, if either thee
           dislike.

          
          Juliet looks nervously toward the house. She drags Romeo
          toward a small grotto at the end of the pool.

          

           JULIET
           How cam'st thou hither, tell me,
           and whyfore?
           The garden walls are high and hard
           to climb,
           And the place death, considering
           who thou art.

          

           ROMEO
           (with splashy bravado)
           With love's light wings did I o'er
           perch these walls.
           For stony limits cannot hold love
           out,
           And what love can do, that dares
           love attempt.
           Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop
           to me.

          
          Juliet drags Romeo firmly into the grotto.

          

           JULIET
           (a real fear)
           If they do see thee, they will
           murder thee.

          
          Romeo slowly pulls Juliet toward him.

          

           ROMEO
           I have night's cloak to hide me
           from their eyes.
           And but thou love me, let them find
           me here.
           My life were better ended by their

           HATE
           Than death prorogued, wanting of
           thy love.

          
          The lovers kiss long and deep. Then Juliet, suddenly
          fearful, pushes Romeo away.

          

           JULIET
           Thou knowest the mask of night is
           on my face,
           Else would a maiden blush bepaint
           my cheek,
           For that which thou hast heard me
           speak tonight.
           Fain would I dwell on form - fain,
           fain deny
           What I have spoke. But farewell
           compliment!
           Dost thou love me?

          
          Romeo tries to speak, Juliet silences him.

          

           JULIET (CONT.)
           I know thou wilt say 'Ay', and I
           will take thy word. Yet, if thou
           swearest,
           Thou mayst prove false. O gentle
           Romeo,
           If thou dost love, pronounce it
           faithfully.
           Or if thou think'st I am too
           quickly won,
           I'll frown, and be perverse, and
           say thee nay,
           So thou wilt woo. But else, not
           for the world.
           In truth, fair Montague, I am too
           fond,
           And therefore thou mayst think my
           'haviour light.
           But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove
           more true
           Than those that have more cunning
           to be strange.

          

           ROMEO
           Lady, by yonder blessed moon I vow,
           That tips with silver all these
           fruit-tree tops -

          

           JULIET
           O, swear not by the moon, th'
           inconstant moon,
           That monthly changes in her circled
           orb,
           Lest that thy love prove likewise
           variable.

          

           ROMEO
           What shall I swear by?

          

           JULIET
           Do not swear at all.
           Or if thou wilt, swear by thy
           gracious self,
           Which is the god of my idolatry,
           And I'll believe thee.

          
          She touches his cheek. Romeo moves his lips close.

          

           ROMEO
           If my heart's dear love -

          
          Confused, Juliet breaks away.

          

           JULIET
           Well, do not swear. Although I joy
           in thee,
           I have no joy of this contract
           tonight.
           It is too rash, too unadvised, too

           SUDDEN;
           Too like the lightning, which doth
           cease to be
           Ere one can say 'it lightens.'
           Sweet, good night.
           This bud of love, by summer's
           ripening breath,
           May prove a beauteous flower when
           next we meet.
           Good night, good night. As sweet
           repose and rest
           Come to thy heart as that within my
           breast.

          
          She rushes up the stairs - Romeo follows desperately.

          

           ROMEO
           O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

          
          Juliet - a shocked look.

          

           JULIET
           What satisfaction canst thou have
           tonight?

          
          CLOSE ON: Romeo.

          

           ROMEO
           The exchange of thy love's faithful
           vow for mine.

          
          CLOSE ON: Juliet. She runs joyously to Romeo.

          

           JULIET
           I gave thee mind before thou didst
           request it!

          
          Kissing him passionately.

          

           JULIET (CONT.)
           And yet I would it were to give
           again.

          

           ROMEO
           Wouldst thou withdraw it? For what
           purpose love?

          

           JULIET
           But to be frank and give it thee
           again.

          
          They kiss again. The Nurse calls from inside.

          

           NURSE (O/S)
           Juliet!

          
          Juliet looks to the house.

          

           JULIET

           (BREATHLESSLY)
           Three words, dear Romeo, and good
           night indeed.
           If that thy bent of love be
           honourable.
           Thy purpose marriage, send me word
           tomorrow,
           By one that I'll procure to come to
           thee,
           Where and what time thou wilt
           perform the rite,
           And all my fortunes at thy foot
           I'll lay
           And follow thee my lord throughout
           the world.

          

           NURSE (O/S)
           Madam!

          

           JULIET
           I come, anon - But if thou meanest
           not well,
           I do beseech thee...

          

           NURSE (O/S)
           Madam!

          

           JULIET
           (to Nurse)
           By and by I come!
           To cease thy strife and leave me to
           my grief.
           Tomorrow will I send.

          
          Romeo holds Juliet's gaze.

          

           ROMEO
           So thrive my soul.

          

           NURSE (O/S)
           Madam!

          
          Juliet breaks away.

          

           JULIET
           A thousand times good night!

          
          With a final kiss, Juliet runs inside.

          

           ROMEO
           A thousand times the worse, to want
           thy light.
           Love goes toward love as schoolboys
           from their books;
           But love from love, toward school
           with heavy looks.

          
          Juliet re-appears at the upper balcony.

          

           JULIET
           Romeo! What o'clock tomorrow
           Shall I send to thee?

          

           ROMEO
           By the hour of nine.

          
          Juliet unclasps a delicate silver necklace from around her
          neck.

          

           JULIET
           I will not fail. 'Tis twenty year
           till then.
           Goodnight, goodnight! Parting is
           such sweet sorrow.
           That I shall say goodnight till it
           be morrow.

          
          She lets the necklace fall from her hand. Romeo catches it
          and she is gone.

          

           ROMEO
           Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace
           in thy breast,
           Would I were sleep and peace, so
           sweet to rest.

          

          INT. GREENHOUSE. DAWN.


          
          Morning sunlight filters through the lush foliage of a
          tropical rainforest.

          
          PAN DOWN: As we hear:

          

           FATHER LAURENCE (O/S)
           O mickle is the powerful grace that

           LIES
           In plants, herbs, stones, and their
           true qualities.

          
          We discover the intensely concentrating features of FATHER
          LAURENCE. Fifties, wiry and wearing a priest's collar,
          Laurence delicately makes an incision in the bulb of a small
          purple flowered plant.

          
          A pair of fresh faced ten year old boys look on in wonderment
          as a vivid blue sap oozes from the incision.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)
           Within the infant rind of this weak

           FLOWER
           Poison hath residence, and medicine
           power.

          
          PULL BACK: The Priest carefully gathers the sap into a
          beaker. We discover that we are in a small tropical
          greenhouse.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)
           (to the boys)
           For this, being smelt, with that
           part cheers each part;
           Being tasted, stays all senses with
           the heart.
          The boys follow the Father as he moves out of the greenhouse
          and into an adjoining work area. The walls are lined with
          bottles of herbs and dried plants and a television flickers
          in the corner.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)
           For naught so vile on the earth
           doth live,
           But to the earth some special good
           doth give;

          
          With the precision of a chemist, Father Laurence funnels the
          sap into a small bottle and places it in the refrigerator.
          From out of the refrigerator he produces a large jar of
          candy. He eyes the boys sternly.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)
           Nor aught so good but, strained
           from that fair use,
           Revolts from true birth, stumbling
           on abuse.

          
          The boys take their candy and scram.

          
          CUT TO: The muted television. A morning news program shows
          footage of a murder scene cordoned off with police tape. A
          distraught mother is being restrained.

          
          CLOSE ON: The priest contemplating the television.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           Two such opposed kings encamp them

           STILL
           In man as well as herbs: grace and
           rude will;
           And where the worser is predominant,
           Full soon the canker death eats up
           that plant.

          
          A feverish knocking breaks the priest's reverie.

          

           ROMEO (O/S)
           Good morrow, father!

          
          Father Laurence snaps off the television and exits the
          workroom.

          

          EXT. WALL. DAWN.


          
          Romeo, dressed in last night's chain mail, pounds desperately
          on a wooden door set into a high stone wall.

          

           ROMEO
           Good morrow, father!

          

          EXT. COURTYARD. DAWN.


          
          From the workroom, Father Laurence enters a courtyard which
          encloses a tranquil tropical garden. He opens a door in the
          wall of the courtyard and smiles as the costumed Romeo
          bursts in.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           Benedicite!
           What early tongue so sweet saluteth
           me?

          
          Without pausing, the priest continues through the courtyard
          and toward the church.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)
           Young son, it argues a distempered

           HEAD
           So soon to bid good morrow to thy
           bed.
           Or if not so, then here I hit it
           right -
           Our Romeo hath not been in bed
           tonight.

          
          The priest enters the back of the church.

          

          INT. SACRISTY. DAWN.


          
          Romeo, on fire to tell of his experience, follows the priest
          into the sacristy.

          

           ROMEO
           The last is true. The sweeter rest
           was mine.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           (he stops)
           God pardon sin! Wast thou with
           Rosaline?

          

           ROMEO
           With Rosaline, my ghostly father?
           No.
           I have forgot that name and that
           name's woe.

          
          The Father lays out the cut glass bottles and communion tray
          for mass.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           That's my good son! But where hast
           thou been then?

          
          Unconsciously, Romeo helps the priest prepare. It is clear
          he knows the routine by heart.

          

           ROMEO
           I have been feasting with mine
           enemy,
           Where on a sudden one hath wounded
           me.
           That's by me wounded. Both our

           REMEDIES
           Within they help and holy physic
           lies.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           (buttoning a long
           black cassock)
           Be plain, good son, and homely in
           thy drift.
           Riddling confession finds but
           riddling shrift.

          

           ROMEO
           Then plainly know my heart's dear
           love is set,
           On the fair daughter of rich
           Capulet.
           We met, we wooed, and made exchange
           of vow,
           I'll tell thee as we pass. But
           this I pray,
           That thou consent to marry us today.

          
          CUT TO: The Priest, thunderstruck. The two kids, now
          dressed in red altar-boy robes, enter.

          

           ALTAR BOYS
           Good morrow, Romeo.

          
          The apoplectic priest waves the boys away. They get the
          message and bolt.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           Holy Saint Francis! What a change
           is here!
           Is Rosaline, that thou didst love
           so dear,
           So soon foresaken? Young men's
           love then lies
           Not truly in their hearts, but in
           their eyes.

          

           ROMEO
           Thou chid'st me oft for loving
           Rosaline.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           (very angry)
           For doting, not for loving, pupil
           mine.

          

           ROMEO
           I pray thee chide me not. Her I
           love now
           Doth grace for grace and love for
           love allow.
           The other did not so.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           O, she knew well
           Thy love did read by rote, that
           could not spell.

          
          The Father falls into a chair and considers. He looks
          through the sacristy door to where a small children's choir
          has assembled. Their angelic voices soar into the purest of
          hymns.

          

           CHOIR
           How can you just leave me standing
           Alone in a world so cold,
           Maybe I'm just too demanding,
           Maybe I'm just like my father, too
           bold,
           Maybe you're just like my mother,
           She's never satisfied.
           Why do we scream at each other?
           This is what it sounds like when
           doves cry...

          
          We recognise the hymn as "When Doves Cry" by Prince.

          
          PUSH IN: On the Priest; moved, he looks to Romeo.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           But come, young waverer, come, go
           with me.
           In one respect I'll thy assistant
           be.
           For this alliance may so happy

           PROVE
           To turn your households' rancor to
           pure love.

          
          Romeo hurriedly assists the priest with his vestments.

          

           ROMEO
           O, let us hence! I stand on sudden
           haste.

          
          Father Laurence holds Romeo in his powerful gaze.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           Wisely and slow. They stumble that
           run fast.

          
          The procession is joined by the two little altar boys and
          the mass begins.

          

          EXT. VERONA BEACH. DAY.


          
          As the Angelic voices of the choir soar, we see a pay phone
          etched with hyper-real starkness against the white sand,
          green sea and blue sky.

          
          A single leaning palm tree frames the image like a ridiculous
          tourist postcard.

          
          Benvolio speaks on the pay phone. Mercutio, torso naked but
          for his holstered Sports Rapier 9mm, drums his fingers on
          the side of the booth.

          

           MERCUTIO
           Where the devil should this Romeo
           be?
           Came he not home tonight?

          

           BENVOLIO
           (slamming down the phone)
           Not to his father's. I spoke with
           his man.

          
          Mercutio storms off down the beach.

          

           MERCUTIO
           Why, that same pale hard-hearted
           wench, that Rosaline,
           Torments him so that he will sure
           run mad.

          

           BENVOLIO
           (running to keep up)
           Tybalt hath sent a letter to his
           father's house.

          

           MERCUTIO
           (halts abruptly)
           A challenge, on my life.

          
          CLOSE ON: Benvolio, unsure.

          

           BENVOLIO
           Romeo will answer it?

          

           MERCUTIO
           Any man that can write may answer a
           letter.

          

           BENVOLIO
           Nay, he will answer the letter's
           master, how he dares, being dared.

          
          Mercutio clamps Benvolio into a headlock.

          

           MERCUTIO
           Alas, poor Romeo, he is already
           dead!
           Stabbed with a white wench's black
           eye,

          
          He whispers into Benvolio's ear:

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)
           Run through the ear with a love
           song.
           (in disgust)
           And is he a man to encounter Tybalt?

          

           BENVOLIO
           (struggling to break free)
           Why, what is Tybalt?

          

           MERCUTIO
           (releasing him)
           More than Prince of Cats, I can
           tell you.
           O, he's the courageous captain of
           compliments.
           The very butcher of a silk button.

          
          Lightening fast, Mercutio draws his gun. He twirls it in an
          impressive display of gunmanship which ends with the barrel
          between the startled Benvolio's eyes.

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)
           A duellist, a duellist.

          
          Romeo's car pulls into the beach side parking lot. Benvolio
          heads toward it.

          

           BENVOLIO
           Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo!

          

          EXT. BEACH - PARKING LOT. DAY.


          
          Romeo alights from his car and throws his keys to Balthasar
          who lounges outside the beach side hang. Mercutio saunters
          up the beach with mock nonchalance.

          

           MERCUTIO
           Signor Romeo, Bonjour. There's a
           French salutation to your French
           slop. You gave us the counterfeit
           fairly last night.

          

           ROMEO
           Good morrow to you both. What
           counterfeit did I give you?

          

           MERCUTIO
           The slip, sir, the slip. Can you
           not conceive?

          
          Romeo smiles smugly.

          

           ROMEO
           Pardon, good Mercutio. My business
           was great, and in such a case as
           mine a man may strain courtesy.

          

           MERCUTIO

           (SARCASTICALLY)
           A most courteous exposition.

          

           ROMEO
           Nay I am the very pink of courtesy.

          

           MERCUTIO

           (CAMPLY)
           Pink for flower?

          
          The boys laugh. Romeo feigns anger.

          

           ROMEO
           I will bite thee on the ear for
           that jest!

          
          Mercutio, goading Romeo to follow, backs off down the beach.

          

           MERCUTIO
           Come between us, good Benvolio! My
           wits faint.

          
          Mercutio flicks sand at Romeo, then sprints off down the
          beach. Romeo, laughing, gives chase.

          

           ROMEO
           Switch and spurs, switch and spurs,
           or I'll cry a match.

          

          EXT. BEACH - SHORELINE. DAY.


          
          Romeo is gaining on Mercutio, who runs headlong into the sea.
          With a yell, Romeo dives in after him.

          

          EXT. BEACH - AT SEA. DAY.


          
          Mercutio splashes the laughing Romeo.

          

           MERCUTIO
           Why, is not this better now than
           groaning for love?

          
          Romeo tries to dunk Mercutio.

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)
           Now art thou sociable.

          
          Mercutio, evading, heads for shore.

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)
           Now art thou Romeo. Now art thou...

          

          EXT. BEACH - SHORELINE. DAY.


          
          Romeo tackles Mercutio on the wet sand. Mercutio falls
          suddenly serious.

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)

           (QUIETLY)
           What thou art, by art as well as by
           nature.

          
          A moment between the boys. A shadow falls across them.
          Romeo looks up.

          

           ROMEO
           Here's goodly gear.

          
          Standing above the boys is the Nurse. She wears a
          ridiculous, all red, "Jackie O" style disguise of sunglasses,
          scarf and parasol.

          

           MERCUTIO

           (BEMUSED)
           God ye good e'en fair gentlewoman.

          
          The nurse, ignoring Mercutio, speaks dramatically to Romeo.

          

           NURSE
           I desire some confidence with you.

          
          She turns and walks back to the parking lot where Peter the
          chauffer waits beside the limousine.

          
          Benvolio and the other boys look on curiously.

          

           MERCUTIO
           A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!

          
          But Romeo rises and to the amazement of Mercutio actually
          follows this woman. Mercutio looks questioningly to
          Benvolio, who shrugs.

          

           BENVOLIO
           She will endite him to some supper?

          
          Even more strangely, Romeo gets into the limousine.

          

           MERCUTIO
           (taken by surprise)
           Romeo, will you come to your
           father's?
           We'll to dinner thither.

          

           ROMEO
           (as he closes the door)
           I will follow you.

          

           MERCUTIO
           Farewell, ancient lady. Farewell.

          
          The car pulls away.

          

          EXT. STREET. DAY.


          
          The limousine drives through Verona Beach.

          

          INT. MOVING LIMOUSINE. DAY.


          
          CLOSE ON: Romeo jammed into the corner of the seat. The
          Nurse's face is pressed alarmingly close to his. She speaks
          in cold deadly earnest.

          

           NURSE
           If ye should lead her in a fool's
           paradise, as they say, it were a
           very gross kind of behavior, as
           they say. For the gentlewoman is
           young; and therefore, if you should
           deal double with her, truly it were
           an ill thing and very weak dealing.

          
          BEAT: Romeo chooses his words carefully.

          

           ROMEO
           Bid her to come to confession this
           afternoon,
           And there she shall at Friar
           Laurence's cell
           Be shrived and
           (PUSH IN ON: Romeo)
           married.

          

          INT. JULIET'S BEDROOM. DAY.


          
          CLOSE ON: Juliet's face peering out her bedroom window.

          

           JULIET
           O God she comes!

          

          EXT. CAPULETS MANSION - DRIVEWAY. DAY.


          
          PULL BACK: JULIET'S P.O.V.: The limousine pulls up at the
          front door, the Nurse alights.

          
          Juliet bolts from the room.

          

          INT. LANDING. DAY.


          
          Juliet hurries down the stairs - the Nurse, a way ahead,
          disappears into a doorway.

          

          INT. STAIRWAY. DAY.


          
          Juliet races down a dark stairwell that leads to the bowels
          of the house.

          

          INT. KITCHEN. DAY.


          
          The kitchen, obviously the Nurse's domain, is decorated with
          a mixture of religious iconography and travel posters. Most
          of the posters depict a strange city of decadent, decaying,
          beauty.

          
          Juliet bursts breathlessly into the room.

          

           JULIET
           O honey nurse, what news?

          
          The Nurse, buried up to her ample hips inside the
          refrigerator, does not turn around.

          
          Juliet cries impatiently.

          

           JULIET
           Nurse!

          
          The nurse emerges from the ice box laden with food. Moving
          to the counter she starts to make a sandwich.

          

           NURSE
           I am aweary, give me leave awhile.
           Fie, how my bones ache. What a
           jaunce have I.

          
          Juliet under her breath.

          

           JULIET
           I would thou hadst my bones and I
           thy news.

          
          Juliet goes to the nurse.

          

           JULIET
           Nay come, I pray thee, speak: good;

           GOOD
           Nurse, speak.

          
          Sandwich made, the nurse shuffles over to a corner couch.

          

           NURSE
           Jesu, what haste. Can you not stay
           awhile?
           Can you not see I am out of breath?

          
          Juliet cannot stand the suspense any longer.

          

           JULIET
           How art thou out of breath when
           thou hast breath
           To say to me that thou art out of
           breath!
           Is the news good or bad? Answer to
           that.

          
          The Nurse takes a big bite from her sandwich and answers
          through thoughtful chews.

          

           NURSE
           Well, you have made a simple
           choice.
           You know not how to choose a man.
           Romeo? No, not he.
           Though his face be better than any
           man's, yet his leg excels all men's
           and for a hand and a foot and a
           body, though they be not to be
           talked on, yet they are past
           compare.
           He's not the flower of courtesy,
           but I'll warrant him as gentle as a
           lamb. Go thy ways, wench, serve
           God. What, have you dined at home?

          
          Juliet is flabbergasted.

          

           JULIET
           No, no. But all this I did know
           before. What says he of our
           marriage? What of that

          

           NURSE
           Lord how my head aches! What a
           head have I:
           My back -

          
          This is a game that Juliet knows well. She moves behind the
          Nurse and begins massaging her back.

          

           NURSE (CONT.)
           o' t'other side - ah, my back!
           Beshrew your heart for sending me

           ABOUT
           To catch my death with jauncing up
           and down.

          
          With sublime self control, Juliet coo's sweetly.

          

           JULIET
           I'faith I am sorry that thou art
           not well.
           Sweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me,
           what says my love?

          

           NURSE
           Your love says like an honest
           gentleman,
           And a courteous, and a kind, and a
           handsome,
           And I warrant a virtuous - Where is
           your mother?

          
          Juliet cracks.

          

           JULIET
           Where is my mother? How oddly thou
           repliest!
           'Your love says, like an honest
           gentleman, "Where is your mother"'!

          
          The nurse sulks.

          

           NURSE
           O God's lady dear are you so hot?
           Henceforth do your messages yourself.

          
          Juliet's frustration explodes.

          

           JULIET
           Here's such a coil! COME WHAT SAYS

           ROMEO?

          
          PAUSE: The Nurse considers Juliet.

          

           NURSE
           Have you got leave to go to
           confession today?

          

           JULIET
           I have.

          

           NURSE
           Then hie you hence to Father
           Laurence cell.
           There stays a husband to make you a
           wife!

          
          Juliet, with a scream of joy, hugs the Nurse to her.

          
          HOLD ON: Juliet's ecstatic features.

          

          INT. CHURCH. DAY.


          

          TIGHT ON: FATHER LAURENCE:

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           These violent delights have violent
           ends!

          
          PULL BACK: Father Laurence is preaching energetically from
          the pulpit. Hidden from the congregation, Romeo waits in a
          small alcove chapel at the side of the altar.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)
           The sweetest honey
           Is loathsome in its own
           deliciousness,
           Therefore love moderately.

          
          The Father glances toward Romeo.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)
           Long love doth so.
           Too swift arrives as tardy as too
           slow.
          Juliet pushes through the double doors at the far end of the
          church.

          
          Father Laurence motions to the middle-aged choir master who
          leads the choir into a choral version of Led Zeppelin's "A
          Whole Lot of Love" with Latin lyrics.

          
          Father Laurence hurries from the altar over to Romeo.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)
           Here comes the lady.

          
          Juliet bursts into the tiny chapel. Trying to observe a
          vestige of decorum, she greets Father Laurence.

          

           JULIET
           Good afternoon to my ghostly
           confessor.

          
          But before the priest can reply, the two lovers embrace,
          kissing passionately.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE

           (DRYLY)
           Romeo shall thank thee, daughter,
           for us both.

          
          The choir completes the hymn and the priest, realising it is
          his cue, rushes back to the altar. He quickly delivers a
          prayer to the congregation while eyeing the increasingly
          amorous smooching of the young couple.

          
          The choir launch into a joyous chorus and the priest returns
          to Romeo and Juliet. He delicately parts the couple.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)
           Come, come, and we will make short
           work.
           For, by your leaves, you shall not
           stay alone
           Till Holy Church incorporate two in
           one.

          
          A young boy with a voice like Jamiroquai steps forward. He
          launches into a wailing solo.

          
          MACRO CLOSE UP: A simple silver ring. Engraved on the
          inside of the band are the words 'I love thee.'

          
          PULL BACK: Romeo slips the ring onto Juliet's finger as the
          priest executes the formal sacrament of marriage.

          INT./EXT. CHURCH. DAY.


          
          CRANE UP: Through the majestic patterning of stained glass,
          and out of the church to find Peter, the chauffeur, cradling
          a small camera as he waits nervously beside the limo.

          

          EXT. CHURCH. DAY.


          
          The music swells in celebration. Romeo and Juliet, now
          newly-wed, rush from the side door of the church. The
          priest follows, throwing handfuls of rice. Peter studiously
          takes a snap as the bride and groom kiss.

          
          Peter holds the door of the limousine open. Reluctantly
          Juliet gets into the car.

          
          As the car pulls out of the driveway, Romeo runs alongside.

          
          HOLD: On Romeo as he watches the big black car speed away.

          

          EXT. UNDERWATER. DAY.


          
          FISH-EYE VIEW: From the bottom of the ocean; Mercutio's
          distorted features. Gun aimed, he stares intently into the
          water.

          
          A muffled BANG! and a bullet whizzes past the camera.

          

          EXT. VERONA BEACH. DAY.


          
          We see that Mercutio - wading in knee deep water close to
          the beach - is hunting fish.

          
          Benvolio shelters in the shade of an unmanned life guard
          tower.

          
          A shimmering heat haze blankets the deserted beach and the
          horizon is stacked with purple storm clouds.

          

           BENVOLIO
           I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's
           retire.
           The day is hot,

          
          Mercutio, ignoring him, plugs away at another fish. Benvolio
          nervously looks to see if there is any reaction to the sound
          of the shot.

          

           BENVOLIO (CONT.)
           The Capels are abroad. And if we
           meet we shall not 'scape a brawl.

          
          Mercutio strides out of the water.

          

           MERCUTIO
           Thou art like one of these fellows
           that, when he enters the confines
           of a tavern, claps me his sword
           upon the table and says 'God send
           me no need of thee!'
           (he hands Benvolio
           his gun)
           and by the operation of the second
           cup draws him on the drawer, when
           indeed there is no need.

          
          Another incredible sleight of hand routine and Mercutio has
          managed to draw Benvolio's pistol, retrieve his own gun, and
          trap Benvolio with a barrel at each temple.

          
          The joke has worn thin for Benvolio; he pushes past Mercutio
          toward where Balthasar, Sampson and Gregory lounge in the
          shade of the beach-side hang.

          
          Suddenly he stops dead - a monstrous black sedan prowls into
          the beach side parking lot.

          

           BENVOLIO
           By my head, here comes the Capulets.

          

           MERCUTIO
           By my heel, I care not.

          

          EXT. BEACH - PARKING LOT. DAY.


          
          The sedan mounts the curb and slides to a halt only metres
          from Benvolio and Mercutio.

          
          Tybalt, Abra and Petruchio alight from the sedan and walk
          menacingly toward Mercutio and Benvolio.

          

           TYBALT
           Gentlemen, good day. A word with
           one of you.

          
          The boys from the hang, drawn the Capulet car, converge -
          eyes dart nervously, hands stray towards guns.

          
          Mercutio smiles mockingly.

          

           MERCUTIO
           And but one word with one of us?
           Couple it with something. Make it
           a word and a...

          
          Leaning close to Tybalt, he camps the implication.

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)
           ...blow.

          
          Mercutio scores. The boys laugh.

          

           TYBALT

           (FURIOUS)
           You shall find me apt enough to
           that, sir,
           (clutching at his
           side arm)
           And you will give me occasion.

          
          CLOSE ON: Mercutio. He stops, eyeing the hand on the gun.
          No one moves.

          

           MERCUTIO
           (a breathy, coquettish

           VOICE)
           Could you not take some occasion
           without giving?

          
          The boys fall about again. Tybalt cracks.

          

           TYBALT
           Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.

          
          The accusation stings - Mercutio's anger flares.

          

           MERCUTIO
           Consort? What, dost thou make us
           minstrels? And thou make minstrels
           of us look to hear nothing but
           discords. Here's my fiddlestick.

          
          Indicating his holstered gun.

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)
           Here's that shall make you dance.
           (barking at Tybalt)
           Zounds,
           (goading him to go
           for his gun)
           consort!

          
          CLOSE ON: Tybalt.

          
          CLOSE ON: Mercutio. He will not back down. Benvolio tries
          to diffuse things.

          

           BENVOLIO
           Either withdraw unto some private
           place.
           Or reason coldly of your grievances.
           Here all eyes gaze on us.

          

           MERCUTIO
           Men's eyes were made to look, and
           let them gaze.
           I will not budge for no man's
           pleasure, I.

          
          At that moment, Romeo's car pulls into the lot. Tybalt
          smiles.

          

           TYBALT
           Well sir, here comes my man.

          
          Tybalt moves toward Romeo who bounds from his car full of
          happy news.

          

           TYBALT
           Romeo, the love I bear thee can

           AFFORD
           No better term than this:

          
          CLOSE ON: Tybalt. He clears his jacket from his side arm
          and issues the challenge.

          

           TYBALT (CONT.)
           Thou art a villain!

          
          CLOSE ON: Mercutio.

          
          CLOSE ON: Benvolio.

          
          All eyes are on Romeo.

          
          Romeo calmly approaches his now cousin.

          

           ROMEO
           Tybalt, the reason that I have to
           love thee
           Doth much excuse the appertaining

           RAGE
           To such a greeting: villain am I
           none,
           Therefore farewell. I see thou
           knowest me not.

          
          Romeo turns, and to the amazement of all, walks back to his
          car. Tybalt, unable to shoot him in the back, is confused.
          He hurls himself into his sedan.

          
          Kicking it into a sand spraying U-turn, he careens the short
          distance to Romeo's car. Slamming into the back of it he
          blocks Romeo in.

          
          Tybalt leaps out, maniacally kicking at bumper, door and
          headlights. Romeo flicks the locks down. Tybalt shatters
          the side window and hauls Romeo through the door, slamming
          him against the savaged fuselage.

          

           TYBALT
           Boy, this shall not excuse the

           INJURIES
           That thou hast done me!

          
          He smashes Romeo across the face, Romeo crashes to the
          roadway.

          

           TYBALT

           (YELLING)
           Turn and draw.

          
          A cut has opened in the side of Romeo's mouth. He unsteadily
          lifts himself up, and meeting Tybalt's gaze, speaks through
          bloodied teeth.

          

           ROMEO
           I never injured thee,
           And so, good Capulet, which name I

           TENDER
           As dearly as mine own...

          
          Romeo cautiously extracts his gun...

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           ...be satisfied.

          
          ...and throws it at Tybalt's feet.

          
          Storm clouds obscure the sun as Romeo turns and walks from
          the parking lot.

          
          Mercutio, Benvolio and the others cannot believe their eyes.

          

           MERCUTIO
           O calm, dishonourable, vile
           submission!

          

          EXT. BEACH - VACANT LOT. DAY.


          
          Tybalt's anger must be answered. He ceremoniously disarms,
          gives his weapon to Abra, and sprints after Romeo who is now
          passing a beach side lot that houses an abandoned grand
          hotel. A bone-cracking kick sends Romeo crumbling into the
          vacant lot. The boys swarm toward the fray.
          Romeo, still refusing the fight, scrambles up the stairs of
          the deserted hotel. Tybalt trips him and Romeo careens into
          an ornamental wooden railing, smashing it to pieces.

          
          Tybalt kicks savagely at the helpless Romeo.

          
          Suddenly, Mercutio appears running full tilt down the
          concrete terrace. He plucks up one of the splintered wooden
          palings and yells...

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)
           Tybalt, you ratcatcher,

          
          ...as he bludgeons him across the face. Tybalt goes down.

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)
           Will you walk?

          
          Tybalt leaps to his feet grabbing a lump of wood.

          

           TYBALT
           What wouldst thou have with me?

          
          He swipes at Mercutio.

          

           MERCUTIO

           (AVOIDING)
           Good King of Cats, nothing but one
           of your nine lives.

          
          Mercutio jabs, Tybalt sidesteps.

          

           TYBALT
           I am for you.

          
          Tybalt aims a double-handed blow to Mercutio's head.
          Mercutio blocks, hooking Tybalt's stick away.

          
          Unarmed, Tybalt throws his full body weight upon Mercutio,
          slamming him against a window that shatters in a storm of
          glass.

          
          Lightning fast, Mercutio jackknifes to his feet. He raises
          his weapon to deliver a skull-crushing final blow to the
          trapped Tybalt. Romeo rushes between them.

          

           ROMEO
           Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio!

          
          Seizing the opportunity, Tybalt lunges at Romeo with a
          lethal triangle of broken glass. He misses, gouging instead
          a slash of flesh from Mercutio's stomach.
          A scream of excruciating pain as Mercutio grabs at his
          bloodied side. Everyone is still. In the abrupt silence,
          sirens are heard closing in the distance. Abra tugs at
          Tybalt.

          

           ABRA
           Away Tybalt!

          
          They bolt for their vehicle.

          
          Benvolio goes to Mercutio.

          

           BENVOLIO
           Art thou hurt?

          
          But Mercutio, covering his wound with his hand, laughs.

          

           MERCUTIO
           Ay, ay, a scratch.

          
          He turns to his assembled fans at the bottom of the stairs.
          With outrageous bravado he plays at being Caesar the
          conqueror.

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)
           A scratch!

          
          The boys cheer their conquering hero. Romeo helps Mercutio
          down the stairs.

          

           ROMEO
           Courage, man. The hurt cannot be
           much.

          
          Mercutio holding his bleeding side, jokes through the pain.

          

           MERCUTIO
           'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow
           and you shall find me a grave man.

          
          He turns the next thought to the assembled audience.

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)
           (through crazy laughter)
           A plague o' both your houses!

          
          Mercutio turns from the cheering boys to Romeo who is
          struggling to support his weight.

          
          Mercutio - through weak and desperate breathing.

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)
           Why the devil came you between us?
           I was hurt under your arm.
          Romeo starts to register the panic in Mercutio's eyes.

          

           ROMEO
           I thought all for the best.

          
          Like an animal trying to break free from a mortal trap,
          Mercutio pushes Romeo away. He screams in horror, as if
          falling in the dark:

          

           MERCUTIO
           A plague o' both your houses!
           They have made worms' meat of me.

          
          Mercutio staggers down the stairs and collapses in the dirt.
          Romeo is there instantly, cradling his friend's head out of
          the dust. The dying boy stares back at Romeo, smiling
          through the chilling cold.

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)
           (a silent whisper)
           Your houses!

          
          Everything stands still, everything is quiet. The storm
          finally breaks.

          

          EXT. BEACH - RAIN. DAY.


          
          Tiny drops of water fall from the sky and bespeckle
          Mercutio's lifeless body. The droplets grow to a heavy rain.
          Romeo can hear the faint sound a thousand miles away of
          Benvolio whispering:

          

           BENVOLIO
           Mercutio is dead!

          
          Tears streak Romeo's face. He cries out.

          

           ROMEO
           Oh sweet Juliet,
           Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
           And in my temper softened valor's
           steel!

          
          The sound of Tybalt's vehicle starting brings back cold
          reality. Romeo's sorrow turns to uncontrollable rage.

          
          Shrugging aside Benvolio's attempts to restrain him, Romeo
          runs to his car.

          

          EXT. BEACH - PARKING LOT. DAY.


          
          Up ahead Tybalt's sedan screeches into a fishtailing U-turn
          and powers away.
          Romeo jumps into his vehicle. In an effort to head Tybalt
          off, he guns his damaged machine down a one way street.

          
          The rain is now blinding. Romeo stops for nothing;
          pedestrians flee, cars spin out of control.

          

          EXT. VERONA BEACH STREETS - FROM AIR. DAY.


          
          AERIAL SHOT: The two cars speed along parallel roads toward
          Plaza Jesu. Romeo is gaining.

          

          EXT. VERONA STREET - CHRIST ROUNDABOUT. DAY.


          
          CUT TO: Tybalt's car negotiating the immense roundabout at
          the foot of the statue of Jesus.

          

          EXT. CHRIST ROUNDABOUT. DAY.


          
          CUT TO: Romeo's car firing out of the one way street and
          slamming into Tybalt's car. Tybalt's car careens out of
          control up the stairs of the statue, clips the fountain,
          flips, and slides upside down onto the roadway.

          
          CUT TO: Tybalt scrambling from his upturned vehicle.

          
          CUT TO: Romeo running toward him.

          
          SUDDENLY Romeo is halted by Tybalt's drawn gun. Fearlessly
          marching toward it, he screams through tears.

          

           ROMEO
           Mercutio's soul
           Is but a little way above our heads,

          
          Romeo grabs the barrel of the gun; forcing it between his
          own eyes, he growls insanely at Tybalt.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           Staying for thine to keep him
           company.

          
          Tybalt, unnerved, tries to back off.

          

           TYBALT
           Thou, wretched boy, shalt with him
           hence.

          
          Romeo, refusing to let go of the gun, forces Tybalt backward
          through the torrential rain.

          

           ROMEO
           (with frightening intensity)
           Either thou or I, or both, must go
           with him.

          
          Cars swerve, Romeo is relentless. He grips Tybalt's hand
          trying to force him to shoot.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           Either thou or I, or both, must go
           with him.

          
          Panicked, Tybalt wrenches free and lurches onto the roadway.
          Blinded by the headlights of an oncoming car he thuds onto
          its hood as it skids to a halt. The impact catapults his
          gun high into the air.

          
          Romeo coldly follows its slow motion, spinning trajectory.

          
          Real time stretches as the gun dances high above his head.
          Police sirens, cars swerving, people screaming, and the
          yelling of panicked commands fade to a nothingness.

          
          Romeo stands calmly considering the gun in the air. A
          harrowing symphonic tone and the echo of Mercutio's voice
          can be heard.

          

           MERCUTIO (V/O)
           Why the devil came you between us?

          
          CUT TO: Patrol cars sliding to a halt.

          
          CUT TO: The spinning gun slowly falling to earth.

          
          CUT TO: Tybalt rising from the ground.

          
          CUT TO: Cops leaping from their cars.

          
          CUT TO: The gun landing in Romeo's hand. His eyes full of
          rage.

          
          CUT TO: Cops levelling their revolvers.

          

           COP
           (Romeo in his sights)
           Put up thy weapon.

          
          CUT TO: Real time - Romeo fires three deliberate shots.
          Tybalt's body convulses backwards against the car, hitting
          it with a thud, bloodying the shattered windscreen.

          
          The cop fires. A bullet grazes Romeo's arm - his gun drops
          as he screams.

          

           ROMEO
           O, I am fortune's fool!

          
          At that moment a roaring hurricane wind hits; blinding police.

          
          CLOSE ON: The scaffolding surrounding the Jesus statue.
          Part of it's canvas covering rips away. Scaffold rains down
          as the insanely flapping material tries to smash free from
          it's moorings.

          
          Through the mayhem, a rusty Ford driven by Balthasar, slides
          to a halt.

          
          Balthasar screams out at Romeo.

          

           BALTHASAR
           Romeo, away be gone! Stand not
           amazed!

          
          Romeo collapses into the front seat.

          
          The cops open fire as Balthasar speeds off into the storm.

          

          INT. BALTHASAR'S CAR. AFTERNOON.


          
          Romeo is bleeding from the bullet graze.

          

          EXT. CAUSEWAY. AFTERNOON.


          
          The gale-force winds throw waves across the causeway as the
          fugitives disappear into the black afternoon.

          
          CRANE UP: In the distance we see Montague and Capulet towers.
          Divided by the statue of Christ, they suffer the storm's rage.

          

          EXT. MONUMENT. AFTERNOON.


          
          Away, below the outstretched arms of Christ, lights from
          emergency vehicles pulse red through the downpour.

          
          THE CAMERA: Falls through heavy rain toward a woman crouched
          over the lifeless body of Tybalt.

          
          She cries:

          

           GLORIA
           Tybalt!

          
          Cops nervously eye Fulgencio Capulet and Ted Montague, who,
          both flanked by body guards, face each other across the
          crime scene. Medics stand by helplessly as Gloria clings to
          Tybalt's body. A handcuffed Benvolio looks on.

          

           GLORIA (CONT.)
           Tybalt, my cousin, O my brother's
           child!
           O, the blood is spilled of my dear
           kinsman.

          
          Police lines part as Captain Prince arrives.

          

           CAPTAIN PRINCE
           Where are the vile beginners of
           this fray?

          
          Benvolio struggles forward.

          

           BENVOLIO
           O noble Prince I can discover all
           The unlucky manage of this fatal
           brawl.

          
          Gloria appeals hysterically:

          

           GLORIA
           Prince as thou art true,
           For blood of ours shed blood of
           Montague!

          

           CAPTAIN PRINCE
           Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?

          

           BENVOLIO
           (pointing to Tybalt's corpse)
           There lies the man, slain by young
           Romeo,
           That slew thy kinsman brave Mercutio.

          
          Gloria interjects savagely.

          

           GLORIA
           He speaks not true! Affection
           makes him false!

          

           BENVOLIO
           Romeo, that spoke him fair, could
           not take
           Truce with the unruly spleen of

           TYBALT
           Deaf to peace!

          

           GLORIA
           He is a kinsman to the Montague!
           I beg for justice which thou Prince
           must give.
           Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not
           live!

          
          Captain Prince turns to Gloria.

           CAPTAIN PRINCE
           Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio.
           Who now the price of his dear blood
           doth owe?

          
          Ted Montague pleads:

          

           MONTAGUE
           Not Romeo, Prince, he was Mercutio's
           friend; His fault concludes but
           what the law should end,
           The life of Tybalt.

          
          Captain Prince eyes Montague coldly.

          

           CAPTAIN PRINCE
           And for that offence
           Immediately we do exile him.

          
          Montague, body guards in tow, surges forward.

          

           MONTAGUE
           Noble Prince...?

          
          Prince silences him.

          

           CAPTAIN PRINCE
           I will be deaf to pleading and

           EXCUSES;
           Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase
           out abuses.
           Therefore use none.

          
          The Captain turns and addresses his assembled officers.

          

           CAPTAIN PRINCE (CONT.)
           Let Romeo hence in haste,
           Else, when he is found that hour is
           his last.

          
          CLOSE ON: Captain Prince.

          

           CAPTAIN PRINCE (CONT.)
           Bear hence this body and attend our
           will.
           Mercy but murders, pardoning those
           that kill.

          

          INT. JULIET'S BEDROOM. AFTERNOON.


          
          An acoustic guitar version of Joy Division's 'Love Will Tear
          Us Apart.' Juliet traces the path of a raindrop on the
          window pane as she speaks her thoughts to the storm.

          

           JULIET
           Come gentle night, coming loving
           black browed night,
           Give me my Romeo. And when I shall
           die,
           Take him and cut him out in little
           stars,
           And he will make the face of heaven
           so fine
           That all the world will be in love
           with night,
           And pay no worship to the garish
           sun.
           O, I have bought the mansion of a

           LOVE
           But not possessed it, and though I
           am sold,
           Not yet enjoyed. So tedious is
           this day
           As is the night before some festival
           To an impatient child that hath new

           ROBES
           And may not wear them.

          

          EXT. CAPULET'S MANSION - DRIVEWAY. AFTERNOON.


          
          Juliet's P.O.V.: The limousine pulls into the driveway.

          
          PULL OUT: Of the window and CRANE DOWN: Juliet runs from the
          room.

          

          EXT. CAPULET MANSION. AFTERNOON.


          
          Through the open doorway we see an excited Juliet meet the
          Nurse at the bottom of the stairs.

          
          The music surges.

          
          TRACK IN: The Nurse's words are lost in the storm.

          
          Juliet buckles.

          

          INT. CAPULET MANSION. AFTERNOON.


          
          We are close enough now to hear Juliet's words.

          

           JULIET
           Oh God! Did Romeo's hand shed
           Tybalt's blood?

          

           NURSE
           It did, it did! Alas the day, it
           did!

          

           JULIET
           Oh serpent heart, hid with a
           flowering face.
           Was ever book containing such vile

           MATTER
           So fairly bound? O, that deceit
           should dwell
           In such a gorgeous palace!

          

           NURSE
           There's no trust, No faith, no
           honesty in men. All perjured,
           All forsworn, all naught, all
           dissemblers.
           Shame come to Romeo.

          

           JULIET
           Blistered be thy tongue
           For such a wish! He was not born
           to shame. Upon his brow shame is
           ashamed to sit.

          

           NURSE
           Will you speak well of him that
           killed your cousin?

          

           JULIET
           Shall I speak ill of him that is my
           husband?
           Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall
           smooth thy name
           When I, thy three-hours wife have
           mangled it?
           But whyfore, villain, didst thou
           kill my cousin?
           That villain cousin would have
           killed my husband.
           All this is comfort, wherefore weep
           I then?
           Some word there was worser than
           Tybalt's death:
           I would forget it fain - exiled.
           Tybalt is dead, and Romeo exiled.
           To speak that word is father,
           mother,
           Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet, all slain,
           All dead.

          
          Juliet sinks to the floor, overwhelmed by tears.

          

           JULIET (CONT.)
           Nurse, I'll to my wedding bed,
           And death, not Romeo, take my
           maidenhead.

          
          Nurse looks down at Juliet. She goes and comforts her.

          

           NURSE
           Hie to your chamber. I'll find

           ROMEO
           To comfort you. I know well where
           he is.
           Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at
           night.

          
          Juliet looks up through tears.

          

           JULIET
           O find him, give this ring to my
           true knight,
           And bid him come to take his last
           farewell.

          
          SLAM MACRO ZOOM: Into the ring. The screen fills with the
          words 'I love thee'.

          

          INT. PRESBYTERY BEDROOM. NIGHT.


          
          Romeo lies on the bed shirtless and crying. His wound has
          been bandaged and Balthasar crouches frightened in the corner.

          
          The priest leads the Nurse into the room.

          
          Romeo looks up.

          

           ROMEO
           Nurse!

          
          She goes to him.

          

           NURSE
           Ah sir! Ah sir! Death's the end
           of all.

          

           ROMEO
           Speakest thou of Juliet?
           Where is she? And how doth she?
           And what says
           My concealed lady to our cancelled
           love?

          

           NURSE
           O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps
           and weeps,
           And then on Romeo cries, and then
           falls down again.

          
          Romeo is wailing inconsolably.

           ROMEO
           As if that name,
           Shot from the deadly level of a
           gun,
           Did murder her, as that name's
           cursed hand murdered her kinsman!

          
          Father Laurence shakes the hysterical boy.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           I thought thy disposition better
           tempered!
           Thy Juliet is alive, There art thou
           happy.
           The law that threatened death
           becomes thy friend
           And turns it to exile. There art
           thou happy.
           A pack of blessings light upon thy
           back.

          
          Romeo calms. The Nurse gives him the ring.

          

           NURSE
           Here sir, a ring my lady bid me
           give you.

          
          Romeo enfolds the ring in his hand.

          

           ROMEO
           How well my comfort is revived by
           this.

          
          The priest goes to his wardrobe, removes a clean white shirt
          and helps Romeo put it on.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           Go, get thee to thy love, as was
           decreed.
           Ascend her chamber. Hence and
           comfort her.
           But look thou stay not till the
           Watch be set,
           For then thou canst not pass to
           Mantua where thou shalt live till
           we can find a time
           To blaze your marriage, reconcile
           your friends,
           Beg pardon of the Prince and call
           thee back,
           With twenty hundred thousand times
           more joy
           Than thou wentst forth in
           lamentation.

          
          Father Laurence ushers Romeo from the room.

          

          INT. HALLWAY. NIGHT.


          
          They hurry down the hallway.

          
          The priest opens the front door.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           Go hence. Be gone by the break of

           DAY
           Sojourn in Mantua. Give me thy hand.

          
          Romeo embraces him.

          

           ROMEO
           Farewell.

          
          The priest and Balthasar watch as Romeo and the Nurse sprint
          for the car.

          

          INT. CAPULET MANSION. NIGHT.


          
          Sobs echo through the house.

          
          Dave Paris stands in the entrance hallway clutching a huge
          bunch of flowers.

          
          Fulgencio Capulet stands beside him, whisky glass in hand.

          
          CUT TO: Gloria on the upper landing. There is a strange
          faraway quality about her as she descends to Dave and Capulet.

          

           GLORIA
           She'll not come down tonight.

          
          Dave, an understanding smile.

          

           DAVE
           These times of woe afford no times
           to woo.

          
          Capulet guides Dave into the house.

          

           CAPULET
           Look you, she loved her kinsman
           Tybalt dearly.

          

           GLORIA

           (JOINING)
           And so did I.

          

           CAPULET
           (a cold glance at Gloria)
           Well, we were born to die.

          
          Capulet takes a large slug of whisky. Gloria leans close to
          Dave.

          

           GLORIA
           I'll know her mind early tomorrow.
           Tonight she's mewed up to her
           heaviness.

          
          As Gloria, Dave and Capulet exit down the hallway we CRANE
          UP: toward Juliet's bedroom door.

          

          INT. JULIET'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.


          
          CLOSE ON: Juliet's face. Tears stream onto the pillow.
          Without warning a hand lightly touches her cheek. Juliet's
          eyes dart up to discover Romeo standing above her.

          
          A still moment of disbelief. Leaning down, Roemo kisses
          away the tears that fall from her dark, wide eyes.

          
          Juliet's lips find Romeo's and they gently sink back onto
          the bed.

          

          INT. SITTING ROOM. NIGHT.


          
          Capulet sits in an armchair drinking. Dave and Gloria sit
          opposite as Capulet whips himself into a frenzy of drunken
          excitement.

          

           CAPULET
           We'll keep no great ado - a friend
           or two.
           For, hark you, Tybalt being slain
           so late,
           It may be thought we held him
           carelessly,
           Being our kinsman if we revel
           much -
           But soft what day is this?

          

           DAVE
           Monday my lord.

          

           CAPULET
           Well Wednesday is too soon - what
           say you to Thursday?

          
          Gloria looks up alarmed; Dave is stunned.

          

           DAVE
           My lord I...

          

           CAPULET
           (leaning close)
           I will make a desperate tender of
           my child's love.
           (a drunken good humour)
           I think she will be ruled in all
           respects by me;
           (exploding with
           hearty laughter)
           Nay, more, I doubt it not!

          
          CUT TO: Gloria, her face hardens.

          

           CAPULET
           (to Dave)
           But what say you to Thursday?

          
          Dave is trying to catch up.

          

           DAVE
           My lord I...

          
          CUT TO: Capulet he eyes Dave intently.

          

           DAVE (CONT.)
           I would that Thursday were tomorrow.

          
          Delighted, Capulet jumps to his feet.

          

           CAPULET
           A Thursday let it be then!

          
          Capulet holds out his glass in toast. Dave and Gloria rise.

          

           CAPULET
           Wife, go you to Juliet ere you go
           to bed.
           Tell her, a Thursday she shall be

           MARRIED
           To this noble sir!

          
          CLOSE ON: The glasses clink.

          

          EXT. CAPULET ESTATE. DAWN.


          
          A pink and gold dawn breaks over Capulet Mansion.

          

          INT. JULIET'S BEDROOM. DAWN.


          
          A tangle of young limbs.

          
          Romeo and Juliet blissfully asleep. The dawn light creeps
          into the room.

          

          EXT. CAPULET ESTATE. DAWN.


          
          Balthasar's car covertly pulls into a side road near the
          estate.

          

          INT. JULIET'S BEDROOM. DAWN.


          
          Romeo and Juliet still asleep.

          
          CRANE DOWN: Toward the sleeping innocence of the faces.

          
          HOLD: A shadow of fear passes across Romeo's features.

          
          With a cry of panic, he sits bolt upright.

          
          Wide awake, but disorientated, Romeo stares around the
          room - as Juliet stirs, he remembers where he is.

          
          Slipping quietly from the bed, Romeo begins to dress.

          
          CLOSE ON: Romeo. A pair of lips enter frame and find his
          neck. It is Juliet. She hugs herself to him.

          

           JULIET
           Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet
           near day.

          
          Romeo turns - softly he strokes her cheek.

          

           ROMEO
           I must be gone and live, or stay
           and die.

          
          Juliet kisses his finger-tips.

          

           JULIET
           Yond light is not daylight,

          
          And then his cheek...

          

           JULIET (CONT.)
           I know it, I
           It is some meteor that the sun

           EXHALES
           To light thee on thy way to Mantua.
           Therefore stay yet. Thou needest
           not to be gone.

          
          Romeo, feverishly returning the kisses, throws himself on
          Juliet.

          

           ROMEO
           Let me be taken, let me be put to
           death.
           I have more care to stay than will
           to go.
           Come, death, and welcome! Juliet
           wills it so.

          
          Juliet is suddenly still. Romeo kisses her gently.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           How is't, my soul? Let's talk. It
           is not day.

          
          Juliet pulls Romeo to his feet.

          

           JULIET
           It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone,
           away!
           O, now be gone! More light and
           light it grows.

          
          Frantically she helps him into his clothes.

          

           ROMEO
           More light and light: more dark and
           dark our woes.

          
          There is an urgent knocking on the door. They freeze.

          

           NURSE (O/S)
           Madam!

          

           JULIET
           Nurse!

          

           NURSE (O/S)
           Your lady mother is coming to your
           chamber.

          

           JULIET
           Then, window, let day in, and let
           life out.

          
          Desperately Juliet pulls Romeo out onto the balcony.

          

          EXT. BALCONY. DAWN.


          
          The storm, now past, has left a morning achingly pure.

          

           ROMEO
           Farewell, farewell. One kiss, and
           I'll descend.
          Romeo climbs down from the balcony and into the shadows.

          

           JULIET
           O, think'st thou we shall ever meet
           again?

          
          Romeo smiles up at her.

          

           ROMEO
           I doubt it not;

          
          Juliet's face darkens.

          

           JULIET
           O God, I have an ill-divining soul.
           Methinks I see thee, now thou art
           so low,
           As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.

          
          Romeo scrambles back up to the balcony.

          

           ROMEO
           Trust me, love, all these woes
           shall serve
           For sweet discourses in our times
           to come.

          
          From Juliet's bedroom comes the brittle sound of Gloria
          Capulet's voice.

          

           GLORIA
           Ho daughter! Are you up?

          
          Juliet spins around. Gloria has parted the curtains and is
          staring directly at her daughter.

          

           GLORIA
           Well, well.

          
          CUT TO: Romeo sheltered just below the lip of the balcony.

          
          FOLLOW: His hand, as it slowly reaches up and touches
          Juliet's fingers hidden behind her back.

          
          Gloria returns to the room. Juliet steals a glance toward
          Romeo as he silently mouths:

          

           ROMEO
           Adieu, adieu!

          
          As Romeo's face disappears into the shadows Juliet whispers
          a little prayer to herself.

          

           JULIET
           O Fortune, Fortune! Be fickle,
           Fortune,
           Fo then I hope thou wilt not keep
           him long
           But send him back.

          

          INT. JULIET'S BEDROOM. DAWN.


          
          Juliet is trying not to cry as she goes in to her mother.
          Gloria turns to her.

          

           GLORIA
           Thou hast a careful father, child:
           One who, to put thee from thy
           heaviness,
           Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy
           That thou expects not nor I looked
           not for.

          
          Juliet plays along.

          

           JULIET
           Madam, in happy time. What day is
           that?

          
          Gloria takes a deep breath.

          

           GLORIA
           Marry, my child, early next Thursday

           MORN
           The gallant, young, and noble
           gentleman,
           Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
           Shall happily make thee there a
           joyful bride.

          
          CLOSE ON: Juliet. She can barely speak.

          

           JULIET
           Now by Saint Peter's Church, and
           Peter too,
           He shall not make me there a joyful
           bride!

          
          Fear passes across Gloria's face.

          

           GLORIA
           Here comes your father. Tell him
           so yourself.

          
          Capulet - whisky glass in hand - ebulliently bursts into the
          room.

          

           CAPULET
           How now, wife?
           Have you delivered to her our decree?

          

           GLORIA
           Ay, sir. But she will none, she
           gives you thanks.
           I would the fool were married to
           her grave!

          
          Capulet - a dangerous calm.

          

           CAPULET
           How? Will she none?
           Is she not proud? Doth she not
           count her blest,
           Unworthy as she is, that we have

           WROUGHT
           So worthy a gentleman to be her
           bride?

          

           JULIET
           Not proud you have, but thankful
           that you have.
           Proud can I never be of what I hate.

          
          PAUSE: Capulet considers his daughter, then -

          
          BAM! He hurls his glass against the wall, shattering it
          into a thousand pieces.

          

           CAPULET
           Thank me no thankings, nor proud me
           no prouds,
           But fettle your fine joints 'gainst
           Thursday next ...

          
          Capulet advances. Juliet, terrified, retreats into the
          hallway.

          

           JULIET
           Hear me with patience but to speak
           a word...

          

          INT. LANDING. DAY.


          
          The Nurse appears as Capulet picks his daughter up and
          shakes her like a rag doll.

          

           CAPULET
           Speak not, reply not, do not answer
           me!

          
          He throws her to the floor. His fist thuds as it slams into
          her face.

          

           GLORIA

           (SCREAMING)
           Fie, fie! What are you mad?

          
          Gloria tries to restrain Capulet. He back-hands her,
          sending her flying against the wall - bellowing insanely, he
          advances on his cowering daughter.

          

           CAPULET
           Hang thee, young baggage!
           Disobedient wretch.

          
          The Nurse throws herself between Capulet and Juliet.

          

           NURSE
           God in heaven bless her!
           You are to blame, my lord, to rate
           her so.

          
          Furious, Capulet shunts her aside.

          

           CAPULET
           Peace, you mumbling fool!

          
          Capulet yanks his daughter's face close to his.

          

           CAPULET (CONT.)
           I tell thee what - get thee to
           church a Thursday
           Or never after look me in the face.
           And you be mine, I'll give you to
           my friend.
           And you be not, hang, beg, starve,
           die in the streets,
           Trust to it. Bethink you. I'll
           not be forsworn.

          
          Capulet storms off down the hall.

          
          CLOSE ON: Juliet. She huddles, shaking at the top of the
          stairs.

          

           JULIET
           O sweet my mother, cast me not
           away!
           Delay this marriage for a month, a
           week.
           Or if you do not, make the bridal

           BED
           In that dim monument where Tybalt
           lies.

          
          A trickle of blood issues from Gloria's cut lip. She checks
          her appearance in the hall mirror.

          

           GLORIA
           Talk not to me, for I'll not speak
           a word.
           Do as thou wilt, for I have done
           with thee.

          
          Gloria leaves.

          

           JULIET
           O God! - O Nurse, how shall this be
           prevented?

          
          The Nurse doesn't reply.

          

           JULIET (CONT.)
           What sayest thou? Hast thou not a
           word of joy?
           Some comfort, Nurse.

          
          A heavy silence.

          
          The Nurse goes to Juliet.

          

           NURSE
           Faith, here it is.
           I think it best you married with
           this Paris.
           O, he's a lovely gentleman!
           I think you are happy in this
           second match,
           For it excels your first; or if it
           did not,
           Your first is dead - or 'twere as
           good he were
           As living here and you no use of him.

          
          Juliet is very still.

          

           JULIET
           Speakest thou from thy heart?

          

           NURSE
           And from my soul too. Else beshrew
           them both.

          

           JULIET
           Amen.

          

           NURSE

           (UNSURE)
           What?

          
          Juliet is matter of fact.

          

           JULIET
           Well, thou hast comforted me
           marvellous much.
           Go in; and tell my lady I am gone,
           Having displeased my father, to
           Friar Laurence,
           To make confession and to be
           absolved.

          
          The old woman nods. She strokes Juliet's hair.

          

           NURSE
           This is wisely done.

          
          Juliet does not look up.

          
          A disturbing choral chant:

          

           DISSOLVE TO:

          

          INT. CHURCH. DAY.


          
          Sunlight pierces stained glass - the chant a sinister
          underscoring. We hear Dave Paris' voice:

          

           DAVE (O/S)
           Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's
           death...

          
          CRANE DOWN: Father Laurence and Dave Paris stand at the
          front of the church.

          

           DAVE (CONT.)
           ...Now, sir, her father counts it

           DANGEROUS
           That she doth give her sorrow so
           much sway,
           And in his wisdom hastes our

           MARRIAGE
           To stop the inundation of her
           tears...

          
          Father Laurence turns. Juliet stands framed in the white
          glare of the doorway.

          
          Dave smiles.

          

           DAVE
           Happily met, my lady and my wife.

          
          CLOSE ON: Juliet's hand concealed beneath her coat - we can
          just see the handle of a gun.

          
          Juliet advances slowly, an icy calm:

          

           JULIET
           That may be, sir, when I may be a
           wife.

          

           DAVE
           That 'may be', must be, love, on
           Thursday next.

          
          Juliet stares past Dave.

          

           JULIET
           What must be, shall be.

          
          Father Laurence, a forced cheerfulness.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           That's a certain text.

          

           DAVE
           Come you to make confession?

          
          Juliet forces a smile.

          

           JULIET
           Are you at leisure, holy father,
           now?
           Or shall I come to you at evening
           mass?

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           My leisure serves me, pensive
           daughter, now.
           (to Dave)
           We must entreat the time alone.

          

           DAVE
           God shield I should disturb
           devotion! - Juliet, on Thursday
           early will I rouse ye;

          
          Dave bends.

          
          CLOSE ON: Juliet; she stares stonily ahead as Dave kisses
          her cheek.

          

           DAVE (CONT.)
           Till then, adieu, and keep this
           holy kiss.

          
          Dave leaves.

          
          TRACK WITH: Juliet; she runs for the sacristy.

          
          The priest follows.

          

          INT. SACRISTY. DAY.


          
          Juliet, shaking with sobs takes refuge in the shadows of the
          small room.

          
          The priest goes to her.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           O Juliet, I already know thy grief.

          
          Juliet pulls away.

          

           JULIET
           Tell me not, Father, that thou
           hearest of this,
           Unless thou tell me how I may
           prevent it.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           It strains me past the compass of
           my wits.

          

           JULIET

           (DESPERATELY)
           If in thy wisdom thou canst give no

           HELP
           Do thou but call my resolution
           wise,
           And with this I'll help it presently!

          
          She pulls the gun, pointing it towards herself.

          
          Horrified, Father Laurence moves to her.

          
          Juliet, panicked, levels the gun at him.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           Hold daughter!

          

           JULIET
           (through tears)
           Be not so long to speak. I lone to
           die!

          
          Father Laurence holds out a soothing hand.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           I do spy a kind of hope,
           Which craves as desperate an

           EXECUTION
           As that is desperate which we would
           prevent.
           If, rather than marry Paris,
           Thou hast the strength of will to
           slay thyself,
           Then it is likely thou wilt

           UNDERTAKE
           A thing like death...

          
          We hear the distended chords of Fauré's Requiem.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)
           to chide away this shame...

          
          It continues throughout as;

          
          The entire screen fills with a glinting tear drop of blue
          liquid.

          
          Reflected in the fluid's convex surface, the face of Father
          Laurence.

          
          The face disappears as the tear drop falls and splashes into
          a clear water solution.

          
          Like a comet in slow motion, the drop stains the water a
          cobalt hue.

          

          INT. GREENHOUSE WORKROOM. DAY.


          
          PULL BACK: The blue liquid fills a tiny glass vial held by
          Father Laurence.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)
           No warmth, no breath shall testify
           thou livest.
           Each part, deprived of supple
           government,
           Shall stiff and stark and cold
           appear, like death.
           Now when the bridegroom in the

           MORNING
           Comes to rouse thee from thy bed,
           there art thou, dead.
           Thou shalt be borne to that same
           ancient vault
           Where all the kindred of the
           Capulets lie.
           In the meantime, against thou shalt
           awake,
           Shall Romeo by my letters know our
           drift,
           And hither shall he come.
           And that very
           Night shall Romeo bear thee hence
           to Mantua.

          
          The priest cautiously hands Juliet the vial.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)
           Take thou this vial, being then in
           bed,
           And this distilling liquor drink
           thou off.
           I'll send my letters to thy lord
           with speed to Mantua.

          

          EXT. CHURCH. DAY.


          
          As Father Laurence speaks, the screen fills with an express
          envelope addressed "Romeo - Mantua." The envelope pulls away
          from the camera and falls into a canvas bag brimming with
          hundreds of like envelopes.

          
          TRACK: With the canvas bag. It continues its journey into
          the back of an express delivery van.

          
          Heavy double doors slam shut, filling the screen with the
          slogan 'Speed Express.'

          
          The van pulls away.

          

           DISSOLVE TO:

          

          EXT. MANTUA. DAY.


          
          A burning red sun is setting over an endless vista of ragged
          wasteland.

          
          CRANE DOWN: A weathered sign reads - Mantua: Behind it a
          vast colony of permanent trailer homes stretches into the
          distance.

          
          The rap, rap, rap of knocking echoes through the park...

          
          CUT TO: The source of the knocking. An express delivery
          man, envelope in hand, raps vigorously on the door of an
          unremarkable trailer.

          

          INT. TRAILER. DAY.


          
          TOPOGRAPHICAL SHOT: Romeo lies flat on a single bed in the
          crampled trailer.

          
          The rap, rap, rap is very loud now. We move toward Romeo
          and realise he cannot hear the knocking because he has
          Walkman headphones on.

          

          EXT. TRAILER. DAY.


          
          Unsuccessful, the delivery man is filling out a "WE CALLED"
          card. He pushes it under the door.

          

           DISSOLVE TO:

          

          INT. CAPULET MANSION. NIGHT.


          
          The heraldic 'Wedding Chimes' by JS Bach. Juliet stands
          resplendent in a radiant bridal gown. The image floats
          ethereally in a towering slab of mirror.

          
          PULL OUT: From the mirror. The wedding dress is in fact
          being held in front of Juliet by two members of the house
          staff. Juliet is dressed in her night gown. The Nurse
          suggests various pairs of shoes.

          

           JULIET

           (DISINTERESTED)
           Ay, these attires are best.

          
          The fuss dispensed with, the staff leave.

          

           JULIET
           But, gentle Nurse,
           I pray thee leave me to myself
           tonight.

          

           NURSE
           Why Bride?

          
          Juliet navigates the Nurse toward the door.

          

           JULIET
           (almost in tears)
           To move the heavens to smile upon
           my state,
           Which, well thou knowest, is cross
           and full of sin.

          
          Juliet holds the Nurse in a pleading stare. She leaves.

          
          Alone now, Juliet hurries to her bedside drawer. She
          cautiously removes a rolled piece of cloth from which she
          produces the glass vial.

          

           JULIET

           (WHISPERS)
           What if this mixture do not work at
           all?
           Shall I be married then tomorrow
           morning?

          
          She cautiously begins to unscrew the tiny black lid.
          Suddenly, a knock at her door. Palming the vial, Juliet
          swings around to meet the arrival of her mother. Gloria
          probes her daughter's uneasiness.

          

           GLORIA
           What, are you busy, ho? Need you
           my help?

          

           JULIET
           (makes light of it)
           No, madam. We have culled such

           NECESSARIES
           As are behoveful for our state
           tomorrow.
           So please you, let me now be left
           alone,
           And let the Nurse this night sit up
           with you.

          
          Juliet begins to pull down the covers on her bed.

          

           JULIET (CONT.)
           For I am sure you have your hands
           full all
           In this so sudden business.

          
          Gloria, sensing Juliet's distress, moves cautiously toward
          her. Taking hold of the bed covers she helps her daughter
          into bed.

          

           GLORIA
           Good night.

          
          Juliet slides into bed. Gloria covers her with the blanket.

          

           GLORIA (CONT.)
           Get thee to bed, and rest, for thou
           hast need.

          
          A brief moment between mother and daughter. Gloria, unable
          to cross that final barrier, moves to the door; but she is
          stopped by the urgency in Juliet's voice.

          

           JULIET
           Farewell!

          
          Gloria turns to Juliet.

          

           JULIET (CONT.)
           God knows when we shall meet again.

          
          CLOSE ON: Gloria. A faint perplexity, and then with an
          almost warm smile she turns out the light and leaves.

          
          The room is in darkness but for patterns of moonlight
          through windows.

          
          TRACK: Toward Juliet. The sombre tones of Fauré's Requiem
          seep into our consciousness.

          

           JULIET
           I have a faint cold fear thrills
           through my veins
           That almost freezes up the heat of
           life.

          
          She brings the vial her mouth.

          

           JULIET (CONT.)
           Come, vial. Romeo, I drink to thee.

          
          Juliet drinks, a sudden violent convulsion, her face contorts
          in fear.

          

           DISSOLVE TO:

          

          EXT. CAPULET ESTATE. DAY.


          
          The sky is filled with green and grey clouds. A gusty rain
          blows the flower arrangements across the lawn. Large white
          wedding marquees flap in the wind.

          
          Through blurring rain, we see ambulances and police vehicles,
          lights flashing. Father Laurence, accompanied by a dour
          looking man in black, alights from his car. We follow their
          P.O.V.: We hear snatches of radio calls.

          

           MEDIC ONE (OVER RADIO)
           Mortal drugs?

          

           MEDIC TWO (OVER RADIO)
           Of lethal quantity as 'twould
           render death.

          

          INT. CAPULET MANSION - DINING ROOM. DAY.


          
          They enter the house and pass the vast dining room, bedecked
          with wedding decorations.

          
          Capulet sits at the large mahogany table. In the background
          Gloria stares vacantly.

          
          Moving swiftly toward a doorway, the music builds.

          

          INT. CAPULET MANSION - JULIET'S BEDROOM. DAY.


          
          The door opens. On the bed Juliet's still body. Father
          Laurence closes the door. The priest kneels and hastily
          examines Juliet's pupils. He looks to the man in black who
          retrieves the glass vial from the floor and pockets it.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           (to the man in black)
           As the custom is,
           In all her best array bear her to
           church.

          
          When the man in black allows two other dark suited men into
          the room, it becomes clear he is the undertaker.

          

           UNDERTAKER
           She shall be borne to that same
           ancient vault
           Where all the kindred of the
           Capulets lie.

          

          INT. MAUSOLEUM. DAY.


          
          A thousand voices proclaim the 'Song of Ascension.'

          
          PAN DOWN: From the vaulting glass ceiling of the Capulet
          mausoleum.

          
          On view, enshrined in literally thousands of lit candles, is
          Juliet's peaceful body.

          
          We move through lines of Capulet mourners. In the shadows
          of the front door a young man hides.

          
          CLOSE ON: The young man. We recognise the distressed face
          of Balthasar.

          
          PUSH IN: Balthasar rushes from the Mausoleum.

          

          EXT. MANTUA. DAY.


          
          We are high above Mantua. Beyond the trailer park stretches
          a long ribbon of black highway.

          
          As a Speed Express van turns off the highway and into the
          park, we hear Romeo's voice over:

          

           ROMEO (V/O)
           If I may trust the flattering truth
           of sleep
           My dreams presage some joyful news
           at hand...

          
          CRANE DOWN: The Express van pulls up at the front office.
          The driver alights and goes inside.

          

          INT. TRAILER. DAY.


          
          Romeo sits at the trailer's small kitchen table smoking and
          writing in his notebook. The "WE CALLED" card lies next to
          an overflowing ashtray.

          
          His voice over continues.

          

           ROMEO (V/O)
           And all this day an unaccustomed

           SPIRIT
           Lifts me above the ground with
           cheerful thoughts.
           I dreamt my lady came and found me

           DEAD
           And breathed such life with kisses
           in my lips
           That I revived and was an emperor.
           Ah me, how sweet is love itself

           POSSESSED
           When but love's shadows are so rich
           in joy.

          
          Stubbing out his cigarette, Romeo gazes through the trailer
          window to see Balthasar's speeding car turn off the highway
          and into the trailer park.

          

           ROMEO
           News from Verona!

          
          An excited Romeo rushes from the trailer.

          

          EXT. TRAILER PARK. DAY.


          
          CRANE HIGH: Romeo sprints across open ground to intercept
          Balthasar's car. We see, but Romeo cannot, the Express van
          approaching from the office. The car slews to a halt and
          Balthasar jumps out.

          
          Romeo yells joyously.

          

           ROMEO
           How now, Balthasar?

          
          Bathlasar cannot speak.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           Dost thou not bring me letters from
           the Priest?
           How doth my lady? Is my father
           well?
           How doth my lady Juliet? That I
           ask again,
           For nothing can be ill if she be
           well.

          
          Balthasar does not know how to say what he has come to tell.
          He looks away.

          

           BALTHASAR
           Then she is well and nothing can be
           ill.
           Her body sleeps in Capels' monument,
           And her immortal part with angels
           lives.
           I saw her laid low in her kindred's
           vault.

          
          For a long moment Romeo is profoundly still. When he
          speaks, it is with a chilling calm.

          

           ROMEO
           Is it e'en so?

          
          Balthasar nods.

          
          Romeo turns and stares into the distant wasteland.

          
          CLOSE ON: He speaks with bitter determination.

          

           ROMEO
           Then I defy you stars.

          
          Romeo moves to the car.

          

           ROMEO
           I will hence tonight.

          
          Balthasar tries to restrain him.

          

           BALTHASAR
           Have patience...

          
          Exploding with fury, Romeo throws Balthasar against the
          vehicle.

          

           ROMEO
           Leave me!

          
          CUT TO: The Speed Express messenger. Returning to his
          truck, the priest's undelivered envelope in his hand, the
          messenger looks toward the two boys.

          
          CUT TO: The boys. Balthasar pleads with Romeo.

          

           BALTHASAR
           Your looks are pale and wild and do

           IMPORT
           Some misadventure.

          

           ROMEO
           (with cold serenity)
           Tush, thou art deceived.
           (a niggling thought)
           Hast thou no letters to me from the
           Priest?

          
          Balthasar shakes his head.

          
          Romeo smiles.

          

           ROMEO
           No matter - I will hence tonight.

          
          Romeo climbs into the passenger seat of the car. Balthasar
          reluctantly gets behind the wheel.

          
          As silent tears begin to flow, Romeo turns his face to the
          setting sun.

          
          PUSH IN: As he whispers:

          

           ROMEO
           Well Juliet, I will lie with thee
           tonight.

          
          Balthasar's car roars out of the park.

          
          CUT TO: The delivery man. He looks to the envelope in his
          hand, then gets back into his truck.

          

          EXT. HIGHWAY. NIGHT.


          
          Balthasar's car speeds along the night-time highway.

          
          CRANE UP: In the distance the glow of city lights.

          

          EXT. ALLEYWAY. NIGHT.


          
          Balthasar's car pulls into an alley and stops outside a
          decrepity apartment block.

          INT. APARTMENT BLOCK. NIGHT.


          
          CLOSE ON: A bespectacled eye peers through the crack of a
          partly open doorway. Below the face, the barrel of a
          shotgun protrudes menacingly.

          
          CUT TO: Romeo in the dark, paint peeling hallway.

          

           ROMEO
           Let me have
           A dram of poison, such soon-
           speeding gear
           As will disperse itself through all
           the veins
           That the life-weary taker may fall
           dead.

          
          The eye considers, a voice rasps back.

          

           APOTHECARY
           Such mortal drugs I have, but
           Verona's law
           Is death to any he that utters them.

          
          Romeo speaks with fury.

          

           ROMEO
           The world is not thy friend, nor
           the world's law.
           Then be not poor, but break it and
           take this.

          
          Romeo shoves a wad of money at THE APOTHECARY'S face.

          
          BEAT. The rattle of a latch chain and the door swings open.

          
          Standing in the doorway is The Apothecary. Sixty something,
          he has a face scarred with age and abuse.

          

           APOTHECARY
           My poverty, but not my will consents.

          
          CLOSE ON: Romeo.

          

           ROMEO
           I pay thy poverty and not thy will.

          

          INT. PRESBYTERY. NIGHT.


          
          CLOSE ON: Father Laurence. He speaks into the telephone
          with concern.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           Who bore my letter then to Romeo?

          

          INT. SPEED EXPRESS DEPOT. NIGHT.


          
          A bored clerk is on the other end of the line. The priest's
          letter is on the counter beside him.

          

           CLERK
           I could not sent it - here it is
           again.

          

          INT. PRESBYTERY. NIGHT.


          
          Father Laurence is worried.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           By my brotherhood, unhappy fortune!
           The letter was of dear import.
           (PAUSE: the priest listens)
           Adieu.

          
          He hangs up the receiver and looks at the wall clock.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)
           Now must I to the monument alone.
           Within this hour will fair Juliet
           awake.

          
          DISSOLVE FROM: The clock to...

          

          INT. APOTHECARY'S APARTMENT. NIGHT.


          
          CLOSE ON: A cat skitters across a stained formica table.

          
          PULL BACK: The Apothecary's apartment is filled with cats.
          Dozens of feline eyes glow in the dim room. Romeo stands
          nervously. The Apothecary extracts a small chemist's vial
          from inside a 'Statue of Our Lady' table lamp - he now
          speaks with cool professionalism.

          

           APOTHECARY
           Drink it off and if you had the
           strength of twenty men it would
           dispatch you straight.

          
          Romeo takes the vial and hands over the money.

          

           ROMEO
           There is my gold - worse poison to
           men's souls
           Than these poor compounds that thou
           mayst not sell.

          

          INT. BALTHASAR'S CAR. NIGHT.


          
          Motor running, Balthasar waits in the alley outside the
          apartment building. He checks the rear view mirror and
          freezes. At the end of the alleyway a police car crawls to
          a halt.

          

          EXT. ALLEYWAY. NIGHT.


          
          Romeo exits the building, and as he does so, the streetlight
          catches his face. The Cop's and Romeo's eyes meet.

          

          INT. POLICE CAR. NIGHT.


          
          CLOSE ON: The cop.

          

           COP
           This is that banished haughty
           Montague.

          

          INT. BALTHASAR'S CAR.


          
          Balthasar cracks; he guns the engine and the car lurches
          forward.

          

          EXT. ALLEYWAY. NIGHT.


          
          Tires screech as Romeo dives into the passenger seat of
          Balthasar's moving vehicle.

          
          Siren blaring, the police car gives chase.

          

          AERIAL SHOT. NIGHT.

          
          Balthasar's car winds through traffic - the patrol car
          gaining.

          

          EXT. ANOTHER PART OF TOWN. NIGHT.


          
          A police car U-turns over a median strip.

          

          EXT. BALTHASAR'S CAR. NIGHT.


          
          TIGHT ON: A rusted brown hood.

          
          The tortured engine screams as Balthasar negotiates the
          speeding car through city traffic.

          
          CRANE UP: Red and blue police light approach fast.

          

          INT. PRECINCT OFFICE. NIGHT.


          
          Captain Prince barrels through the corridors of police
          headquarters pulling on his flying jacket.

          

          EXT. STREET. NIGHT.


          
          TIGHT ON: A smoking tire as it lays rubber to the asphalt.

          
          Balthasar grits his teeth as he weaves the car through the
          impossibly tight space between a container truck and a bus.

          
          WHIP PAN: The patrol car is almost upon them when... in a
          seemingly suicidal manoeuvre Balthasar throws his car into a
          right-angle turn across four lanes of oncoming traffic.
          Horns blare.

          
          CUT TO: A skidding, squealing, out of control sedan, braking
          to avoid collision.

          
          Miraculously, Balthasar's vehicle shoots out of it its path
          and onto the other side of the roadway.

          
          The sedan slams into the following patrol car.

          

          EXT. DRIVEWAY. NIGHT.


          
          Balthasar's car speeds into the driveway of the Verona Beach
          Eternal Rest Cemetery.

          

          INT. CHOPPER. NIGHT.


          
          Captain Prince scans the night time city below. He speaks
          to the pilot and the chopper banks sharply.

          

          EXT. CEMETERY. NIGHT.


          
          CLOSE ON: A stone angel etched against the night sky.

          
          PAN DOWN: Romeo pulls a crowbar from the trunk of the parked
          car. Police sirens sound in the distance.

          
          Romeo eyes Balthasar intently.

          

           ROMEO
           Upon thy life, whatever thou

           HEAREST
           Or seest, stand all aloof. Give me
           the light -

          
          Balthasar stands motionless - Romeo rips the torch from his
          hands and strides into the cemetery. Balthasar follows.

          

           BALTHASAR
           I do beseech you...

          
          Romeo turns, punching Balthasar hard; he goes down, blood
          spurting from his nose.

          

           ROMEO
           Do not interrupt me in my course or
           By heaven I will tear thee joint by

           JOINT
           And strew this hungry churchyard
           with thy limbs!

          
          Balthasar slowly rises. Both boys are trying hard not to cry.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           The time and my intents are savage
           wild,
           More fierce and more inexorable far
           Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.

          

           BALTHASAR
           I will be gone and not trouble ye.

          
          Romeo smiles.

          

           ROMEO
           So shalt thou show me friendship.

          
          They embrace as Romeo whispers.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           Live, and be prosperous; and
           farewell, good fellow.

          

          EXT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.


          
          CLOSE ON: A crowbar wrenches at ornate glass and iron doors.

          
          PULL BACK: The Gothic structure of the mausoleum rears
          against the night sky. Romeo frenziedly attacks the gates
          of the small side chapel.

          

           ROMEO
           Thou detestable maw, thou womb of
           death,
           Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to
           open.

          
          With a final heave the doors scrape open.

          
          Silence.

          
          ROMEO'S P.O.V.: An endless marble corridor lit by hundreds
          of tiny flickering eternal flames.

          
          CLOSE ON: Romeo. He murmurs:

           ROMEO
           In despite I'll cram thee with more
           food.

          
          Suddenly a hurricane wind and whirr of machinery: like a
          huge black insect, Captain Prince's chopper swoops down over
          the mausoleum.

          
          Romeo is caught in the glare of the chopper's burning arc
          light. Sirens scream, police units race through the cemetery.
          Blinded, Romeo fires wildly toward the chopper.

          
          The police cars screech to a halt.

          
          CLOSE ON: A police marksman in the chopper. His finger
          squeezes the rifle trigger.

          
          BANG! A bullet slams into Romeo's shoulder. The other cops
          open fire and Romeo is sent reeling backwards into the
          mausoleum in a fusillade of bullets.

          

          INT. CHOPPER. NIGHT.


          
          An angry Captain Prince bellows into the radio.

          

           CAPTAIN PRINCE
           Hold! Hold!

          
          The police hold their fire.

          

          INT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.


          
          Bleeding from the shoulder wound, Romeo drags shut the heavy
          double doors of the chapel. He bangs off three shots
          through a pane of broken glass and screams at the police.

          

           ROMEO
           Stand all aloof!

          

          EXT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.


          
          Outside the chopper hovers. Police take up siege positions.
          Captain Prince's voice echoes through the bullhorn.

          

           CAPTAIN PRINCE
           Romeo, come forth, come forth.

          

          INT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.


          
          Romeo uses the crowbar to wedge the doors shut. He bangs
          off another shot as he yells out at the Police.

          

           ROMEO
           Tempt not a desperate man!

          
          Romeo waits. There is no response from the cops.

          

          INT. CHOPPER. NIGHT.


          
          As the chopper settles to earth, Captain Prince speaks into
          the radio.

          

           CAPTAIN PRINCE
           Bring forth these enemies Montague
           and Capulet.

          

          INT. PRIEST'S CAR. NIGHT.


          
          Orange rescue lights reflect through the windshield of the
          priest's car as it crawls past the crashed sedan and police
          vehicle.

          
          Father Laurence thumps the steering wheel in frustration.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           Saint Francis be my speed tonight!

          
          Across the road Police swarm around the entrance to the
          cemetery.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           Fear comes upon me.
           O, much I fear some ill unthrifty
           thing.

          
          HOLD ON: The green glow of the car clock as the seconds
          pulse away.

          

          INT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.


          
          TRACK: Down the marble corridor lit by the eternal flames.

          
          DISCOVER: Romeo. He weakly stands at the entrance to the
          viewing chapel.

          
          The chapel is dark.

          
          As Romeo's eyes adjust he can just see, picked out by a
          shaft of blue moonlight, the glowing figure of a sleeping
          girl. He moves down the aisle past the tombs of long-dead
          Capulets.

          
          Romeo is close now. He halts as if in the presence of an
          unbelievable vision. He lights a match and the room glows
          gold. The warm light reveals a Juliet even more beautiful
          in seeming death.

          
          Romeo lights some of the hundreds of candles that surround
          her.

          

           ROMEO
           O my love, my wife,
           Death, that hath sucked the honey
           of thy breath,
           Hath had no power yet upon thy
           beauty,
           Thou art not conquered. Beauty's
           ensign yet
           Is crimson in thy lips and in thy
           cheeks,
           And death's pale flag is not
           advanced there.

          
          Romeo kneels close, as if not wanting to wake a sleeping
          child. Unconscious tears fall from his eyes as he whispers.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           Ah, dear Juliet, why art thou yet
           so fair?
           Shall I believe that unsubstantial

           DEATH
           Is amorous and keeps thee here in

           DARK
           To be his paramour? For fear of

           THAT
           I still will stay with thee. Here,
           oh here
           Will I set up my everlasting rest
           And shake the yoke of inauspicious

           STARS
           From this world-wearied flesh.

          
          He lays himself close.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           Eyes, look your last.
           Arms, take your last embrace. And,
           lips, O you
           The doors of breath, seal with a
           righteous kiss...

          
          Gently Romeo kisses Juliet's lips. Ever so slightly,
          Juliet's hand moves - Romeo does not notice.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           A dateless bargain to engrossing
           death.

          
          Romeo drinks from the vial; the power of the compound is
          immediate. He convulses and falls, his head resting on
          Juliet.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           (fighting for breath)
           O true apothecary, thy drugs are
           quick.

          
          Behind Romeo's head we can see Juliet's eyes opening. Romeo
          sucks the last few breaths of life into his lungs. Through
          a blurry consciousness Juliet becomes aware of Romeo.

          

           JULIET
           Oh Romeo, what's here?

          
          Forcing herself up, she cradles his head in her arms.
          Romeo's clear wide eyes stare back, he is completely still
          but for the sound of weak breaths desperately drawn across
          motionless lips.

          
          Juliet finds the vial clenched in Romeo's hand. Tears slip
          from her eyes.

          

           JULIET (CONT.)
           Drunk all, and left
           No friendly drop to help me after.
           I will kiss thy lips.
           Haply some poison yet doth hang on

           THEM
           To make me die with a restorative.

          
          She delicately kisses Romeo's lips.

          

           JULIET (CONT.)
           (a heart-broken whisper)
           Thy lips are warm.

          
          Desperately the lovers cling to each other. With all his
          desire to stay alive, Romeo whispers:

          

           ROMEO
           Thus with a kiss I die.

          
          There is no breath. He is still. Silence. Sobbing, Juliet
          hugs the lifeless Romeo to her.

          

           JULIET
           Romeo. O' my true love Romeo.

          
          She looks to the gun in his hand.

          

          EXT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.


          
          TRACK: Quickly past Captain Prince and the Capulets taking
          cover behind a patrol car.

          
          Two police officers urgently convey Montague and his wife
          toward them.

          
          Discover Father Laurence arriving.

          
          CUT TO: Father Laurence's P.O.V.: Patrol cars, lights
          flashing, surround the mausoleum.

          
          He sees, through the open door of a police car, a hand-
          cuffed youth. It is Balthasar. Father Laurence hurries to
          him.

          
          It is dawning on Father Laurence.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           Balthasar?

          

           BALTHASAR

           (DESPERATELY)
           I brought news of Juliet's death...
           And then in post came Romeo from

           MANTUA
           To this same place... to this same
           monument.

          
          CLOSE ON: Father Laurence.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           How long hath he been there?

          

           BALTHASAR
           Full half an hour.

          
          Father Laurence turns towards the mausoleum.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           Romeo.
           (a shock of realisation)
           The lady stirs...

          

          INT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.


          
          TRACK SLOW TOWARD: Juliet: Sobbing uncontrollably she prises
          the gun from Romeo's hand.

          

          EXT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.


          
          Father Laurence, desperate, breaks through the police line
          and runs toward the mausoleum.

          
          CUT TO: The parents and Captain Prince.

          

           CAPTAIN PRINCE
           Hold! Go not forth!

          

          INT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.


          
          Juliet turns the gun on herself.

          

          EXT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.


          
          CLOSE ON: Father Laurence, he screams as he mounts the
          mausoleum stairs.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           The lady stirs!

          
          CRACK! The sound of a single gun shot rips through the night.

          
          CUT TO: Captain Prince.

          
          CUT TO: The parents, a look of cold shock.

          
          CUT TO: The priest - his cry echoes through the night.

          

          INT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.


          
          Juliet lies peacefully on Romeo's chest. Her eyes awake. A
          wash of deep red blood floods across them both. As we move
          away from the forms of the two young lovers lit by a ring of
          candles, the police burst in, guns ready to resolve what has
          already been resolved. Continuing up, we pass through the
          glass dome of the viewing chapel, and over the building.

          

          EXT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.


          
          There, huddled at the base of the Mausoleum steps, are the
          Montague and Capulet parents and Father Laurence.

          
          From high up we see Captain Prince emerge from the Mausoleum
          and speak to the group. A moment, then their cries float
          gently up.

          

          EXT. SKY. NIGHT.


          
          We are travelling high into the sky now. The cries of the
          parents and the buzz of radio calls fade to nothing.

          

          EXT. VERONA BEACH STREET - CHRIST ROUNDABOUT-FROM AIR. DAWN.


          
          As the sun struggled to rise, we push toward the figure of
          Jesus silently surveying the city.

          

          EXT. VERONA BEACH - CHRIST ROUNDABOUT. DAWN.


          
          As Jesus' face fills the screen, droplets of water begin to
          streak his cheeks.

          
          HOLD: Music swells; the droplets grow to a torrent, and a
          heavy rain begins to fall.

          
          For a long beat, we stay with this image.

          
          CRANE DOWN: From the Jesus. A sea of black umbrellas
          stretches back from the steps of Freedom Tower.

          

          EXT. FREEDOM TOWER. DAY.


          
          At the top of the steps are a pair of flower strewn caskets.
          Before the caskets stand Fulgencia and Gloria Capulet, and
          Ted and Caroline Montague. They stare with blank,
          uncomprehending sorrow.

          
          Among the crowd we see the distraught faces of Benvolio,
          Balthasar, Father Laurence and the Nurse.

          
          The caskets are gently slid into a pair of long black cars.
          Montague and Capulet descend the stairs. Captain Prince
          blocks their path. He holds them in his gaze.

          

           CAPTAIN PRINCE
           See what a scourge is laid upon
           your hate,
           That heaven finds means to kill
           your joys with love;
           And I, for winking at your discords
           too,
           Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All
           are punished.

          
          The Prince steps aside. The procession moves off. Montague
          and Capulet look to one another, a moment, and then the two
          adversaries together follow the bodies of their dead children.

          
          AERIAL SHOT: The rain falls. Two black cars lead the people
          of Verona Beach in a sorrowful parade.

          
          As the cars pass beneath the towering effigy of Jesus, the
          image pixilates into a television picture.

          
          PULL OUT: A TV anchor woman watches the image on a studio
          monitor.

          
          She turns:

          

           ANCHOR WOMAN
           (to camera)
           A glooming peace this morning with
           it brings:
           The sun for sorrow will not show
           his head.
           Go hence, to have more talk of
           these sad things.
           Some shall be pardoned, and some
           punished,
           For never was a story of more woe
           Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.

          
          The anchor woman changes beat to the next story; but her
          dialogue fades, and her image gets smaller as the television
          recedes into a black distance.

          
          The music that reminds us most of these two lost lives
          swells. When the television is very small it is switched off.

          

          BLACK SCREEN. HOLD A BEAT.
          

          THE END
"Ronin", early, by J.D. Zeik



   










                                RONIN 

                      an original screenplay by

                              J.D. Zeik






                                             DRAFT: May 20, 1997







     A BLOOD RED SCREEN - A JAPANESE DRUM starts to play, softly,
     but tinged with a desperate edge, growing louder, joined by
     other DRUMS as a BLACK LEGEND scrolls up: In feudal Japan,
     the warrior class of Samurai were sworn to protect their
     liege lords with their lives.  Those Samurai whose liege was
     killed suffered a great shame, and they were forced to wander
     the land, looking for work as hired swords or bandits.  These
     masterless warriors were no longer referred to as Samurai,
     they were known by another name: Such men were called Ronin.
     The words hang on the screen and we hold for a BEAT, and then
     the DRUMS are cut off by - A SILENCED GUN SHOT: Thwpfft...

     FADE IN ON:

     INT. A MEDIEVAL CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

     It's dark, and so it takes us a minute to realize we're
     MOVING UP STONE SPIRALING STAIRS, up up up in what we now see
     is a medieval cathedral.  And as we continue MOVING UP
     something TRICKLES DOWN INTO FRAME - BLOOD.  Running thin,
     then thicker, as we CONTINUE TO MOVE UP the stairs and find -
     A BODY, sprawled awkwardly across the stones, arms and legs
     akimbo, not so much Christ-like as victim-like.  In one hand
     the Body holds a GUN he never had a chance to use.  In the
     other - A DARK SHAPE, we can't quite tell what it is.
     FOOTSTEPS sound from above and - THE KILLER walks into frame,
     silenced pistol dangling at his side.  We don't know him, and
     it's going to be a while before we see him again, but mark
     his face because we'll see him again.  The Killer now picks
     up the dark shape in the Body's hand, and we see it's - A
     BRIEFCASE.  The Killer cuffs the Briefcase to his wrist and
     turns to - TWO MEN standing behind him: subordinates.  The
     Killer shows them the Briefcase.

                          KILLER
               God loves me.

     THE BODY suddenly twitches -- this guy is not quite dead.
     The Killer raises his silenced pistol.

                          KILLER
                   (to his victim)
               But I don't think he's too fond of you...

     SLAM CUT TO:

     EXT. A BACK STREET - PARIS - NIGHT

     A PHONE RINGS, replacing the sound of the silenced gun shot
     we expected to hear.

     Rain-slicked cobblestones gleam in a twinkling of
     streetlight.

     EXT. A PHONE BOOTH AT THE END OF THE STREET

     The source of the ringing.  We start to PUSH SLOWLY IN one the
     phone booth, and as we do we hear the VOICE of an UGLY
     AMERICAN.

                          UGLY AMERICAN (V.O.)
               What is this?

     CUT TO:

     INT. A DRIVE BAR IN PARIS - NIGHT

     A SOCCER MATCH is in progress on a TV which sits above the
     bar in this smokey, dim dive.

                          UGLY AMERICAN (O.S.)
               This is not football...

     And now we're PULLING BACK DOWN THE LENGTH OF THE BAR.  We
     see THREE MEN sitting seperately at the bar, paying no
     attention to each other.  One of these men watches the game
     with real interest.  The Ugly American talks on from off
     screen.

                          UGLY AMERICAN (O.S.)
                   (continuing)
               ...Football is three hundred pound guys,
               they run way too fucking fast, they got
               helmets made of kevlar they use to spear
               the quarterback into the next life.

     SLAM CUT TO:

     EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE

     The phone is still ringing, louder now, and we're MOVING
     TOWARDS it while looking THROUGH AN UNSEEN PAIR OF EYES, and
     even as we drink this in we're back in -

     INT. THE BAR

     AT THE END OF THE BAR - LARRY, the Ugly American.  He's got
     an obvious attitude, all of it bad.  But there's something
     about the guy -- he's not all bluster, and he has the look of
     a seasoned tough guy who knows how to get rough and tumble.
     He's big, and yeah he's got a gut, but the rest of him looks
     solid.

                          LARRY
                   (talking to the air)
               You wanna know what football is?  It's
               hitting the other guy dirty and then
               spitting in his face when he's down.
               Football is all things American, and
               American is A-Number-One the absolute
               fucking best there is.  That's what
               football is...
                   (he points to the TV)
               ...And that's not football.

     The one man at the bar who's been watching the gam turns
     slowly and gives Larry a long look.  This is VINCENT: French,
     hard boiled and solid.  Charming when he wants to be, which
     isn't all that often.  He gives Larry a long look and then
     speaks -

                          VINCENT
                   (to Larry in perfect English)
               Football -- American football -- is a
               game for faggots.

     A BEAT.  The other two men at the bar, who seem like tough
     customers themselves, pretend not to watch too closely, but
     they're interested: what's Larry going to say?  For a moment
     it seems as if he's pissed, but then suddenly a smile breaks
     out on his face and he laughs heartily at Vincent's remark.
     Vincent joins in, as do the others.  In particular - THE
     BARTENDER looks relieved -- he's tough enough to toss a bar
     drunk, but these guys are in a different league.  The
     Bartender laughs with the others, happy to have avoided a
     confrontation as we go back to -

     EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE

     We're almost ON TOP OF the phone booth, the phone is still
     ringing as a HAND reaches INTO FRAME and snatches the phone
     from its cradle.

                          A WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                   (a touch Irish accent)
               Yes?

     ANOTHER ANGLE - And we see a woman named DEIRDRE on the
     phone: striking, dark-haired, Irish.  She carries herself
     with the same professional edge as the men inside the bar.
     Deirdre listens for a moment to the voice on the other end,
     and before she speaks she sense something - A SILHOUETTE
     stands in the shadows of the bar, watching Deirdre.  She
     gives this silhouette a measure glance before speaking, her
     hand creeping ever so slightly towards her coat.

                          DEIRDRE
               Can I help you?

     The silhouette steps into a POOL OF LIGHT.  This is SAM.
     Tough, lean, enigmatic.  Somebody you might trust, but whom
     you'd never cross.  Sam returns her look before he speaks.

                          SAM
               No...

     Sam moves towards the bar, and Deirdre returns to her phone
     conversation.

                          DEIRDRE
               I'm here...
                   (a beat, responding to a
                    question)
               No, it was nothing.

     INT. THE BAR - A MINUTE LATER

     Sam enters and by now the men inside have all come together
     at the bar, talking casually, recognizing they're somehow all
     here for a reason.  With Larry and Vincent we see - GREGOR, a
     man from Eastern Europe.  His accent is hard to pin down,
     but he most definitely has one.  Gregor has the air of an ex-
     spook, and that's exactly what he is.  Lastly we see SWEDE --
     blonde, muscular, and somehow blank in the face.  No, he's
     not stupid -- he's a sociopath.  Now - Sam looks at the
     group, which grows quiet as he enters.  Finally, Sam speaks.

                          SAM
               Sorry I'm late...

                          VINCENT
                   (a challenge)
               What makes you think we're here to meet
               you?

                          SAM
                   (meeting Vincent's gaze)
               Who else would you be?

     Vincent turns towards the others, including them in an
     expansive gesture.

                          VINCENT
               Perhaps the police?

                          SAM
               I know cops -- and you're no cop.

     Vincent smiles at Sam's answer, satisfied, and makes room for
     Sam to join them.  Vincent takes a pack of cigarettes, shakes
     them so that one sticks out, and offers it to Sam.

                          VINCENT
               Cigarette?

                          SAM
               No thanks.

     Vincent looks a little disappointed at this as we go -

     EXT. BACK OUTSIDE - SAME TIME

     THE PAY PHONE makes a sharp noise as it's cracked back into
     the cradle.  Deirdre stands at the phone booth, lost in
     thought.  Then, without warning - Deirdre spins around,
     pulling TWO GUNS from inside her coat.  The move is fast,
     performed with the grace of a professional killer, as Deridre
     scans the horizon, but nobody seems to be watching.  Deirdre
     pockets her guns and steps into the shadows of the street,
     the better to watch -

     THE BAR - And as Deirdre watches the bar we watch her.
     PULLING BACK from Deirdre, UP INTO THE AIR and then MOVING
     THROUGH TO -

     INT. A CHEAP APARTMENT - SAME TIME

     LOOKING THROUGH A WINDOW, donw onto the street below.  Barely
     visible we can see Deirdre.  And staring at Deirdre - THE
     WATCHER.  Somebody we're going to see periodically through
     the movie.  Right now he's only a SILHOUETTE with a well-
     defined PAIR OF HANDS.  And in those hands - A KNIFE.  As the
     Watcher watches he slowly cleans his nail with the knife,
     methodically, perfectly.  And he watches.  First Deirdre, and
     then turning his attention to THE BAR.  He's especially
     interested in the bar.

     A TIME CUT TO:

     INT. THE BAR - LATER

     The BARTENDER is wiping out a last glass.  When this is
     finished he looks up at -

     A TABLE IN THE BACK -

     Where our five guys have relocated.  Now the Bartender and
     Vincent exchange a look, and then the Bartender takes out a
     set of keys and tosses them - THROUGH THE AIR and they SMWACK
     into Vincent's hand.  The Bartender and Vincent speak in
     rapid-fire French, and then the Bartender is gone.  Sam turns
     to Vincent.

                          SAM
               He trusts you to lock up?

                          VINCENT
               Let's just say he knows who I am.

     Vincent takes out his pack of cigarettes and offer them
     around the table -- again, nobody takes on.  Vincent seems
     really disappointed by this.

                          LARRY
               Anybody wanna tell me what we're waiting
               for?

                          VINCENT
                   (lighting his cigarette)
               The question isn't what we're waiting
               for... it's who.

                          LARRY
               And who the fuck is that?

                          GREGOR
               Whoever hired us.

                          SAM
               I got this gig through a contractor.
               And he most definitely didn't know who
               was doing the hiring, only that they
               were paying a lot of money...

     There's a kind of general look around the table -- a nod or
     grunt of acknowledgement, indicating that all of these men
     were hired the same way.

                          SAM
                   (continuing his thought)
               So none of us knows who's paying the
               freight, this is just some anonymous job.
               For all we know, we're working for
               different people.

                          GREGOR
               Now that is an interesting proposition.

                          SWEDE
               How so?

                          GREGOR
               Because if there's more than one party
               involved, if we really are working for
               different people, then perhaps some of us
               are on different sides.
                   (with great meaning)
               Your orders might be different from mine.

                          LARRY
               What're you talking about, man?  I don't
               understand.

                          SWEDE
                   (quietly, but loud enough to be
                    heard)
               What a surprise...

                          LARRY
               I got a surprise for you, blondie...

                          GREGOR
                   (sharply, as if he's used to
                    giving orders)
               Why don't both of you shut up?

                          LARRY & SWEDE
                   (to Gregor at the same time)
               Fuck you!

                          SAM
               Knock it off!

     There is a BEAT.  Gregor, Swede and Larry look at Sam, who
     glares them all down.  Lastly, Sam turns and looks at
     Vincent.  The two men nod at one another, acknowledging a
     kind of mutual respect.

                          SAM
               The point remains: we could be working
               for different people.  There's a chance
               for one of us...
                   (looks around the table)
               Maybe more than one of us -- has been
               paid to cross the others.  I don't know
               about you guys, but I like to know who
               I'm working for.  It can help prevent a
               great deal of...
                   (finding the right word)
               ...unpleasantness.

                          LARRY
                   (patting the gun inside his
                    cheap suit)
               Anybody tries to unpleasant me I'll put
               two between his eyes -- one to do the job
               and the other to make sure it takes.

     From OFF SCREEN we hear a new sound: LAUGHTER.  ANOTHER ANGLE -

     Deirdre has entered the bar, and she's amused by this last
     exchange.

                          DEIRDRE
               It's good to see you've all got such
               faith in our little undertaking.

                          LARRY
               Who the fuck are you?

                          DEIRDRE
                   (staring at Larry)
               The name is Deirdre, and I'm running this
               show.

                          GREGOR
               Who are you?  IRA?

                          DEIRDRE
                   (with a brittle laugh)
               Not likely.  Once, yeah, I was -- but
               there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and
               I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my
               meaning.  I'm a hired gun, same as the
               rest of you, and that's all any of us
               needs to know about the other.

     Deirdre hands out several thick envelopes.  Larry and Swede
     open theirs and stare at the wads of Franc Notes stuffed
     inside.  Even Gregor cracks his envelope and peaks at his
     money.  But neither Vincent nor Sam takes a look.

                          DEIRDRE
               From here on in you want something you
               pay cash for it: no credit cards, no bank
               accounts are in place: ten percent up
               front, the rest when the job is done.
                   (a quick beat, then she looks
                    at Gregor)
               You.  What do you do and what should we
               call you?

                          GREGOR
               These days they they call me Gregor -- and
               I'm a tech.  I do electronic work,
               surveillance, computer runs.

     Deirdre turns to Sam.

                          SAM
               Sam.  I'm a weapons guy.

                          DEIRDRE
               You were a soldier, were you?

                          SAM
               Once.

     Deirdre gives Sam a look -- and he returns it.  Finally,
     Deirdre turns to Larry.

                          LARRY
               I drive -- and my name is Larry.  Larry
               from the States.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (she turns to Vincent)
               And who are you?

                          VINCENT
               I'm Vincent.  And I coordinate.

                          SAM
                   (sharply)
               Coordinate what?

                          VINCENT
               Things.  This is my country, you know.

     The two men exchange another look.  A pecking order is
     developing among the group: Vincent and Sam are both natural
     leaders, and now they're feeling one another out.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (to Vincent)
               Coordinate all you want, but make sure
               whatever you do gets cleared through me.
                   (Vincent doesn't respond for a
                    moment)
               Are we in sync on this, Vincent?

                          VINCENT
               Of course.

     Deirdre waits a BEAT, letting Vincent know what she isn't any
     more intimidated by him than he is by her.  Finally, she
     turns to Swede.

                          SWEDE
               They call me Swede.

                          LARRY
               Who's they?

                          SWEDE
               Everybody.

                          VINCENT
               And what is it you do?

                          SWEDE
               Me?
                   (with a smile)
               I kill.

     CUT TO:

     INT. A WAREHOUSE - DAY

     A PAPER TARGET, in the shape of a human being, dances in
     place as it is riddles with GUNSHOTS, each shot hitting the
     target in the belly, each shot fired by - Larry, whose been
     shooting a sleek automatic pistol from which he's just
     discharged an entire clip.  The gun is empty, Larry turns to
     Sam, who stands next in line.

                          SAM
                   (looking at the target)
               You shoot alright.

                          LARRY
               Gets the job done.

                          SAM
               All in the stomach, though.  Your man
               might live.

                          LARRY
               Not for long.

                          SAM
               Long enough to shoot back.

                          LARRY
               Is that right?

                          SAM
               It's been known to happen.

                          LARRY
                   (a challenge)
               Why don't you go do better, then...

     Without a word, Sam pops a new clip into the gun and SHOOTS
     THE LIGHTS out of several other human targets, hitting each
     target in a different place.  One he clips between the eyes,
     the next in the heart, one in the groin, and then the last
     target - He SPLITS DOWN THE MIDDLE, firing shot after shot
     from the head to the groin until the target is sheared in
     half.  Larry is impressed in spite of himself.

                          LARRY
               Yeah, well...  My way works too.

                          SAM
               My way is better.

     IN A CORNER OF THE WAREHOUSE -

     Gregor has set up a table loaded with computers and
     electronic whizmos.  Right now Gregor is holding a
     particularly high-tech type CELL PHONE in his hands, looking
     at it almost lovingly.

                          DEIRDRE (O.S.)
               Is it alright?

     ANOTHER ANGLE - Deirdre sits nearby, looking at the cell
     phone.

                          GREGOR
               It's quite satifactory.

                          DEIRDRE
               Good, because it cost enough.  There's
               cheaper phones by far than that one, man:
               you better fucking use it.

                          GREGOR
                   (almost caressing the phone)
               I intend to.  This phone is wired like no
               other: it's got an encryption chip and
               instant sat-a-link recognition, it can
               talk to any computer in any language and
               make it understand.  With my custom
               hardware and this phone I can trace the
               target's cell phone signature and follow
               him anywhere he goes...

                          DEIRDRE
               You sure about this?

                          GREGOR
               I'd stake my reputation.

                          DEIRDRE
               But would you stake your life, that's the
               question...

                          GREGOR
               In this business, your life and your
               reputation are more often than not one
               and the same.

     From off screen we hear MUNCHING.  It's - Larry inhaling a
     sandwich.  A malicious look comes over Swede's face, who's
     cleaning a pistol and sitting near Larry.

                          SWEDE
               You should watch what you eat.

                          LARRY
               Who the fuck died and appointed you food
               czar?

                          SWEDE
               I'm just worried about your health,
               Larry.  You could stand to shed a few
               pounds.

                          LARRY
                   (sensitive about his weight)
               And you could stand to get a little
               smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde
               fuck?

                          SWEDE
                   (sensitive about the dumb
                    blonde thing)
               Who you calling dumb, dickless?

     Both men eyeball one another, and then suddenly Larry reaches
     for his piece, and as soon as he does this Swede does the
     same thing, but before they can do anything - DEIRDRE'S GUN
     swings INTO FRAME, smashing Swede in the face and dropping
     him to the floor.  Larry's mouth drops open in surprise, but
     it's too late: Deirdre kicks him in the stomach and then
     rabbit punches him in the back of the neck, driving him to
     the ground.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (standing above them)
               Next one of you fuckers plays this game
               I'm going to do for you myself.  I won't
               say it again: we don't have time for this
               shit!  There's a clock running on this
               job, gentlemen, and I mean to be on
               schedule.

     A TENSE MOMENT as Deirdre stares down at these tough guys --
     letting them know who's in charge.  A SOUND from OFF SCREEN
     interrupts this moment: a DOOR opening, as we see - Vincent,
     who stands in the door, wearing his coat and hat.

     He's been out somewhere, and he looks first at the squabbling
     men, and then at - Deirdre.  She gives Vincent a little nod --
     a silent command that makes Vincent turn to Sam.

                          VINCENT
               Let's go for a ride.

     Vincent and Sam start off, moving towards the door, while Swede
     and larry slowly pick themselves up off the ground.

                          SAM
               Where to?

                          VINCENT
               To see a man about a thing.

                          SAM
               I can do that.

     EXT. THE WAREHOUSE - SUNSET

     A DESOLATE URBAN LANDSCAPE - Sam and Vincent walking away
     from the warehouse, which is housed in what looks to be the
     toughest neighborhood in the city, filled with CHEAP CONCRETE
     PUBLIC HOUSING and INDUSTRIAL BUILDINGS.

     THE SETTING SUN throws a red glow on the street, giving the
     raw concrete buildings a blood-colored tint, as Sam and
     Vincent approach a FIAT, a car neither too old nor too new.
     Before they can reach the car, the two men are intercepted by
     FOUR TOUGHS, young guys in their early twenties.  The LEADER
     of the Toughs apporaches Vincent.

                          LEADER
                   (subtitled French)
               Who gave you permission to park here?

                          SAM
                   (to Vincent)
               What's he saying?

                          VINCENT
               Pretty much what you'd expect.

                          SAM
                   (with a sigh)
               That's what I thought.

                          LEADER
                   (in French)
               There's a charge for parking on our
               block.

     The other Toughs add lib a few tough guy remarks (in French,
     of course).

                          VINCENT
                   (to Sam)
               He says this is their block.

                          SAM
               As in, they own it?

                          VINCENT
               Something like that...

                          SAM
               And I suppose he's saying that we oughta
               give them something for using it, huh?

                          VINCENT
               I didn't know that you spoke French.

                          SAM
               I don't.  But the language he's speaking
               is universal.

     ANGLE ON THE LEADER - Who's smirking at Vincent and Sam.
     Sam's words make a great deal of sense: the Leader is
     speaking the universal language of "give me some money or
     I'll kick your ass."

                          SAM (O.S.)
               I guess we oughta give them something...

     CUT BACK TO: Vincent and Sam.

                          VINCENT
               If you think we should.

     Vincent backfists the Leader in the nose -- hitting him so
     hard that the Leader skitters back on unsteady feet and then
     sits down on his ass.  This blow hurt, but the real damage is
     to the Leader's pride.  Now - One of the Toughs rushes at
     Sam, only to have Sam perform what looks like a jujitsu throw
     which savagely jerks the Tough off his feet and flattens him.

                          SAM
                   (as if it were an accident)
               Oh man, I am sorry about that...
                   (he sticks his hand out)
               Let me give you a hand.

     Sam reaches down as if to help the Tough, who ignores the
     hand and totters to his feet.  As soon as he's up he turns
     and runs away, followed by the other Toughs.  Now only the
     leader is left behind.  He looks for a second at Vincent and
     Sam, and then turns and runs after his friends.  Vincent
     calls after him in French, but whatever he says isn't
     translated.  Vincent turns to unlock the car.

                          SAM
               What'd you say to him?

                          VINCENT
               I asked if we could give him anything
               else.

     By now the two men are in the car, which starts up and drives
     off, as it does we -

     CUT TO:

     INT. THE FIAT - SAME TIME

                          VINCENT
               That was a nice move you did on our young
               friend.  Judo?

                          SAM
               Jujitsu.

                          VINCENT
               Same thing, isn't it?

                          SAM
               Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.

                          VINCENT
               What's the difference?

                          SAM
               One's a lot more painful than the other.

     Vincent laughs, and Sam looks out the window at the city of
     Paris as we MOVE THROUGH to the outside world of -

     EXT. PARIS DRIVING MONTAGE - TWILIGHT

     A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS of the car driving through Paris at
     night.  We don't see familiar sights like the Eiffel Tower or
     the Arc de Triomph, but instead - We travel through the LEFT
     BANK, down a series of Mazy Alleys which twist and turn,
     filled with bistros, bars and falafel joints.  NEON SIGNS
     line the streets for as far as the eye can see.  Near the end
     of this trip we hear the SOUND OF A MATCH FLARING, followed
     by -

                          SAM (V.O.)
               Could I get one of those?

     INT. THE CAR - STILL DRIVING - SAME TIME

     Vincent is driving and smoking a cigarette.  He tosses his
     pack to Sam, but he seems a little surprised at Sam's
     request.

                          VINCENT
               Help yourself.
                   (quick beat)
               Since when do you smoke?

                          SAM
                   (lighting up)
               I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a
               week.

                          VINCENT
               A cigarette?  As in one?
                   (exasperated, almost to
                    himself)
               One cigarette a week, who smokes like
               that?

                          SAM
               I do.

                          VINCENT
               Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day,
               and I tell myself I could be worse.
                   (takes a satisfying drag)
               It's just so damned pleasurable.

                          SAM
                   (blowing a smoke ring with
                    great skill)
               It has it's moments.
                   (stubs out cigarette)
               Course, you get cancer and die, that's
               the down side.

                          VINCENT
                   (with a sigh)
               There is that.

     Vincent stamps his cigarette out, looking vaguely unhappy
     that Sam has spoiled his smoke.

                          SAM
               So, Vincent: why bring me along for the
               ride?  Job like this calls for a warm
               body, somebody who can stand around and
               look threatening.  A tough guy.

                          VINCENT
               Like Larry or Swede.

                          SAM
               Exactly.  Why not bring them?

                          VINCENT
               Let's just say I thought the
               conversational possibilities were
               limited.  Of course, I might have brought
               Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right
               candidate -- for this.

                          SAM
               Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for
               sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB.  He's
               smart, Gregor is.

                          VINCENT
               So is the woman.

                          SAM
               Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously
               goddamned dangerous.

                          VINCENT
               I wonder if she truly left the IRA.

                          SAM
               I've wondered that myself.  None of this
               answers my question, though...
                   (suddenly direct)
               Why bring me?

                          VINCENT
               I wanted to see who you were.

                          SAM
               Who am I?

     Vincent, driving all the while, gives Sam a sideways glance
     before speaking.

                          VINCENT
               You were once some kind of special
               forces.  Airborne Ranger, maybe a Navy
               SEAL.  After that you rode shotgun for
               the CIA in some place like El Salvador or
               Afghanistan, a real mercenary.
                   (beat)
               Only now -- now you're like the rest of
               us, it's a very competitive market since
               the end of the cold war.  There's a lot
               of hired guns out here, and not nearly
               enough work to go around.

                          SAM
               That's right: there's not hardly enough
               work these days, nothing that pays the
               big money, anyhow.  Then along comes this
               job, paying so much goddamned money I
               couldn't afford not to take it.  Somebody's
               paying through the nose for this.

                          VINCENT
               They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're
               going to steal, it must be quite
               something.

                          SAM
               Whatever it is it must be goddamned
               priceless.

     And on that thought we -

     CUT TO:

     EXT. A SIDE STREET - NIGHT

     The Fiat pulls up to the curb and Vincent and Sam get out.
     Vincent leads Sam around a corner and they come to -

     AN EXQUISITE PARK, a small, perfectly manicured place -- a
     kind of mini-Luxembourg Gardens in the middle of nowhere.
     When Sam sees the park, he draws an involuntary breath.

                          VINCENT
               Lovely, isn't it?

                          SAM
               They'd have to keep something like this
               under lock and key in New York, and it
               would still get fucked up.

     The two men enter the park, which is, indeed, open to the
     public.  Inside, sitting on a bench in the back, almost
     invisible from the street, we see - FRANCOIS, a stubble-faced
     tough with a stained shirt and bad teeth.  Vincent and Sam
     draw near.  This next conversation between Francois and
     Vincent is in FRENCH WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES.

                          FRANCOIS
               That's good right where you are, Vincent.

     Vincent signals for Sam to stop.  Both Vincent and Sam are
     still several feet away from Francois.

                          VINCENT
               Do you have it?

                          FRANCOIS
               Not so fast.
                   (nods slightly to Sam)
               Who's that?

                          VINCENT
               He's company.

                          FRANCOIS
                   (as if he recognizes Sam)
               Bad company...

                          VINCENT
               What do you mean?

                          FRANCOIS
               He's a cop, Vincent, he's French and he's
               a cop and you better shoot him in the
               fucking head right now!

     Sam hasn't said a word -- he doesn't seem to understand
     what's been said, but he has noted the urgency with which
     Francois spoke.  Now - We HOLD FOR A BEAT.  Neither Vincent
     nor Francois pulls out a piece to shoot Sam.  Instead they
     wait to see if Sam will respond in any way to what Francois
     said.  The conversation now switches to ENGLISH, which (it
     turns out) Francois speaks fairly well.

                          SAM
                   (to Vincent)
               What's going on?

                          VINCENT
               I just wanted to see something.

                          SAM
                   (that edge creeping into his
                    voice)
               See what?

     Vincent isn't going to answer, but the overbearing Francois
     chimes in.

                          FRANCOIS
               He wanted to see how you reacted when I
               said that you were a cop.

                          SAM
                   (he can't believe this)
               You told him I was a cop?

                          FRANCOIS
               He asked me to say it.

                          SAM
                   (looking at Vincent, truly
                    pissed)
               He asked you to?

                          VINCENT
               I needed to know.

                          SAM
               You need to know a lot of shit, Vincent.

                          FRANCOIS
                   (to Vincent, in subtitled
                    French)
               Are you ready?

     Francois's French words give Sam pause -- he's wondering
     what's being said, as - Vincent moves towards Francois,
     leaving Sam several steps away.  The conversation is again in
     SUBTITLED FRENCH.

                          VINCENT
                   (taking out an envelope)
               Here's yours.

                          FRANCOIS
               There's been a slight problem.

                          VINCENT
                   (immediately tensing)
               What's that?

     Francois gives the slightest of nods, indicating that Vincent
     should look towards a place perhaps thirty yards away -
     A COPSE OF TREES, where we see a SNIPER pointed a telescopic
     rifle at Vincent.

                          FRANCOIS
                   (still in subtitled French)
               If you say a word in English, Vincent, my
               friend with the high powered sporting
               rifle will shoot you in the throat.
               Sorry to screw you over like this, but
               the information you want might get me
               killed if I give it to you, and that's a
               price I'm not willing to pay.

                          VINCENT
                   (in French)
               I take it you still want the money...

                          FRANCOIS
                   (in English, with a grin)
               Of course.

     SAM'S POV: Looking at Vincent and Francois.

     The men are talking, and from here we can't really hear them
     speak.  All Sam can see is an earnest Vincent listening to
     Francois talk, almost as if Francois is giving Vincent
     instructions.  Now - Vincent reaches into his pocket,
     reaching for the envelope of cash he's carrying.  As he hands
     the money to Francois, Vincent uses his free hand to pull out
     his gun while - Sam already has his gun out -- somehow he
     figured out what was going on -- and now Francois looks on in
     stunned disbelief as -

     Sam fires a single shot, hitting Francois in the shoulder,
     driving him away from - Vincent, who now squeezes off several
     rapid fire shots at the sniper, while - Francois, bleeding
     but still very much alive, now has his piece free just as -
     The Sniper, his gun firing wildly into the air, falls to the
     ground, shot dead by Vincent, and now - Francois is drawing a
     bead on Vincent when - Sam hits Francois with a fusillade of
     bullets in the chest and now - A SINGLE SPENT BULLED CASING
     flies through the air in SLOW MOTION and lands on the ground,
     spinning around until it comes to a halt and - A HEAVY
     SILENCE FALLS, as the last echo of the last gunshot finally
     dies.  Vincent and Sam look at one another, see that they're
     still alive, and then look back at - The two men they've
     shot.  Francois isn't quite dead.  Blood bubbles from his
     lips as Vincent leans over him.  Again, they speak in
     SUBTITLED FRENCH

                          VINCENT
               Where's my information?

                          FRANCOIS
                   (with a grim smile, pointing to
                    his head)
               In here...

                          VINCENT
               Then you better find it in your heart to
               tell me, Francois, because while your
               death is inevitable, it still isn't
               decided how painful it's going to be.

     A LONG ANGLE - Vincent whispers in Francois's ear, whose grin
     blanches as he realizes Vincent means to hurt him.  Francois
     whispers something back and then - BANG.  Vincent shoots
     Francois in the head, killing him instantly.  Then Vincent
     bends down and retrieves the envelope of money which Francois
     had tucked inside his shirt.  As Vincent does this, Sam comes
     up from behind.

                          SAM
               Now would be a good time to get the fuck
               out of here.

     INT. THE FIAT - LATER/NIGHT

     The two men drive in silence for a moment.  Vincent lights a
     cigarette and offers one to Sam, who refuses.  Finally, Sam
     speaks.

                          SAM
               You know, what you pulled back there,
               that was bullshit.

                          VINCENT
               I needed to see if you were a cop.
                   (defensively)
               I'm a popular man with the police, Sam,
               and whenever they try to catch me they
               always do it with an inside guy -- some
               man on some job who seems more
               trustworthy than all the others put
               together.  And that's the guy you have to
               watch out for.
                   (beat)
               I hate cops...

                          SAM
                   (insulted that Vincent would
                    even consider it)
               Well I ain't a cop.

     A BEAT, the two men driving in silence.

                          VINCENT
               How did you know?

                          SAM
               Know what?

                          VINCENT
               That there was a gun pointed at me.

                          SAM
               I saw you look off when Francois nodded
               his head.  I figured he wasn't pointing
               out a particularly rare shrub, and the
               rest was easy.

                          VINCENT
               But how did you know I would have the
               presence of mind to pull my weapon
               when I did?

                          SAM
                   (as if it's obvious)
               Because that's what I would have done...

     CUT TO:

     EXT. AN APARTMENT HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER/NIGHT

     Vincent's Fiat is parked at the curb in front of this
     apartment house.  Vincent and Sam exit the car and move
     towards the house -- a silence hanging between them.  Right
     before they go into the house, Vincent takes out the envelope
     full of cash that was supposed to have been for Francois.  He
     thinks for a moment and then hands the whole envelope to Sam.

                          VINCENT
               You saved my life back there in the park.
               I know this doesn't begin to make it
               right between us...

     Vincent's voice trails off -- he doesn't know what to say.
     Sam takes the money out of the envelope -- half he keeps for
     himself, the other he gives to Vincent.

                          SAM
               What I did back in the park I did because
               we're working together -- we're on the
               same team.
                   (holding up the money)
               This is business -- this is work.  We did
               it together, we share the spoils, even
               split.

     Sam opens the door to the house, but Vincent has one last
     thing to say to him.

                          VINCENT
               I owe you a heavy debt.

     Sam almost smiles cynically at this: debts of honor don't
     seem to be something he believes in.

                          SAM
               Whatever you say.

     They enter the house and the door closes behind them.  A
     second later we hear -

                          DEIRDRE (V.O.)
               What'd you do with the money?

     INT. THE HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER

     Vincent and Sam sit with Deirdre in a room, alone.  They've
     told her about the park, and she seems a little pissed about
     all of this.

                          VINCENT
               We kept it...

                          DEIRDRE
                   (a little annoyed)
               Is that right?

                          SAM
               Hazard pay...

                          DEIRDRE
                   (with an exhalation of disgust)
               The two of you were supposed to go to a
               simple meet and come back with a simple
               piece of information, and instead you
               went to fucking war...

                          SAM
               We weren't real thrilled about it
               either...

     Deirdre shakes her head in disgust and rises.  We FOLLOW HER
     INTO -

     AN ADJOINING ROOM -

     Where Larry, Swede and Gregor are waiting.  They look up
     expectantly at Deirdre, who crosses through the room without
     stopping -- she's really pissed about this turn of events.

                          LARRY
               So what's the deal?

                          DEIRDRE
                   (barely stopping, very
                    snappish)
               The deal?  The deal is we leave for Nice
               at first light.

     And she exits, leaving these three men behind along with Sam
     and Vincent, who have entered from the other room.  larry
     looks at the two of them.

                          LARRY
               What'd you guys do?

     EXT. OUTSIDE THE HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

     A CAR sits, cloaked in shadows.  Inside sits our friend, the
     WATCHER.  Once again we see the Watcher's knife -- once again
     he manicures his nails with it, almost delicately, as he
     watches the House.  It's dark -- a single light glows behind
     a window on the third floor.  Sam's room.

     INT. SAM'S ROOM - SAME TIME

     Sam has pushed all the furniture aside to make enough room to
     do a martial arts form.  Right now he's frozen, one leg
     extended in a kick, balancing on the other leg.  Now - A
     KNOCK at his door -- seconds later, it opens.  Deirdre stands
     there, watching as Sam holds his position for a BEAT more,
     and then retracts his leg.

                          DEIRDRE
               I feel as if I've wandered onto the set
               of Enter The Dragon.  Could you teach me
               to do that?

                          SAM
               I didn't think to see you again tonight.
               You were pretty pissed.

                          DEIRDRE
               I still am.

                          SAM
               Is that right?

                          DEIRDRE
               That's right.

     Deirdre spings at Sam, throwing martial arts combinations at
     him: punch followed by kick, elbow strike followed by palm
     thrust.  Sam parries her blows as she drives him across the
     floor until he's got his back to the wall.  Their movements
     are controlled, but powerful, and there's something almost
     flirtatious about the whole thing.  Now -

     Deirdre throws one last punch which Sam ducks.  He slips
     behind her and suddenly they square off in earnest.  The
     previous martial arts stuff was a kind of choreographed
     exercise, but now - They spar for real -- they never hit one
     another, but they come awfully close, hands and feet whizzing
     through the air, throwing rapid-fire combinations and
     techniques.  They're not angry, but they're not kidding,
     either.  Finally - Deirdre feints a punch that distracts
     Sam's attention from - The KICK she throws right behind her
     punch, and she smiles as - WHUMP!  Sam wasn't distracted at
     all -- he drops to the ground beneath her kick and catches
     her standing leg with a sweep which takes her to the ground
     and now - She's trapped beneath him.  The two of them are
     breathing hard from the exertion, their faces close to one
     another, shining with sweat and excitement and - We've gone
     from flirting to an almost primal seduction, and with their
     faces only inches apart Deirdre leans in to kiss Sam, and
     he's about to meet her half way when he pulls back.

                          SAM
               Part of me says I should just look at
               this as a perk.  You know, a bonus.  But
               then I remember you're you -- Deirdre
               who used to belong to the IRA -- and it
               occurs to me that deceit and subterfuge
               come very naturally to you.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (kissing him very lightly)
               Nobody's saying they don't.

                          SAM
                   (returning the kiss, just as
                    lightly)
               And when I consider that, I have to
               wonder if you don't have some ulterior
               motive for being here, with me, right
               now.

                          DEIRDRE
               I probably do.
                   (pulling him close)
               But for the time being, I'm willing to
               forget about it...

     They finally kiss, slowly and then building in intensity, and
     as they start to make love the

     CAMERA MOVES UP - THROUGH THE BUILDING, floor by floor, until
     we've reached -

     EXT. A ROOFTOP GARDEN - MEANWHILE

     Deirdre and Sam are not the only ones indulging in
     extracurricular activities.  Up here in this rooftop garden
     we find Swede and Gregor talking in hushed tones.

                          GREGOR
               I would imagine that the great
               satisfaction in all of this will be
               killing the American.

                          SWEDE
                   (we know this isn't true)
               I hadn't thought about it.  Understand
               me, Gregor -- I take no pleasure in
               killing.  It doesn't bother me one bit,
               but I don't get off on it.

                          GREGOR
               A means to an end, is that it?

                          SWEDE
               That's it.

                          GREGOR
                   (he rises to leave)
               Then I guess we're set.

                          SWEDE
               There is one other thing...

                          GREGOR
               What's that?

     Suddenly Swede pulls Gregor down to the rooftop with a harsh
     THUD.  Within seconds he has his gun pressed to Gregor's
     head.

                          GREGOR
               What are you doing?

                          SWEDE
               Don't cross me...

                          GREGOR
               Nobody's going to do that!

                          SWEDE
               Really?

                          GREGOR
                   (truly frightened)
               I need you, Swede, I can't do this
               without you!

                          SWEDE
                   (beat, then he puts his gun
                    away)
               I just wanted to make sure you knew who
               you were dealing with.

                          GREGOR
               I do, I do...

     Swede is now on his feet, walking away, back into the
     apartment house.

                          SWEDE
                   (this is almost to himself)
               Just remember it, then.

     And he's gone.  And as soon as he is, we notice something
     strange about Gregor: he's not the least bit scared -- he
     laughs a little low laugh as we - 

     DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. THE HOUSE - DAWN

     GRAY LIGHT seeps in from the horizon, while inside in -

     INT. SAM'S ROOM - SAME TIME

     Deirdre is pulling her dress over her head.  Sam seems to be
     sleeping in his bed as she moves like a cat towards the door
     when -

     Sam's HAND reaches out, gently yet firmly, and takes her by
     the arm.

                          SAM (O.S.)
               No goodbye?

     ANOTHER ANGLE - Sam is somehow sitting up, wide awake --
     looking at Deirdre with a penetrating glance.

                          DEIRDRE
               Look, Sam, don't take it the wrong way
               when I tell you we won't be doing this
               again.

                          SAM
               You don't have to explain yourself to me,
               Deirdre.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (almost surprised by this)
               I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just
               that, for once, I want to.  when I was a -
                   (almost with a sneer)
               Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with
               any man it was deemed necessary for me to
               sleep with.  You know: any man who needed
               setting up.  Sometimes so we might
               blackmail him, sometimes so he could be
               killed.
                   (a quick beat)
               Sometimes so I could kill him myself.
               IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist
               organization, Sam.  To most of the men I
               with I was always the girl.  "Send the girl
               to do it."  "Tell The girl to take care of
               it."  "Have the girl fuck him."
                   (a quick beat)
               But I look at you and I get this feeling
               you take me for what I am: no more, no
               less.

                          SAM
               You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like
               me.

                          DEIRDRE
               Exactly.  And last night I wanted to be
               with someone who was just like me.

     Somewhere in all of this Deirdre has sat back down on the
     bed, and somehow now she's only inches away from Sam.
     They're lips brush and -

     A MUTED PHONE RINGS in a nearby room, breaking the moment.  A
     QUICK BEAT, then -

                          DEIRDRE
               I better be getting that.

                          SAM
               Duty calls?

                          DEIRDRE
                   (with a trace of a sigh)
               Just business.

     Deirdre gives Sam a light kiss on the lips and then she opens
     his door.  The muted phone is a little louder now.  Deirdre
     closes Sam's door as she exits, but - Sam reaches out a hand
     and catches the door right before it snaps shut.  He watches
     THROUGH THE DOOR CRACK as - Deirdre cross the hall and
     opens the door to her room, and now the phone rings loudly
     until the door shuts, muting the sound once again, shutting
     Sam out.  The phone stops ringing as Deirdre answers and as
     this happens Sam shuts his door and as the door closes we go
     to - BLACK.  Just for a second.  And then - BLINDING SUN hits
     us in the eyes as we find ourselves above -

     EXT. NICE - DAY

     A DAZZLING OVERHEAD MOVING SHOT, establishing that we've
     changed locales, moved to a place filled with sun and blue
     water and reflective surfaces: the Cote d'Azure.  We start to
     MOVE DOWN TOWARDS -

     EXT. A PRIVATE BEACH - NICE - MEANWHILE

     A TOPLESS GRANDMA reclines on a beach chair, soaking up rays,
     sipping a drinnk just delivered by a young stud of a WAITER.
     Nearby -

     AT A ROUND TABLE -

     A nice distance from anyone who might try to listen in, we
     find our group: Deirdre, Sam, Vincent, Gregor, Swede, and
     Larry.  Food and drink surround them.  Larry is, of couse,
     still eating.

                          DEIRDRE
               Now then, let's run through it one more
               time, shall we?
                   (to Gregor)
               What's your job?

                          GREGOR
               I use my cell phone to get computer
               access to the telecommunications
               satellite used by our target.  I trace
               his cell phone signature and use it to
               pin point his location as he moves
               through Nice, relaying that information
               to you.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (to Larry)
               Next.

                          LARRY
                   (a sigh, he's done this too
                    many times)
               You call me with the target's route, I
               follow along until we've reached the
               attack point and then I run his squag ass
               off the road.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (to Swede)
               Which leads us to...

                          SWEDE
               I ride with fat-boy...

                          LARRY
                   (under his breath)
               Eat shit and die slowly...

                          SWEDE
               After we stop the target car I get out
               and use the heavy artillery to kill the
               driver and his bodyguard.

                          LARRY
               I blast the lead car into oblivion...

                          VINCENT
                   (picking up)
               While Sam and I take out the back two
               cars...

                          DEIRDRE
               Leaving...

                          SWEDE
                   (picking it up)
               ...Leaving me to step in, drop the target
               in the back seat, and get the package...

                          DEIRDRE
                   (with a quick look at Sam)
               While...

                          SAM
                   (returning her look)
               ...While I back him up, making sure to
               get the package if something goes wrong
               and somebody takes Swede down.

     Nobody else seems to notice this look between them, but we
     should -- if only to note that there's something about the
     way Deirdre queries Sam about his role, and something about
     the way Sam answers her without overly reacting -- they're
     not flirting, but there's a kind of acknowledgment of the
     history they now have between them.  But -- nobody else
     notices, and Swede's line follows Sam's without breaking the
     flow of the dialogue.

                          SWEDE
               Nobody's taking me anywhere...

                          DEIRDRE
               And then...

                          LARRY
               Then Swede and I split with the package
               and meet you back at the rendezvous.

                          DEIRDRE
               And then...

                          VINCENT
               And then Sam, you and I clean up
               whatever's left to be cleaned.

                          DEIRDRE
               Very good.  Now all we have to do is live
               long enough to get paid.

     EXT. A POSH HOTEL - LATER - NIGHT

     A ROW OF ROOMS, each one with a light behind a shade.  Even
     as we watch the light in each room goes off: one two three
     four five six lights -- one for each member of the team.  The
     night before the big event nobody breaks curfew.

     ACROSS THE STREET -

     A BAR -

     Through the bar window we see the Watcher's silhouette.  A
     match flares as the Watcher lights a cigarette, REVEALING his
     face for the first time: weathered, sharp, treacherous.  THE
     MATCH goes out, and the Watcher's face FADES TO BLACK, and so
     do we.

     FADE IN ON:

     EXT. THE HILLS OF NICE - MORNING

     A PRIVATE ESTATE IN THE HILLS -

     A CARAVAN OF BLACK ARMOR PLATED CARS, all idling, ready to
     pull out, filled with muscular men in suits with bluges under
     their jackets, all of them waiting for - THE TARGET.  Except
     we've seem him before and he wasn't called the Target: he was
     the Killer from the first scene of the film: the gunman in
     the cathedral who made off with -  THE BRIEFCASE.  Which the
     briefcase is still handcuffed to his side.  Now the Target
     gets into his car, a BLACK MERCEDES, and as soon as he's in
     the caravan pulls out and - The Target takes out his cell
     phone, punches in a number and starts to talk, and as he does
     we - PULL BACK, INTO THE AIR, leaving the Caravan behind as
     we MOVE TOWARDS THE WATER and -

     THE PROMENADE DES ANGLAIS, the long roadway that runs the
     length of the town adjacent to the beach.  It's a special
     place, a huge road for cars, along with a promenade for
     tourists.  Here we come upon -

     AN OUTDOOR CAFE -

     Where we find Deirdre, a laptop in front of her, wearing a
     HEADSET.  And, lest we think she looks out of place, we get
     a look at -

     THE REST OF THE CAFE -

     Where many of the other PATRONS are typing away on laptops,
     or chattering like crazy on their cell phone.  She types a
     sentence on her keyboard, and as she types she says it out
     loud.

                          DEIRDRE
               Alright, Gregor, I'm...

     CUT TO:

     INT. A CRAMPED COMPTUER CONTROL ROOM - SAME TIME

                          GREGOR
                   (finishing her sentence)
               Ready when you are...

     Gregor is sitting behind a console, looking at Deirdre's
     message, which we can read on his laptop.  Gregor also has a
     much bigger COMPUTER with him as well, and on this screen we
     see - A COMPUTER GRAPHIC MAP OF NICE.  This is a map of
     incredible detail, a high-tech graphic rendering of Nice.
     Now - THE MAP starts to shift, randomly moving about the city
     as it searches for the proper signal.  The computer isolates
     an entire district of the city, enlarges a part of the
     district, and then locates and enlarges a single street.  Now
     - On screen a FLASHING CURSOR appears on the map, the TARGET.
     The Cursor starts to move down one of the streets of Nice and
     as we follow the Curson it TURNS INTO - THE TARGET CAR,
     driving home the point that Gregor is now locked onto the
     Target.  THE JAPANESE DRUMS we heard in the opening sequence
     start to play again -- softly, ominously, and we're on -

     EXT. A SIDE STREET

     Where VINCENT'S FIAT is parked at a curb, Sam and Vincent
     sitting inside.

     INT. THE FIAT

     Vincent sits behind the wheel, while Sam sits next to him,
     loading a small arsenal of weapons.

     The DRUMS grow, a little louder now, a little more urgent.

     EXT. ANOTHER STREET

     A VOLVO idles, waiting for something, Larry behind the wheel
     of this car, and sitting next to him Swede.  The DRUMS
     continue to play, and their volume is still low, but they're
     jarring, setting our nerves on edge.

     INT. THE VOLVO

                          LARRY
               Where is this broad?

                          SWEDE
               You should learn a little patience.

                          LARRY
               Is that right?

                          SWEDE
               It's consider a virtue in some corners
               of the world.

                          LARRY
               Not in mine.

     THE CAR PHONE rings, and Swede pushes a button.  Deirdre's
     Voice is heard on the speaker phone.

                          DEIRDRE (V.O.)
               Hello gentlemen, are we ready?

     EXT. THE CAFE

     Deirdre looks at her laptop and relays Gregor's instructions.
     She speaks over her headset as if she's conducting ordinary
     business -- as if she's giving someone traffic directs
     over the phone.  The JAPANESE DRUMS continue, quiet and yet
     intense.

                          DEIRDRE
               You want to take a left, then, so that
               you're going west.

     During this next sequence, the DRUMS will continue to play,
     building with the action as we do -

     THE CHASE MONTAGE: A SERIES OF CUTS AS -

     The Volvo takes a flying left turn -

     Gregor watches the Target on his computer as it moves towards
     the Promenade des Anglais, typing the results on his
     keyboard as - The Volvo careens down a steep hill, hits a
     bump, and flies through the air a good fifteen feet, even as -
     The Fiat follows close behind and hits the same bump, does
     the same flight through the air and lands with a thud -

     THE CARAVAN of cars -

     THE TARGET CAR -

     THE TARGET, still talking away on his cell phone - THE
     COMPUTER MAP tracking the Target's movements, as the Map
     shifts and moves as it keeps pace with the target, and now -

     The Promenade des Anglais is right ahead and the DRUMS build
     to a crescendo as -

     The Volvo SMASHES into the Target Car and they grind
     together, as -

     CARS 3 & 4 in the Caravan are cut off by Vincent's Fiat,
     which forces them to slam to a halt, as -

     Larry runs the Target Car to a halt and the JAPANESE DRUMS
     stop.

     Larry and Swede hop out of the Volvo, and Swede brandishes a
     MONSTER of a MACHINE GUN, with which he opens fire, a blast
     of huge guage shells spitting a trail of fire, smashing
     against THE WINDSHIELD of the Target Car, which is bullet-
     proof.  The windshield doesn't break right away -- but the
     heavy blast of firepower causes the windsield to buckle.

     Sam and Vincent are now out of the Fiat, guns drawn, blazing
     away at BODYGUARDS, and Christ, there's an army of them,
     pouring out of Cars 3 & 4.  These guys are armed and returning
     fire as -

     Larry gets out of the driver's seat of the Volvo, and he's
     got some kind of sumbitch weapons himself, a ROCKET LAUNCHER,
     which he points and fires - And now we TRACK THE MISSLE as
     it scorches the air, traveling towards -

     The LEAD CAR of the caravan which has only now realized
     what's going on behind it, and as frantic Bodyguards drive
     back towards the carnage - The Missle IMPACTS, blowing the
     Car sideways.

     Meanwhile - Sam and Vincent are taking out the Other
     Bodyguards, and these guys are warriors -- they moves as a
     team, each man with a gun in both hands, using a weapon until
     it's out of bullets and then discarding it in favor of a new
     one.

     And even as this is going on - Deirdre has joined the fray,
     firing both of her pistols, taking Sam's place at Vincent's
     side so that Sam can run towards -

     The Target Car, where the Target is seated in the backseat,
     pulling out his own piece, ready to fight to the death
     himself as -

     Swede continues blasting away at the windshield with his
     monster gun, and now - The Windshield has started to crack
     and splinter, and abruptly, it shatters, instantly bursting a
     bright red as Swede's bullets tear up the body of the Driver.

     Now Sam has reaches the Target Car, just as the Target, who
     is armed and, as we know, not exactly helpless, steps out of
     the car and sights in on Swede and - ZING!  Sam fires,
     winging the Target, knocking the gun out of his hand and
     still the Target won't give up without a struggle, he hits
     Swede with the Briefcase.

                          THE TARGET
               Fuck you!

                          SWEDE
               Not today.

     BANG.  Swede puts one shot between the Target's eyes, ending
     his life.  Now - Swede takes out a DAI-SHO, the smaller of the
     two traditional Japanese Samurai swords.  With one slashing
     blow he hacks off the Target's HAND AT THE WRIST and grabs
     the briefcase.  The SEVERED HAND is still caught in the
     handcuffs, so that it is carried along for the ride.  Now -
     DISTANT SIRENS sound from OFF SCREEN as Swede moves back
     towards Larry and the Volvo, and as he goes he raises the
     briefcase (with its severed hand) in a kind of mock salute to
     Sam, who starts to move back towards Deirdre and Vincent, who
     have taken care of the remaining Bodyguards, and now the
     SIRENS are growing closer as we - START TO MOVE IN SLOW
     MOTION as Swede approaches the Volvo and - Deirdre and Vincent
     are already at Vincent's Fiat, waiting for Sam, and so they
     don't notice that - A VAN has been parked nearby this entire
     time, and now the van's side door slides open, and unseen by
     any of the others - Gregor steps out of the Van, a gun at his
     side, and a predatory look on his face as - Swede reaches Larry
     and the Volvo just as - Sam has reaches the Fiat, and now he looks
     back and sees - Gregor, crossing the street, and now - Sam
     screams a warning to Larry, but it's way too late because -
     Swede shoots Larry in the neck, hitting him above the
     protective covering of his bullet proof vest.  Now we're
     MOVING IN REAL TIME as - Larry manages to get his backup
     piece drawn, a snub-nosed .38, and he fires all six shots
     into - Swede, hitting him in the stomach -- it's the same way
     Larry shot the target in the warehouse.  Swede is sent flying
     backwards, where he crashes to the pavement.  For a second we
     think he's dead, but then he gets up, in pain but alive, just
     as Sam predicted.  Swede claws at his shirt to reveal that he
     too wears a bullet proof vest.  By now - Larry has rolled out
     of the Volvo, crawling away but too weak to go far, and now -
     Swede has Larry in his sights, he's going to kill him.

                          SWEDE
               I don't particularly like killing, tubby,
               but I want you to know that this one I'm
               going to enjoy.

                          LARRY
                   (sees something over Swede's
                    shoulder)
               I don't think so.

     Swede turns to follow Larry's gaze, and as he does - Gregor
     walks INTO FRAME and puts his gun right beneath Swede's chin.
     Before Swede can even compute this, Gregor pulls the trigger,
     firing straight up into Swede's brain.  Then, without even
     looking at Larry, who is lying helpless on the ground -
     Gregor takes the briefcase and gets into the Volvo, driving
     off just as - Sam arrives, kneeling down by Larry.  The SIRENS
     get louder.

                          LARRY
                   (in shock)
               He just...I don't believe that son-of-
               a...

     Vincent's Fiat comes peeling to a halt in front of them,
     Vincent and Deirdre inside it as Sam manages to get Larry
     into the back seat.  Sam doesn't get in the car yet as Larry
     says -

                          LARRY
                   (still having trouble believing
                    it)
               We've been crossed...

     The SIRENS reach a crescendo as a group of GENDARMES arrive,
     charging with automatic weapons drawn.  Between the French
     cops and our heroes lies the shot up wreck of the Target Car,
     and now - Sam takes out a GRENADE, pulls the pin, and rolls
     it across the ground, beneath the Mercedes, which the cops
     have just reached.  Seconds later - The Car EXPLODES, cutting
     off the cops, and as this happens, Vincents puts the pedal to
     the floor and gets the fuck out of Dodge.  We start to SLOWLY
     PULL BACK on the remains of this battle: the dead bodies, the
     shot up cars, the broken glass, and that flaming, smoking
     hulk of a Mercedes in the middle of the street.

     DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. THE OLD CITY/NICE - SUNSET

     The FIREBALL of the car turns into a BLOOD RED SUN as it sets
     in the Western sky, tinting the stone buildings of the Old
     City a coppery red.

     We're MOVING THROUGH the Old City, through the twists and
     turns of what an American would call back alleys but that
     pass for streets in this place.  It is quiet almost deserted,
     then - A TESTOSTERONE CRAZED PLAYBOY whips his sports car
     through one of these streets, engine whining, as we - MOVE
     DOWN yet another side street, and this sucker really is a
     back alley, you couldn't get a car down here if you tried.
     Finally, we come to - A RAT TRAP OF AN OLD BUILDING, and we
     PUSH TIGHT on this building as we hear -

                          LARRY (V.O.)
               What is this?

     INT. A BACK APARTMENT - SAME TIME

     A SYRINGE is plunged into Larry's arm.  Sam is tending to
     Larry's wound.  Sam seems to know what he's doing, as Larry
     is also hooked up to a bottle of plasma hanging on a make-
     shift stand.

                          SAM
                   (answering Larry's question)
               It's a cocktail.  Mostly demerol, cut
               with a little crank because we might need
               you awake in the real near future.

                          LARRY
               Fine with fucking me, we got work to do.
               I don't care what it takes, we are
               getting our property back and putting it
               into the hands of the people who are
               gonna pay us a great deal of money when
               we do.  I don't know about the rest of you
               guys, but I'm not the kind of guy
               to just sit back and take it in the ass.
                   (a quick beat)
               I don't mean that in, like, a literal
               way...

                          DEIRDRE
               Of course.

                          VINCENT
               Finding this package is a thing easier
               said than done.  We don't even know what
               it is.
                   (he looks at Deirdre, and
                    suddenly he's deadly earnest)
               What did we steal?

                          DEIRDRE
                   (suddenly defensive)
               I don't know.

                          VINCENT
               When this whole thing started you made it
               clear: you're running the show.  And I
               don't believe you'd be running this show
               if you didn't know what was going on.

                          DEIRDRE
               Well I don't!

                          VINCENT
               And I don't believe you...

     Vincent's gun is out in the blink of an eye, at Deirdre's
     head, but she's as fast as he is and her gun is drawn as
     well, jammed into his stomach.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (suddenly feral) 
               You go shoot me if you want, Vincent, but
               you'll be dead before I hit the ground.

                          VINCENT
                   (matching her intensity)
               I don't want you dead, woman, I want the
               the truth!

                          SAM (O.S.)
                   (with a dead cool in his voice)
               Both of you...

     ANOTHER ANGLE - Sam has the two of them covered with his gun -
     an interesting moment, because he can shoot either Deirdre or
     Vincent, but not both at the same time.  The question is:
     whose side is he on?

                          SAM
                   (continuing without missing a
                    beat)
               ...put your guns down and chill out.

     A BEAT.  And then Vincent and Deirdre lower their weapons,
     followed by Sam.

                          SAM
               Like it or now, we're on the same side:
               we're here and the package isn't.
                   (looks at Deirdre)
               You're not the boss any more, you're our
               partner.  So tell us what you know, so we
               can figure a way out of this mess.

     Sam's look isn't romantic, but it implies a level of trust
     based upon their physical intimacy.

                          SAM
               Now, what did we steal?

                          DEIRDRE
                   (she hates to admit this)
               I don't know...
                   (defensively, off Vincent's
                    look)
               Well I don't!  It's a goddamned mystery
               to me just like it is to you.
                   (quick beat, then reluctantly
                    continuing)
               But I do know who we're working for.  My
               people, and the Russian mob.

                          LARRY
               Your people?  Who the fuck is your
               people?

                          VINCENT
               Who do you think, Larry?  The IRA.

                          DEIRDRE
               And you believed me?
                   (passionately)
               But it wasn't my people who did it.

                          LARRY
               How do we know that?

                          SAM
               Because if they had she'd be gone along
               with the package, instead of sitting here
               with us.

                          DEIRDRE
               Exactly.  Gregor, he was the Russian's
               man.  It was my people came up with the
               idea for this run, but the Russians who
               had the capital to finance it.  Gregor,
               he was their insurance, and I was ours.
               Everybody else was supposed to be
               neutral.  Gregor must've got to Swede...

                          LARRY
               I never did trust that blonde fuck...

                          DEIRDRE
               That's why you were riding with him.

                          VINCENT
               The question still remains: what do we do
               now?

                          SAM
                   (he figures something out)
               Gregor's cell phone...

                          LARRY
                   (to himself)
               What are you gonna do, call him up and
               ask him to give us back our shit?

                          SAM
                   (ignoring Larry, to Deirdre)
               Did he bring that with him?

                          DEIRDRE
               I bought it for him -- all the stuff he
               was using, it was in his contract.  Cost
               a nice penny, too, especially that
               goddamned phone: Gregor had expensive
               tastes.

                          SAM
               Check this out.
                   (he's thinking on his feet)
               Gregor's a spook, or he was one until
               recently.  When he was a spy he lived the
               life -- you know, a prince in some
               Eastern Bloc country where nobody had
               shit and Gregor had everything.  Then the
               wall goes down.  No more Cold War.  And
               Gregor is out of a job.  No apartment, no
               special stores with Western food and
               video tapes.  I would bet dollars against
               shit that Gregor liked that phone and he
               doesn't want to give it up.  And I
               wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant
               enough to think...

                          DEIRDRE
                   (finishing his sentence)
               That we're too stupid to trace his calls.

     Deirdre and Sam share the slightest of conspiratorial smiles
     as they realize they're both thinking the same thought: they
     might still win this one.

     EXT. AIX EN PROVENCE - TWILIGHT

     We're on perhaps the MOST BEAUTIFUL STREET in all of France:
     the Cours Mirabeau in the town of Aix.

     Outdoor cafes line the sides of the street, while a canopy of
     interlocking trees covers everything.  Now we're - MOVING,
     DOWN THE STREET, towards a CAFE, where a DAPPER GENT sits,
     sipping a mineral water.  The Gent has a SATCHEL at his feet.
     Now - A JEEP pulls up to a nearby corner and idles in
     neutral.  The Dapper Gent throws some bills on the table and
     gets up, crossing to - The Jeep.  A door opens, and the
     Dapper Gent, carrying his satchel, gets into the jeep, which
     drives off as we -

     CUT TO:

     INT. JEEP - SAME TIME

     Gregor and the Dapper Gent drive in silence for minute, down
     the length of the Cours Mirabeau.

                          GREGOR
                   (breaking the silence)
               It's a beautiful street, no?

     The Dapper Gent also has an accent, a much thicker one than
     Gregor's; it's an accent that places the Gent as a resident
     of what used to be called the Soviet Union.

                          DAPPER GENT
                   (he can't wait any longer)
               Do you have it?

                          GREGOR
               Always in a rush, you are.  All these
               years I've known you, you could never
               wait for anything.

                          DAPPER GENT
               This is important.

                          GREGOR
               Do you really think so?

                          DAPPER GENT
               You know it is.

     Gregor, still driving, takes out a SILENCED PISTOL, and the
     Dapper Gent reaches for his own piece.

                          GREGOR
               Relax!

     The Dapper Gent loweres his hand, leaving his gun in his coat.
     Gregor pulls the van to a curb.

                          GREGOR
               Look over there.

     GREGOR & THE GENT'S POV: THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD - A GROUP OF
     CHILDREN are playing.

                          GREGOR (O.S.)
               Do you see that one?  The girl in the
               light blue dress?

     We find one particular LITTLE GIRL, around eight, holding the
     end of a jump rope, wearing a light blue dress.  She's
     breathtakingly beautiful, and now - Gregor raises his
     silenced pistol, as if to shoot her.

                          DAPPER GENT
               What are you doing, have you lost your
               mind?!?

     Gregor pulls the trigger, as he does so the Dapper Gent jogs
     his arm, and we hear the soft thwpfft of the silenced shot
     just as the shot goes off - Missing its mark, harmlessly
     shooting into a tree, causing a SINGLE LEAF to float to the
     ground behind the playing children.  Nobody notices a thing.
     BEAT.  The Dapper Gent is visibly shaken, because there is no
     doubt that Gregor would have killed the Girl if the Gent
     hadn't ruined his aim.

                          DAPPER GENT
               Why did you do that?

                          GREGOR
               To make a point.  I don't know her, and I
               was ready to splatter her brains all over
               the sidewalk.
                   (giving the Gent a look)
               I don't particularly like you, so imagine
               what I'll do if you try anything...

     Gregor leaves his gun dangling in the air a moment longer than
     necessary and then starts the jeep as we -

     CUT TO:

     EXT. A COUNTRY ROAD OUTSIDE OF AIX - NIGHT

     A FULL MOON casts a silver light over a field of wild grass.
     A soft wind blows, and the grass moves gently from side to
     side.  Now - Gregor's JEEP glides down this road as we MOVE
     THROUGH TO -

     INT. THE JEEP - SAME TIME

                          DAPPER GENT
                   (squirming)
               Enough!  We've been driving for an hour,
               where is my package?

     Gregor smiles -- he's been waiting for this.  He pulls the
     jeep over and looks at the Dapper Gent.

                          GREGOR
               It's under your seat.

                          DAPPER GENT
                   (incredulous)
               What?

                          GREGOR
               As my American friend Larry would say:
               are you fucking deaf?  It's under your
               seat.

     The Dapper Gent looks down, and sure enough, the edge of the
     Briefcase sticks out beneath the seat.

                          DAPPER GENT
               I can't believe you'd do that, Gregor.  I
               thought I trained you better than that.

     With a laugh the Dapper Gent hands his satchel to Gregor,
     whose eyes literally dance with the prospect of his reward.
     He can't help himself, he opens the satchel and there it is -
     COLD HARD CASH in large bills, enough for Gregor to live like
     a prince for quite some time.  Gregor sucks in an involuntary
     breath and then looks back up to see - The Dapper Gent hasn't
     reached for the Briefcase.  Instead he's taken out his gun,
     and it's only inches from Gregor's head.

                          DAPPER GENT
               I've never particularly liked you either,
               Gregor.

     The Dapper Gent yanks out the Briefcase, and as he does -

     THE SEVERED HAND comes whipping out along with it, still
     attached by the handcuff chain.  The Hand flies up in the
     Dapper Gent's face, and we notice that the Hand is starting
     to rot -- it's bloated and swelling and horrific and it
     scares the shit out of the Dapper Gent, who drops his gun and
     fumbles with the Briefcase as - THWPFFT...we hear the sound
     of another silenced shot as we -

     SMASH CUT TO:

     EXT. OUTSIDE THE JEEP - SAME TIME

     A DARK STAIN splashes against the passenger side window of
     the jeep.  Seconds later - The door swings open, and the
     Dapper Gent's body plunks out onto the ground.  A moment
     later, something wet and viscous plops down on the face of
     the Gent as the jeep drives off.  Now - We HOLD FOR A BEAT on
     the Dapper Gent's dead body, which lies in the silver
     moonlight, blood running out from beneath him, while the
     Severed Hand palms the Gent's face, fingers splayed out
     around his head.  Now - We HEAR the sound of PHONE TONES.
     And not just any phone...

     INT. THE JEEP - SAME TIME

     Gregor finishes punching a number into his CELL PHONE.  We
     hear a single ring on the other end of the phone before it is
     picked up.

                          PHONE VOICE (V.O.)
                   (in Russian, English subtitles)
               Is it done?

                          GREGOR
                   (in English)
               It's done.

     BEAT.  The Phone Voice doesn't respond for a moment -- whoever
     this is they didn't expect to hear from Gregor.  The Voice
     switches to English.

                          PHONE VOICE (V.O.)
               Gregor, is that you?

                          GREGOR
                   (with a low chuckle)
               Much to your disappointment, no doubt.

                          PHONE VOICE (V.O.)
               It was a mistake, it shouldn't have
               happened.

                          GREGOR
                   (suddenly cold, furious)
               I'm in the middle of saving you people a
               great deal of money -- the least you
               could do is have the decency to pay me!

     BEAT.

                          PHONE VOICE (V.O.)
               So what do we do?

                          GREGOR
               What I do is none of your concern.  What
               you should do is wait for my next phone
               call.  I'm going to find a place where I
               can tilt the field in my favor.  When I'm
               ready, I'll call you and tell you what I
               want you to do.

     The Phone Voice says something unintelligible in Russian, cut
     off by Gregor as he angrily snaps off his cell phone and we -

     CUT TO:

     INT. THE CHEAP APARTMENT - DAWN

     Larry snores on the couch, while Deirdre sleeps in a sleeping
     bag on the floor.  Vincent sits in a ratty easy chair, feet
     propped on an overturned crate, dozing lightly.  Suddenly -
     Vincent's eyes open, warily, as if something has changed in
     the room.  He looks around - No Sam.  Vincent gets up, takes
     out his gun, and silently gets to his feet.  He moves down a
     long hall and - No Sam.  Now, like a cat, Vincent moves into -

     THE BATHROOM: pitch black.  He moves in, swipes the string of
     the overhead light and - nothing.  Nobody's here.  The only
     place left is the front door, and now Vincent approaches.  He
     opens the door, gun still at ready, and moves out into -

     INT. THE LANDING OUTSIDE - SAME TIME

     This is a small building.  There is no other apartment on
     the floor.  At the far end of the landing, there is a small
     ladder which leads up to -

     THE ROOF.  And the door which leads to the roof is flapping
     in a light wind.

     EXT. THE ROOF - SAME TIME

     Vincent bursts onto the roof, gun straight out, finger on the
     trigger, only to find - Sam is there, his gun pointed at
     Vincent.  A BEAT, then both men give little laughs and put
     their weapons away, like Samurai so trained in combat that
     they know when it's safe to relax.

                          SAM
               What's going on?

                          VINCENT
               You weren't around when I woke up, I
               thought maybe something had happened.
                   (off Sam's look)
               This has been one very fucked up job,
               Sam, and I'm not taking any more chances
               on anybody...
                   (a quick beat)
               Including you...

     In answer Sam takes out Vincent's pack of cigarettes and
     tosses them back to him.  Vincent looks almost delighted at
     this.

                          SAM
               I came up here to sneak a smoke.

                          VINCENT
               You were smoking?

                          SAM
               I hope you don't mind I took your pack.
               It was on the table.

                          VINCENT
                   (very sincere, offering the
                    pack)
               Please, help yourself.  Smoke as many
               you'd like.

     Sam considers for a minute, and then takes one.  Vincent does
     so as well, and he searches for his lighter, which he can't
     seem to find, because - Sam has it, and he lights their
     cigarettes, and then hands the lighter back to Vincent.

                          SAM
                   (a shrug of the shoulders)
               I borrowed that, too...

                          VINCENT
                   (puffing contentedly)
               Of course...whenever you feel like it
               just help yourself.

                          SAM
               I have a feeling I'm about to start
               buying my own.

     BEAT.  The two men smoke in silence, looking out at -

     THE CURVED SHORELINE OF NICE -

     Which glitters with thousands of lights from the apartment
     buildings, and a thousand more from the cars that travel on
     the road that leads into town: the Promenade des Anglais.

                          VINCENT (O.S.)
               That was a bad bit of business, today.

     BACK ON Sam and Vincent.

                          SAM
               It was at that.

                          VINCENT
               A lot of people died.

                          SAM
               I've seen a lot of people die before.

                          VINCENT
               I haven't.  Not like that.  How do you
               get used to it?

                          SAM
               You don't.  You just learn to live with
               it.

                          VINCENT
               I won't lie -- there have been times when
               I had to do it, times when the only way
               to get out alive was to see that the
               other man didn't.

                          SAM
               We live in a singular world, my friend.

                          VINCENT
               I never really thought I was part of the
               world you move in, Sam, to tell you the
               truth.
                   (off his look)
               I'm a hood, a thief.  Big time in a small
               time king of way.  To the local police
               I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a
               legend.  But to a guy like you I'm just
               another two bit hired gun.

                          SAM
               You might be a hired gun, Vincent, but I
               got a feeling you cost more than two
               bits.

     This conversation might have gone further, but it is
     interrupted when Deirdre pokes her head up onto the roof.

                          DEIRDRE
               Christ, I was starting to think that the
               two of you had thrown it in and walked
               away.
                   (to Vincent)
               There's someone on the phone downstairs
               asking for you, and my somewhat limited
               French leads me to believe that he might
               have something to tell us about Gregor.

     EXT. THE HIGHWAY - LATER - NIGHT

     A car we haven't seen before, a CITROEN, hums up the French
     highway in the night, along on the road.  It's a postcard
     moment, but only for a moment.

                          LARRY (V.O.)
               I'm telling you...

     INT. THE CITROEN - SAME TIME

                          LARRY
                   (continuing)
               That I could be dead and I'd drive better
               than you.

     Deirdre is driving, and Larry -- much to his chagrin -- is in
     the passenger seat, watching her every move.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (very curt)
               Oh shut up...

     IN THE BACK SEAT -

     Sam and Vincent have a MAP spread out.  Vincent is tracing
     Gregor's route so far, and we follow his RED MAGIC MARKER as
     it traces a line up the highway.

                          VINCENT
               He's going north.
                   (circles something on map)
               That's Aix en Provence, where he used the
               phone.

     Sam runs his finger along the length of the highway on the
     map.  Destination: Paris.

                          SAM
                   (making up his mind)
               He's going back.

                          VINCENT
               Not necessarily.  He could go off road at
               any number of places.  He might not even
               be in the country anymore.

                          SAM
               It's Paris.  The route's too indirect for
               anything else.  A guy like Gregor, he
               doesn't waste time on this road unless he
               has to be on it in the first place.
               Otherwise, he'd be out of the country by
               now.  He's going to Paris.
                   (beat)
               Now I just hope we can find him before he
               gets there.

                          DEIRDRE
               If somebody else doesn't find him first.

     EXT. THE TOWN OF ORANGE - DAY

     Orange, pronounced "Au-Ronge", is a mid-sized town of fifty
     thousand souls.  It is small, charming, quaint, and it has
     one particular thing that no other town in France can claim -

     AN ANCIENT ROMAN THEATER that has been painstakingly
     restored.  We see this Roman Theater from the outside, as we
     MOVE THROUGH the streets of the town, to the TOWN SQUARE.
     It's packed -- every seat in every outdoor cafe is filled
     with a tourist having breakfast.  This normally quiet place
     explodes one month out of the year, when an internationally
     famous music festival is held in the Roman Theater.  We come
     upon -

     A TABLE OF AMERICAN TOURISTS: a Family.  Dad is angry at Mom.

                          DAD
               Opera?  This is an opera festival?

                          MOM
               I told you that, Henry.

                          DAD
               I thought you meant Phantom of the Opera.
               You know, Andrew Lloyd Weber, Cats, that
               kind of thing.

     Mom and Dad continue their discussion, but we've left them
     behind, MOVING THROUGH the seats and cafes until we get to a
     cafe on the outskirts of the Town Square.  Here, in the most
     removed table in the entire Square, we find Gregor sitting in
     the shadow of the trellis.  Unless you're on top of him you
     can't see him, but he can see everything perfectly.  His cell
     phone sits on the table in front of him -- he picks it up and
     starts to punch in a number.

     CUT TO:

     EXT. A REST STOP ON THE HIGHWAY - MEANWHILE

     THE CITROEN is parked among a number of other cars.  Sam is
     sleeping in the back seat, while Vincent is seen on an
     outdoor pay phone at the other end of the parking lot.
     Deirdre and Larry sit at a nearby picnic table, eating French
     fast food, which we get a good look at as we - PAN THE LENGTH
     OF THE TABLE, which is covered with pasta, grilled sausages
     with dijon mustard, really good fried potatoes.

     In fact, everything that's on this table is so far beyond the
     imagination of your average American truck driver that Larry
     can't contain himself.  He's stuffing himself, washing
     everything down with the wine which is also sold at these
     road-side rest stops.  Deirdre drinks coffee.

                          LARRY
                   (mouth full)
               This...this is incredible. Is the rest
               of Europe like this?

                          DEIRDRE
                   (with a laugh)
               Some places, not all.  Italy, for
               instance, they're serious about their
               food.  But try bloody Britain, anywhere
               in the U.K., you don't get much fancier
               than a deep-fried bar egg.  Food's not
               our thing, you see.

                          LARRY
               What is?

                          DEIRDRE
                   (everybody knows this)
               Best beer in the world known to man or
               God.

                          LARRY
                   (with a snort)
               Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for
               me, thanks.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (with unconcealed scorn)
               Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and
               you've the unbridled gall to mention
               Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's
               not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor
               excuse for rabbit piss.

                          LARRY
               Oh yeah?  Whatta you drink, then?

                          DEIRDRE
               I drink what every civilized man, woman
               and child in the world drinks: Guinness.

                          VINCENT (O.S.)
               I hate to interrupt a conversation of
               such cultural depth...

     CUT AWAY TO REVEAL: Vincent -

     Who has finished his phone call and returned to join them.

                          VINCENT
               ...but we've got to get back on the road.

     Vincent raps lightly on the car window next to Sam's head --
     Sam's eyes shoot open: a light sleeper.  All eyes are on
     Vincent, who waits for a BEAT before he reveals his news.

                          VINCENT
               We've got him.

                          LARRY
               I'm driving.

     EXT. THE TOWN SQUARE - A LITTLE LATER - DAY

     Gregor is seated where we saw him last -- at the little table
     in the corner cafe.  He's been here for hours, observing the
     Town Square, and now, he finally sees what he's been looking
     for - TWO MEN, definitely not tourists here for the music,
     have entered the Square -- everything about these guys
     screams GUNMEN.  Now, as Gregor watches - A PUNKED-OUT TEEN
     comes up to the men and hands them a small envelope.  The
     Gunmen look around the Square, trying to see where Gregor is,
     but he's too far back in the shadows.  The Gunmen ask the
     Teen a question, to which the Teen can only shrug his
     shoulders.  Now - The Teen walks away, leaving the Gunmen to
     open the envelope and look at its contents, which are quickly
     read.  From OFF SCREEN we hear the sound of Gregor punching
     in a number on his cell phone.  Simultaneously, the Gunmen
     finish reading the instructions Gregor has sent them, and
     turn around to face - A PAY PHONE.  The phone rings, and one
     of the Gunmen goes to pick it up.

     EXT. ANOTHER STREET - MEANWHILE

     The Citroen pulls into town and slows to a crawl, cruising
     the streets, looking for Gregor.

     INT. THE CITROEN - SAME TIME

     Vincent stares out of the window and sees something that
     causes him to swear under his breath in French.  It's -

     The Gunmen walking down the street.

                          VINCENT
               I know those men.

     Sam frowns: he also seems to recognize at least one of the
     gunmen.  None of the others in the car notice Sam's reaction,
     but we do.  The Gunmen are heading straight for -

     EXT. THE ANCIENT ROMAN THEATER - MEANWHILE

     THE MID-AFTERNOON SUN shines down on the open air Roman
     Theater.  The theater itself is almost two thousand year
     old.  A semi-circle of seats surrounds a huge Stage Wall, a
     massive structure which is one of the best preserved of its
     kind in the world.  THE GUNMEN enter at the bottom of the
     theater, holding ticket stubs.  They are with a Tour Group
     led by an ANCIENT GEEZER who speaks in rapid-fire French.  As
     the tour moves off to see the Stage Wall, the Gunmen hang
     back and then separate from the crowd.

     EXT. OUTSIDE THE THEATER - SAME TIME

     THE CITROEN sits at a curb.  Larry sits behind the wheel of
     the car, the getaway driver with the motor running.  Vincent
     and Deirdre are already walking towards the Theater.  Sam
     stays behind for a second to say something to Larry.

                          SAM
               Whatever you hear, whatever happens, when
               your partners come back out, you make
               sure you're here with the motor running.

     And on that note Sam follows after Vincent and Deirdre.
     Larry doesn't notice it, but - THE WATCHER has found them.
     He's a block or so away, wearing a two-day stubble of beard
     and hugging the shadows of back alley.  Cradled in one hand,
     barely visible but ominously present: his knife, which for
     one moment catches a glint of sun that hits our eyes as we -

     CUT TO:

     EXT. INSIDE THE ROMAN THEATER - MEANWHILE

     The Gunmen have reached a point about midway up the coliseum-
     like staircase.  Behind them we can see the Tour Group,
     standing on the stage, being lectured to by the Ancient
     Geezer.  In front of them the Gunmen find -

     AN EXIT which leads to an interior hall.  Inside the exit
     it's dark, while a bright sun falls down on the Gunmen.  They
     look into the dark, unable to see a thing, while a voice
     come at them from out of the dark.

                          GREGOR (V.O.)
               Thank you, gentleman, that will do
               nicely.

     IN THE HALL -

     ON GREGOR.  It's dark in here.  There are no lights, no
     torches.  From the dark in here, he can look out and see -
     THE GUNMEN, who make plain targets, backlit as they are by
     the sun.  Now we CUT BACK AND FORTH between these two ANGLES,
     and it becomes clear that Gregor has chosen wisely -- he can
     see his quarry, but they can't see him.

                          GREGOR
               Edvard, is that you?

     EDVARD, the more dangerous looking of the two Gunmen
     responds.

                          EDVARD
               Yes, Gregor, they sent me.

                          GREGOR
               I'm touched, really, that they'd send
               someone of your caliber.  It's nice to
               know that they didn't make the mistake of
               underestimating me twice.

                          EDVARD
               That was a mistake, trying to kill you.
               Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd
               have never allowed it.

                          GREGOR
               I'm sure.  But I'm sorry to say that it's
               too late for trust: we have a serious
               problem.

                               EDVARD
               We'll double your price.

                          GREGOR
                   (now that's interesting)
               Really?  Do you have the money with you?

                          EDVARD
               Do you have the material?

                          GREGOR
               You first, Edvard.

                          EDVARD
               Perhaps we could both go at the same
               time...

                          GREGOR
                   (a short laugh)
               I think not.
                   (with a flourish)
               After you...

     A GUN COMES INTO FRAME, trigger cocked, the barrel placed to
     Gregor's temple.

                          SAM (O.S.)
               After you, asshole.

     Gregor stiffens, as we PULL BACK ON Sam, who has snuck up on
     Gregor and gotten the drop on him.

                          SAM
               You might have been one mean technical
               spook, Gregor, but you wouldn't have
               lasted a week in the field.

     CUT TO THE GUNMEN'S POV: Looking into the Tunnel - It's dark,
     they can't see a thing, but they've heard Sam's voice and
     they know something's wrong.

                          EDVARD
               Gregor, are you alright?

                          DEIRDRE (O.S.)
               Gregor's fine...

     CUT AWAY TO REVEAL: Deirdre -

     She's snuck up on the Gunmen, weapon drawn.

                          DEIDRE
                   (continuing)
               ...but I think you're in a bit of
               trouble.

     The Gunmen reach for their pieces and as they do -

                          VINCENT (O.S.)
               Don't even think it.

     CUT AWAY TO REVEAL: Vincent - And his piece is also out --
     the Gunmen are trapped, and they know it.  Now we notice that
     - The Ancient Geezer and his Tour Group are coming towards
     us.  Meanwhile, back in -

     THE TUNNEL -

     Sam is grilling Gregor furiously, his gun still to Gregor's
     head.

                          SAM
               Don't talk to me unless you tell me what
               I want to hear, understand?!?  You have
               no choice in this, don't think about
               winning, think about staying alive.  I
               want the item, and if you don't give it
               to me, I'm gonna kill you.

                          GREGOR
                   (a panicky hiss)
               I don't have it with me...

                          SAM
               Bullshit!

                          GREGOR
               I swear...

                          SAM
               Then where is it?

                          GREGOR
               I sent it to myself in Paris.

                          SAM
               Sent it where?

                          GREGOR
               A post office box.

     Suddenly Gregor runs forward, towards the exit.  Sam runs
     after him, tackling him just as they reach - THE OUTSIDE,
     where the two men roll into plain sight of - The Gunmen, who
     are still covered by Vincent and Deirdre.  Now we notice -
     That the Ancient Geezer and his Tour Group are really close,
     no more than ten yards away, as - Sam has Gregor pinned face
     first on the ancient stone of the theater.  He looks up at
     the others, and that's when it happens - Edvard looks at Sam
     and recognizes him.

                          EDVARD
                   (stunned, announcing to the
                    group)
               Do you know who he is?  He's with
               Interpol, the Internation Police.  He's
               a cop.

     A SLOW MOTION BEAT.

     Vincent and Deirdre don't know what to make of this, their
     heads turn to look at Sam, and in this instant - The Tour
     Group walks into their midst and - The 2nd Gunman reaches for
     his piece and - Sam FIRES his gun at the 2nd Gunman, and with
     the sharp report of the pistol we move back to REAL TIME, as -
     The Crowd panics, screaming, and now Edvard is reaching for
     his weapon, as - Sam shoots again, killing the 2nd Gunman,
     and now - The Crowd is still screaming and running as -
     Gregor shoves through the crowd into the exit, as -

     Deirdre pushes through the crowd, and now she's made it into
     the tunnel.  Now we go -

     OUTSIDE THE THEATER -

     Where Larry has heard the shot -- his piece is drawn, but
     he's been ordered to stay in the car.  In frustration he
     slams on the steering wheel, as we see that - Behind Larry,
     the Watcher is slowly closing in, knife poised to strike as
     we go back -

     INTO THE THEATER -

     Edvard tries to get to the exit, but there are too many
     Tourists in his way, and he proceeds to shoot several of
     them, including the Dad we saw earlier.  Seconds later,
     Edvard has vanished into the tunnels, and now - Vincent and
     Sam meet in the middle of the crowd.  There is time for a
     QUICK BEAT, while Vincent glares at Sam.

                          VINCENT
               You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I
               should kill you.

                          SAM
               But you can't.

     And now Sam runs into the tunnel, after the others, leaving
     Vincent for a fraction of a second to sigh, and then follow
     Sam into -

     THE TUNNELS -

     It's like being in the tunnels and ramps of a sporting arena.
     Except that everything here is made of stone and the only
     light comes from the sun which streams in through the exit
     openings which are spaced far enough apart that they provide
     just barely enough light for us to see.  Now we do a SERIES
     OF QUICK CUTS - Sam running, followed by - Vincent, while -
     Edvard takes a wrong turn down a dark hall and comes to a
     dead end.  He turns around, looking for a way out as - Gregor
     sees the final exit ahead of him as we go -

     OUT IN THE STREET - Larry is still behind the wheel of the
     Citroen, anxiously looking at the exit, not realizing that -
     The Watches is almost on him, and now we're back -

     IN THE TUNNELS -

     Deirdre comes running around a corner, and now she's almost
     reached the exit as -

     OUT IN THE STREET -

     Gregor hits the street running.  He doesn't notice the
     Citroen parked ahead, because he's never seen it before, but
     as he runs by -

     The car door swings open and Gregor runs straight into it.
     He smashes into the door and falls to the ground, injured.
     Strong Hands reach out of the car and pull him in.  It's the
     Watcher, and let's give him a name now because he needs one:
     SEAMUS REILLY.  Seated in the front seat is - A very dead
     Larry.  Seamus has cut his throat from ear to ear.

                          SEAMUS
                   (to Gregor, with an Irish
                    accent)
               If you want to live you'll do exactly as
               I tell you.

     THROUGH THE BACK WINDOW - Deirdre appears, exiting the
     theater and running towards the Citroen as we go back to -

     INT. THE TUNNELS - SAME TIME

     Vincent, gun drawn, moves warily down one of the tunnels.
     Outside we can hear the dim sound of an approaching siren.
     Vincent turns a corner and - A GUN jams itself into his face.
     It's Edvard.

                          EDVARD
               Where do I know you from?

                          VINCENT
               Vienna.

                          EDVARD
               Of course...I remember.  I quite liked
               you, I'm sorry to have to do this.

     Edvard's finger tightens around the trigger, when -

                          SAM (O.S.)
               Hey...

     Edvard is startled by the sound of Sam's voice.  Even as he
     squeezes off the shot, Edvard turns to look at Sam, and as he
     does so, Vincent strikes out at the gun, sending the shot
     awry, causing it to - RICOCHET wildly, whining around the
     room, until it - Rips through Sam's side, a nasty wound but
     not fatal, as - Edvard tries to fire another shot but it's
     too late, because - Vincent fires a single shot to the head
     that kills Edvard.

     EXT. OUTSIDE THE THEATER - MEANWHILE

     Deirdre has reached the Citroen.  She looks in and sees
     Seamus and Gregor.  Lastly she looks at the dead Larry.  She
     sighs in disgust, but otherwise doesn't react as if
     surprised.

                          DEIRDRE
               Cold cocking the poor son-of-a-bitch
               would have sufficed, Seamus, don't you
               think?

     SCANT SECOND LATER -

     Larry's body hits the street as the Citroen drives off,
     Deirdre behind the wheel just as - Sam and Vincent run out of
     the theater, with Vincent helping a wounded Sam who bleeds
     from the wound in his side.  They arrive at the street only
     to see - Larry, lying dead in the street, even as the Citroen
     speeds away from them, turning the corner before they can
     even think to raise their guns.

                          VINCENT
               That double-crossing bitch.

     Sam isn't even capable of saying that much -- he just stares
     after the departed Citroen with a look on his face unlike any
     we've seen in the film: "how the hell did that happen?"  But
     there's no time to ponder this because they've been joined by
     - A COP.  He's a local guy, he directs traffic and busts
     drunks in the town square -- and he's scared shitless,
     holding his gun in both hands, trying not to tremble, as he
     stares back at - TWO GUNS, Sam's and Vincent's, and they're
     both pointed at the Cop.  LONG BEAT.  In the way off distance,
     another siren can just be heard.  Sam and Vincent glare at
     the Cop, who strains with all his might to control himself,
     but he can't because Sam and Vincent are death waiting to be
     served.  The cop knows he has three seconds to make up his
     mind.  Two.  One.  The Cop puts his gun on the ground and
     steps back, raising his hands in the air.  Now - Sam and
     Vincent stumble into the street, and are instantly almost hit
     by - A CAR speeding around the corner, its Driver oblivious
     to what's going on.  The car screeches to a halt, and the
     Driver curses loudly in French.  And then the next thing the
     Driver knows - A Gun is in his face.  The door is yanked open
     and the Driver is yanked out, as we -

     CUT TO:

     EXT. A BACK ROAD - LATER/EARLY EVENING

     The town of Orange is just visible below us as the
     commandeered Car drives up into the hills.  Vincent is behind
     the wheel, while the wounded Sam sits in the passenger seat.
     Gritting his teeth, Sam peels back his shirt to get a look at
     - THE WOUND, and it's small but bad -- the ricochet ripped a
     small raw hole in Sam's side.  The wound bleeds, but
     moderately so -- no major organs or arteries have been hit.

                          VINCENT
               That makes twice now you've saved my
               life.

                          SAM
               I didn't save your life back there.
               Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save
               shit.

                          VINCENT
               You see it your way, I'll see it mine.
               You need a doctor.

                          SAM
                   (hopeful)
               You know one around here?  Somebody you
               trust?

                          VINCENT
               No...I thought I'd take you to the
               hospital.

                          SAM
                   (sharply)
               No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I
               have to.

                          VINCENT
                   (he can't believe this)
               Fix it yourself?
                   (a thought comes to him)
               Why are we even doing this?  There's no
               need to run, Christ...
                   (he can't disguise his disgust)
               You're a cop.

                          SAM
               Not exactly.

                          VINCENT
               You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.

                          SAM
               If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have
               busted you a long time ago.  This isn't
               about you, it's about the job I have to
               do.

                          VINCENT
               And what job is that?

                          SAM
               My job, Vincent, a job you don't need to
               know about.  I can't go to the local cops
               -- they'd never be able to get close
               enough at this point.  It's me or nobody,
               and I've been on this job too goddamned
               long not to finish.

     BEAT.  Sam takes out his own pack of cigarettes, offers one
     to Vincent and takes another for himself.  They smoke for a
     second, before Vincent speaks.

                          VINCENT
               It looks to me like we're all that's left
               of our group.

                          SAM
               We?  There is no we in my world now,
               Vincent, just me.

                          VINCENT
               I'm going with you.

                          SAM
               This doesn't involve you, don't you
               understand?  I can't even guarantee you
               any money out of all this.

                          VINCENT
               It isn't about money for me, not
               anymore.

                          SAM
               You don't have to do this.

                          VINCENT
                   (with great finality)
               Yes I do.

     Sam gives Vincent a look and shakes his head in disbelief --
     Vincent's loyalty and sense of honor is something he's never
     seen before, and Sam can only smoke in silence and consider
     this as we -

     CUT TO:

     INT. A CHEAP BACK ROOM - NIGHT

     A PEEPHOLE slides open, and we look through it into -

     INT. AN ADJOINING ROOM

     where Gregor sits, bound and gagged in a chair, his eyes wide
     with fright.  Now - The Peephole snicks shut, and Deirdre
     turns to face Seamus Reilly.

                          DEIRDRE
               When we're done with this, I want to do
               for that one myself.

                          SEAMUS
               Now there's the Deirdre I know.

                          DEIRDRE
               And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus
               Reilly?

                          SEAMUS
               It means I was worried that all the time
               you spent away from the fold might have
               affected you.  You've been living the
               life of the hired gun -- the well paid
               hired gun, I might note.  There's no
               glory to it, but there are those that
               like it.

                          DEIRDRE
               So you thought that maybe I'd grown too
               attached to this charade I've been
               playing, is that it?

                          SEAMUS
               It's been known to happen.

                          DEIRDRE
               Not to me, you know that.

                          SEAMUS
                   (goading her)
               I thought I did.

     Seamus's taunt works: Deirdre whips out her gun and puts it
     to his head.

                          DEIRDRE
               I guess you don't know me, then, if you
               think I won't kill you for an insult like
               that!

     Seamus glares at Deirdre for a moment, and she glares back at
     him until he starts to laugh.

                          SEAMUS
               Just testing, lass.  Forgive me, but I
               had to do it.

     Deirdre glares a moment more and then puts away her gun.

                          DEIRDRE
               Remember what we agreed on, Seamus: when
               we get home, I don't play "the girl"
               again.

     Deirdre gives Seamus a look to make sure this last point is
     clear and we -

     CUT TO:

     EXT. A FARMHOUSE - THE COUNTRY - NIGHT

     The Stolen Car parks behind a BARN, and Sam and Vincent get
     out.  Waiting for them is a friend of Vincent's - JEAN-
     PIERRE, a Frenchman in his forties, hearty, burly, friendly.

                          VINCENT
               Hello, Jean-Pierre.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Hello, my friend.
                   (with a look at Sam)
               He doesn't look French to me, Vincent.

                          SAM
               American.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Well, Vincent's American friend, shall we
               see what we can do for you?

     INT. THE FARMHOUSE KITCHEN - LATER/NIGHT

     SURGICAL IMPLEMENTS - Are laid out on a clean cloth.
     Scalpel, forceps, a clamp, a sponge, medical thread and
     needles.  We PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Sam, stretched out on the
     kitchen table.  Around him we see - Vincent and Jean-Pierre,
     who are wearing rubber gloves and examining Sam's wound.
     Jean-Pierre holds a mirror up so that Sam can see what's
     going on.  Sam, with his medical training, is treating
     himself.

                          VINCENT
                   (to Sam)
               It's right there, beneath the surface.  I
               can just make it out.

     Sam is in terrible pain, but necessity dictates that he focus
     on what's going on so that he can talk Vincent through this
     next procedure.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Are you sure you won't have a drink?

                          SAM
                   (sharply)
               No booze...Pain's in the mind, and the
               mind I can control.
                   (quick beat)
               Alright, let's do it.

     During this next sequence, we CUT BACK AND FORTH between
     Sam's reactions to the surgery, and the mirror itself where
     he's watching.

                          SAM
               Douse the wound with alcohol.

     Vincent pours a healthy splash of rubbing alcohol onto the
     wound and - Sam grits his teeth as the pain explodes up his
     central nervous system.

                          SAM
                   (to Jean-Pierre)
               Take that sponge and wipe away as much of
               the blood as you can, keep it clean so I
               can see.

     Jean-Pierre does as Sam says, wiping away the blood that
     keeps filling the wound.  Throughout the procedure Jean-
     Pierre will do this; every time the sponge is saturated he
     squeezes the excess blood into - A BUCKET which sits on the
     floor, slowly filling up with drippings from the sponge.

                          SAM
                   (to Vincent)
               Take the clamp...

     Vincent picks up the clamp.

                          SAM
               Peel back the skin and attach the clamp.

     Vincent attaches the clamp to Sam's wound.  It takes perhaps
     fifteen seconds, and everyone of those seconds is agonizing
     for Sam.  He sweats, he grits his teeth, he grunts the
     smallest of grunts.  But he doesn't move.  Finally Vincent is
     done.

                          VINCENT
               Alright, it's done.

                          SAM
               You see the bullet?

                          VINCENT
               Clearly.

                          SAM
               Good.  Now take the forceps, and
               remember, Vincent, what we're doing here
               is routine.  I've done stuff like this at
               least twenty times in the field.  There
               are no vital organs where you're working,
               no major muscles or arteries -- you can't
               kill me.  Just make sure you've got the
               bullet before you try to pull it out.

     Vincent probes the wound with the forceps.  This takes
     probably thirty seconds, and it hurts even more then when the
     clamp was attached.

     Several times - Vincent seems to have the bullet in his
     grasp, but it slips, and each time it slips - Sam makes the
     smallest of noises, as if to indicate the level of the pain.
     Finally - The forceps firmly grasp the bullet, and with a
     single tug, Vincent extracts it.

                          VINCENT
                   (holding the bullet aloft)
               A souvenir...

     He tosses the bullet through the air, and we FOLLOW IT IN
     SLOW MOTION as it lands in - A SAUCER, which sits on the
     kitchen counter.  We're back in REAL TIME, as the bullet
     rolls around the plate for a second before coming to a halt.
     Now - Sam breathes the hugest of sighs, and his face relaxes.
     Instantly, Vincent puts a lighted cigarette in Sam's mouth,
     and he drags deeply on it.

                          SAM
                   (to Vincent)
               You think you can stitch me up on you
               own?

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Don't worry, we'll take care of it.

                          SAM
               Then if you don't mind...
                   (he hands the cigarette back to
                    Vincent)
               I'm gonna pass out.

     And that's exactly what he does.

     A TIME CUT TO:

     INT. FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

     Vincent and Jean-Pierre sit on easy chairs.  An open bottle
     of wine sits between them, a FIRE burns in the fireplace, and
     they smoke in a contented silence for a moment.  When they
     speak, it is in FRENCH, with ENGLISH SUBTITLES.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               He's tough, your American friend.

                          VINCENT
               Yes, Sam's tough alright.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               And you respect him.

                          VINCENT
               Of course.  Don't you?

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               I've never seen a man who could have
               taken what he just went through.
                   (beat)
               He's a cop?

                          VINCENT
                   (beat, trying to find a way to
                    say it)
               Not exactly.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?
                   (beat)
               So he saved your life, then?

                          VINCENT
               How did you know?

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               If he hadn't you'd have put a bullet in
               his head a long time ago.

     Both men stare back into the fireplace and we HOLD FOR A BEAT
     before we -

     DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. THE FARM - KITCHEN - DAWN

     Sam is awake.  Pale from the loss of blood, he moves softly
     around the kitchen, searching professionally for something,
     giving the moment a slightly dangerous feel because he seems
     so intent on what he's doing and then he finds it - THE
     COFFEE.

     TEN MINUTES LATER -

     A stream of Hot Coffee migles with a stream of Steamed Milk.

     EXT. THE FARMHOUSE PORCH - SUNRISE

     A STEAMING CUT OF COFFEE sits in Sam's hands as he lights a
     cigarette to go with the coffee.  He sits on an ancient
     chair, smoking in silence, looking out at - THE WOODS around
     the house, and this place is postcard-beautiful, the French
     Farmhouse you see only in pictures.  But Sam's mind is
     elsewhere, he's staring into space, lost in thought.

                          JEAN-PIERRE (O.S.)
               You're feeling better?

     ANOTHER ANGLE - Jean-Pierre stands in the open front door of
     the farmhouse, with a cup of coffee.  Now, Jean-Pierre moves
     out to join Sam, sitting down on another chair opposite him.

                          SAM
                   (responding to the question)
               Some, thanks.  Enough to move on, for
               now.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
                   (pointing at Sam's wounded
                    side)
               You should really let a doctor look at
               that.

                          SAM
               Soon.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               But first you have something to take care
               of?

                          SAM
               Yeah.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Something important?  A thing that cannot
               wait?

                          SAM
               It gets done now or not at all.  Another
               couple of days and the parties concerned are
               gone where I can't get them.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Forgive my intrusion into your affairs,
               but I am the one who connected Vincent to
               this job, his agent, if you will.  He is
               one of my oldest friends and I owe him a
               great debt, much like the debt I suspect
               he owes you.

     A QUICK CUT TO:

     INSIDE THE FARMHOUSE

     Where Vincent has just poured himself a cup of coffee and lit
     a very satisfying cigarette when he hears the voices from
     outside.

                          SAM (O.S.)
               Vincent doesn't owe me a thing.

     Vincent looks up when he hears his name and he moves towards
     the sound of the voices.

                          JEAN-PIERRE (O.S.)
               He sees this differently, as you well
               know.

                          SAM (O.S.)
               I didn't expect that he would.

     BACK ON THE PORCH -

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               You suffered through an agonizing pain
               last night, pain you could have avoided
               by declaring yourself an agent of the
               law.

                          SAM
               Vincent told you that I'm a cop?

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Not a word.  But no ordinary criminal
               would have the extensive military and
               medical expertise you do.  And so I place
               the pieces of the puzzle together in a
               way that makes sense to me.  You work for
               some government agency and you carry a
               gun, and in my world, that makes you a
               cop.

     And now Jean-Pierre produces a LONG BARRELED REVOLVER which
     he places loosely in his lap -- a gesture which seems to say,
     "you'd better explain things to my satifaction or we're
     gonna have a problem."  Sam notices the weapon, but he
     doesn't react overtly.

                          SAM
               So this is what, a test?

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Call it a reckoning of character.

     BEAT.  Sam looks at the Revolver again.

                          SAM
               If I was healthy, I could take that away
               from you.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Perhaps.  But you are not healthy, and if
               you try I'll kill you.

     QUICK CUT TO: Vincent - Who stands inside the house, out of
     sight, but not out of ear shot.  He's listening to
     everything, and we notice that Vincent has taken out his
     own gun.

     BACK ON Jean-Pierre and Sam.  By now Jean-Pierre has raised
     the pistol.  He doesn't point it at Sam, but his finger cocks
     the hammer.

                          SAM
               So what is it you want to know?

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               I suppose I want to know how a man like
               you is created.

                          SAM
               Created?

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like
               steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern
               Samurai.  I've spent my life around
               extraordinary men -- men like Vincent.
               But I've never seen anyone like you.
                   (beat)
               I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes
               with you.

                          SAM
               Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll
               have to carry it for himself.  And I'm
               not any kind of Samurai.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               You seem one to me.

                          SAM
               A Samurai has honor, a Samurai live by
               the code of Bushido, the way of the
               warrior.  I'm just a killer for hire.
                   (beat)
               The world isn't about honor, anymore.
               It's about survival.

     LONG BEAT.  Something in Sam's speech touches Jean-Pierre.
     He relaxes his finger on the hammer.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Survival.  I suppose that's as good a
               cause as any.

     BACK ON Vincent - Who relaxes his grip on his gun. BACK ON
     Sam and Jean-Pierre - And we're PULLING BACK, AWAY from the
     Farmhouse, which glows in the morning sun as we -

     DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. A PARIS STREET - DAY

     A BLACK COMPACT CAR sits in front of a Parisian Post Office.
     Inside the car, behind the wheel, we see Deirdre.  Now,
     coming out of the Post Office, we see - Gregor and Seamus
     Reilly.  Seamus has a coat slung over his arm, hiding the gun
     which he keeps pressed to Gregor's side.  There's no sign of
     the Briefcase as Seamus and Gregor get into -

     INT. THE CAR - SAM TIME

     THUNK!  The door slams shut.  Gregor and Seamus are in the
     back seat.  Almost instantly Seamus angrily snaps a pair of
     handcuffs on Gregor.  Immediately, Deirdre pulls out.

                          DEIRDRE
               Where's the case?

                          GREGOR
                   (nervous)
               There's a problem...

                          SEAMUS
                   (jumping all over him)
               Problem my ass!  I think you're lying to
               me, and if you are you're a dead man!

                          DEIRDRE
               Would somebody tell me what fucking well
               happened in there?

                          SEAMUS
                   (disgusted)
               Nothing.

                          GREGOR
                   (eager to explain)
               The package didn't come.  I'm sure it
               will tomorrow.

     Suddenly Seamus seems to lose it.  He grabs Gregor and slams
     a gun against his head.

                          SEAMUS
                   (he's almost foaming at the
                    mouth)
               If you're lying to me you poor excuse for
               a human being, I'm gonna blow your brains
               all over this car.

                          GREGOR
                   (beyond desperate)
               I swear, it has to come here!  It has
               to...

     BEAT.  For one tension-filled moment, we think Seamus is
     going to splash Gregor's brains all over the place.  But then
     he smiles, puts his weapon away, and pats Gregor gently on
     the face.

                          SEAMUS
               Ease up, man...I'm just checking to make
               sure you're on the level.

     Gregor is beyond speech -- he can only whimper.

                          SEAMUS
               And it seems to me I saw a sign in there
               that says they got a late afternoon
               delivery.  Why don't we come back later
               today and do this all over again, huh?

     Seamus smiles a smile that is more than a little bit
     sadistic.  Neither Gregor nor Deirdre smiles in return as we -

     CUT TO:

     EXT. ANOTHER STREET - PARIS - DAY

     THE EIFFEL TOWER fills our eyes.  And then we PULL BACK TO
     REVEAL that it's a tacky, flyblown poster on a dingy street.
     And now we're -

     MOVING DOWN the Street, until we come to a store whose sign
     advertises in English - HONG KONG MOVIES.  The windows of the
     store are filled with posters.  We MOVE THROUGH TO

     INT. THE STORE - SAME TIME

     TONY SIMON, an expatriate black American, runs this place and
     lives above it.  His shelves are lined with action films made
     in the Far East.  Tony knows everything there is to know
     about the films he sells -- but he also knows quite a bit
     about what's going on in the Parisian Underworld.  he's a
     professional information broker.  Right now he's talking to a
     CUSTOMER in perfect French, with English Subtitles.

                          TONY
               Hey, man, they're both great movies.  One
               is more of a character study, the other
               is more of a straight action thing, but
               they're great movies, and he's an amazing
               fucking filmmaker.

     Tony looks up and sees something that catches his attention.

                          TONY
               Excuse me...

     Vincent and Sam have entered the store.  Sam's ability to be
     back on his feet in such a short time is amazing -- but we
     can see that he's not the same guy he was at the start of the
     film.  what he does from here on in he does by sheer force of
     will.  Now - Tony moves to join them, and the conversation
     immediately turns to English.

                          TONY
                   (to Vincent)
               My man, how you doing?

                          VINCENT
               I'm alright.  And you?

                          TONY
               Doing well.
                   (with a look at Sam)
               This is?

                          VINCENT
               A friend.  I was telling him about how
               you always have the latest tapes.

                          TONY
               Why don't we step into my office...

     Tony's office, it turns out, is the area behind the COUNTER.
     Tony raises a section of the counter that allows him to get
     to the other side, and then he closes it behind him.

                          TONY
               So what can I do for you?

     Vincent checks out the store before he starts speaking.  The
     place is empty except for - The single Customer Tony was just
     talking to.  The Customer is still considering the two films
     Tony was showing him.

                          VINCENT
               I was wondering if you had any movies
               that were particularly new.

                          TONY
               Matter of face there's this flick I've
               been hearing about.  I haven't seen it,
               but from what I hear it's pretty cool.

                          SAM
               What's the story?

                          TONY
               It's an international thing.  Several
               different peoples involved, criminals
               from all over the world, experts brought
               together to do a job.  But maybe the most
               interesting thing about it is that
               preeminent in the plot we find the
               Russian Mob and the IRA in bed together.
               An unlikely group of partners.

                          VINCENT
               Do you have the tape?

                          TONY
               I might know where you could get a copy.

     The Customer approaches the counter.  He has both tapes with
     him.

                          TONY
                   (to Vincent and Sam)
               Let me do some business with my boy here,
               and I'll meet you across the street in
               five.  I gotta make homes here feel like
               he's getting a good deal while I give him
               the pleasure of overpaying me for a
               couple of second generation pirates.

     EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

     The Customer exits, smiling and carrying his tapes -- what a
     great fucking deal he just got!  A few seconds later, Tony
     comes out and locks up the store front.  He crosses the
     street towards -

     INT. A FALAFEL JOINT - A FEW MINUTES AFTER THAT

     A HUGE FALAFEL drips lettuce and tahini sauce from its end.
     We PULL BACK ON - Tony, who's just taken a bite out of the
     falafel.  He sits at a table in the back with Vincent and
     Sam.

                          TONY
                   (his mouth full)
               What I've heard so far, it's all a lot of
               talk.  I wasn't so sure what to make of
               it at first, cause, like I said, the
               Irish and the Russians are an unlikely
               mix.

                          VINCENT
               You said you might know where we can get
               a copy of this tape?

                          TONY
               All depends on whether you want the
               Russian or the Gaelic language version.

                          SAM
                   (instantly)
               Gaelic.

                          TONY
               You sure?

                          SAM
               I'm sure.

                          VINCENT
                   (to Tony)
               Can you get it?

                          TONY
               The Russian would be easier.

                          SAM
               Why's that?

                          TONY
               Cause the Russian production company
               would be easier to find.

                          SAM
               It's the Irish tape we want.

                          TONY
                   (with a sigh)
               Gonna be tough.

     Tony scribbles something on a piece of paper.

                          TONY
               Last I heard there was a film rep for the
               Irish players staying at this address,
               name of Seamus Reilly.

                          SAM
                   (repeating it, he knows this
                    name)
               Seamus Reilly.

                          VINCENT
                   (to Sam)
               You know him?

                          SAM
               I know of him.

                          TONY
               Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish
               Auteur -- a real firebrand.  Thinks his
               more moderate filmmaking brethren have
               turned to making movies for peace-loving
               pussies, if you see what I'm saying.

                          VINCENT
               I get the picture.

     Sam reaches for the piece of paper, but Vincent puts his hand
     on top of it.

                          VINCENT
               Tony and I have to talk some business,
               first.

                          TONY
               I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to
               moan about the price, we settle somewhere
               in the middle.

                          VINCENT
               It's a matter of respect.
                   (to Sam)
               Why don't you wait outside, this won't
               take long.

     Sam smiles slightly and rises from the table, moving towards
     the exit.  Behind him in rapid-fire French, Tony and Vincent
     are now discussing the price of the information.  They are
     both loud and abusive, and obviously they're enjoying
     themselves immensely.

     EXT. THE FALAFEL SHOP - A LITTLE LATER - DAY

     Vincent exits the shop and gets into -

     INT. THE PEUGEOT

     Where Sam sits in the passenger seat as Vincent slides behind
     the wheel.  Vincent tosses Sam a piece of paper.

                          SAM
               The Irish representative?

                          VINCENT
               Yes.

     Vincent gives Sam another piece of paper.

                          SAM
               What's this?

                          VINCENT
               The address of the Russian production
               company.  Just in case we need to find
               them.

                          SAM
               Thorough man.

     Vincent starts the car and we -

     CUT TO:

     EXT. A PARIS STREET - LATER - AFTERNOON

     The Peugeot sits, parked at a cub, a discreet distance from -
     AN APARTMENT HOUSE: 35 Rue de Glacon.  We PUSH IN on the -

     INT. THE PEUGEOT - LATE AFTERNOON

     A PIECE OF PAPER scarwled with the same address: 35 de
     Glacon.  We PULL BACK TO REVEAL -

     Sam, holding this paper and looking out at the apartment
     complex.

                          SAM
               You sure your friend got the right place?

                          VINCENT
               If Tony says this is it, then it's it.

     BEAT.  Vincent wants to know something important.

                          VINCENT
               Tell me, Sam: why do you do this?

                          SAM
               Do what?

                          VINCENT
               Continue when it would be so much easier
               to give it up.

                          SAM
               It's my job.

                          VINCENT
               Then quit.
                   (beat)
               You don't work for Interpol, Sam.

                          SAM
               Sure I do.  You heard him, you heard the
               guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard
               said.

                          VINCENT
               It's a cover, then.  A cover within a
               cover, a feint within a feint.
                   (quick beat)
               You work for the CIA, it's the only
               possible answer.

     LONG BEAT.  Sam considers what to say, and then decides he
     owes Vincent the truth.

                          SAM
               I'm a field agent -- last of an already
               extinct breed.  I do dark ops.

                          VINCENT
               Dark ops?

                          SAM
               Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping.
               Assassination.

                          VINCENT
               Very ugly.

                          SAM
               It is at that.

                          VINCENT
               Not very zen of you, huh?  Not so much
               the modern Samurai after all.

                          SAM
               I never made that claim.

                          VINCENT
               I know.  Jean-Pierre did.

                          SAM
               You were behind the door?

                          VINCENT
               I was waiting to see what would happen.
               I didn't want to kill him if I didn't
               have to.

                          SAM
               You would have done that?

                          VINCENT
               I would have tried not to.  But yes, if
               it would have kept him from shooting you,
               I would have.

                          SAM
                   (almost to himself)
               How could you have done that?

                          VINCENT
               Because I owe you.
                   (he sees something)
               Look at that...

     THEIR POV: Through the Windsheild - Deirdre exits the
     apartment building.

                          SAM (O.S.)
                   (quietly exultant)
               All things come to those who wait.

     Now Deirdre is followed by Seamus and Gregor.

                          VINCENT (O.S.)
                   (really surprised by this)
               He's not dead.

     BACK ON Sam and Vincent.

                          SAM
                   (figuring it out)
               They don't have the package.

                          VINCENT
               You think?

                          SAM
               You said it yourself: Gregor's not dead.
               If they had the package, they'd have
               killed him.

     Vincent and Sam exchange a look -- now they both figure it
     out.

                          VINCENT & SAM
                   (simultaneously)
               They're going to get it.

     CUT TO:

     INT. THE POST OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

     A HAND signs a receipt, and we PULL BACK TO REVEAL Gregor at
     a counter, signing for his package, which slides across the
     counter.  It's the Briefcase, although it's been wrapped in
     BROWN PAPER for its journey through the French Postal System.
     Now we see that - Seamus is still right beside Gregor; is, in
     face, almost on top of him, with a hand in his coat pocket
     which lets us know where his gun is.  Now - The two men start
     to move towards the exit as we -

     CUT TO:

     EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE - A MINUTE LATER/LATE AFTERNOON

     The Black Compact Car idles at a nearby curb, with Deirdre
     behind the wheel.  She's staring so intently at the front of
     the post office, that she's surprised when a SHADOW falls
     across her.  She looks up to see - Sam, standing next to the
     car.  Deirdre starts to reach for her weapon, but Sam cuts
     her off with a word.

                          SAM
               Don't do it...

     Something in his voice conveys enough of a threat that she
     backs off.  Now she and Sam exchange a long look.

                          DEIRDRE
               Well, if it isn't Mr. Interpol himself.
                   (she really sounds betrayed)
               I can't believe I misjudged you like I
               did.

                          SAM
               Oh please..you're on some sort of holy
               mission?

                          DEIRDRE
               I'm a patriate.

                          SAM
               Don't even think that I'm buying that.

                          DEIRDRE
               Where do you get off saying word one?
               All the time pretending to be one of us,
               it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus
               and myself.  And here you are so high and
               mighty, like you're so different from the
               rest of us.

                          SAM
               I didn't say I was.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (she sees something)
               Bloody fucking hell...

     CUT AWAY TO: Gregor and Seamus are leaving the post office.
     By now, Seamus has taken the package away from Gregor.
     Unseen by these two men - Vincent is approaching from the
     side, on an intercept course, his hand inside a bag which he
     carries with him.  Now - Deirdre turns and shoots Sam a look.
     He's still watching her keenly, and we can see that she's
     aching to reach for her piece, but she can't because Sam is
     still on her like a hawk.

                          SAM
               Don't even think it.

     He pulls back the folds of his suit jacket, revealing his
     gun, putting his hand comfortably on the pistol grip.

                          SAM
               I'd kill you before you had it halfway
               out.

     Vincent is closing on Gregor and Seamus, another ten seconds
     and he'll have them.

     Now - Deirdre looks back at Sam, then back at the situation
     developing in front of her, and then suddenly - She slams the
     car into gear and drives off, tires squealing while - Sam
     pulls his piece, sighting down the barrel and - He can't do
     it, can't shoot Deirdre.  Now - The sound of the car alerts
     Seamus, who turns in time to see - Vincent, who is raising
     the bag wrapped around his hand as - The car flies directly
     at - Vincent, who if forced to jump out of the way even as he
     pulls the trigger of the gun hidden within the bag.  The end
     of the bag explodes in a burst of fire, but the shots are off
     the mark - Missing Seamus and Gregor as - Vincent rolls out
     of the way, just in time, while - Deirdre brakes the car to a
     screaming halt, as Seamus pushes Gregor in ahead of him and
     then gets in.  Seconds later, the car pulls out, even as -
     Sam drives up in the Peugeot to Vincent, who picks himself up
     off the ground and leaps into the car.  The last thing we
     hear is the sound of Sam's Voice as the Peugeot drives off.

                          SAM (V.O.)
               Put your seatbelt on.

     CUT TO:

     INT./EXT. - CAR CHASE MONTAGE

     During this SEQUENCE, we'll JUMP CUT BETWEEN the two cars and
     the streets they travel through.  Now - The Black Compact Car
     flies down a small street, followed closely by - The Peugeot,
     where Sam is driving as Vincent tries to steady his gun to
     get a clear shot at the other Car.

     INSIDE THE PEUGEOT -

                          VINCENT
               What the fuck happened?

                          SAM
               I don't know...

                          VINCENT
               You don't know?  Bullshit, you had her,
               there was no way out.

     IN THE COMPACT CAR -

     Where Deirdre is driving for dear life, while Seamus is
     freaking out.

                          SEAMUS
               What in bloody hell is going on?

                          DEIRDRE
               They're part of the team.  One of them's
               the guy I told you about.

                          SEAMUS
               From Interpol?

                          DEIRDRE
               That's him.

     IN THE PEUGEOT -

                          VINCENT
               Why didn't you kill her?

     IN THE COMPACT -

                          SEAMUS
               Why didn't you kill him?

     OUT IN THE STREET -

     The two cars SLAM through the traffic, heading for a HIGHWAY
     RAMP which appears now perhaps two blocks away.

     IN THE PEUGEOT -

                          VINCENT
                   (figuring it out)
               You slept with her!

     IN THE COMPACT -

                          SEAMUS
               How is it these fellahs managed to get
               the drop on us?

                          DEIRDRE
               I told you: they're good...

     OUT IN THE STREET -

     THE TWO CARS have reached the highway ramp, and as first one,
     and then the other pulls onto the highway, we PULL BACK AND
     UP TO REVEAL:

     THE PERIFERIQUE -

     The massive and confusing highway system which encircles the
     city of Paris.  Right away we notice that this entrance ramp
     leads to a traffic circle, filled with various off ramps
     which lead to no less than four different sections of the
     Periferique.

     IN THE PEUGEOT -

                          VINCENT
                   (slamming the dashboard in
                    disgust)
               You slept with her!

     IN THE COMPACT -

                          SEAMUS
                   (lecturing Deridre)
               You should have kill him when you had
               the chance.  But no...

     IN THE PEUGEOT -

                          VINCENT
               You put everything on the line because
               you...

     IN THE COMPACT

                          SEAMUS
                   (as if finishing Vincent's
                    sentence)
               You slept with the fucker!!

     ON THE PERIFERIQUE -

     THE PEUGEOT cruising on an upper part of the traffic circle,
     while down below them - THE COMPACT turns towards one of the
     roadways.

                     VINCENT (O.S.)
          Fuck...

     IN THE PEUGEOT -

                          VINCENT
               Left left left!!!

     Sam looks up and sees - Three possible ramps: one to the
     right, one to the center, and one to the - Left.  At the last
     second he takes the left turn as we go back to -

     IN THE COMPACT CAR -

     Where Seamus has turned from lecturing Deirdre to threatening
     Gregor.  Seamus holds the package in one hand and his gun in
     the other.

                          SEAMUS
                   (waving the package)
               This better be the real thing or you're a
               dead man!

                          GREGOR
               It is, I'm telling you it is!!

                          SEAMUS
               You've told me a lot of things, boyo...

     ZING-SHATTER!  A BULLET blows a hole in their back windshield
     as - The Peugeot is catching up, and Vincent is leaning out
     of his window, firing away.  Now - Seamus turns to Deirdre.

                          SEAMUS
               Lose them!

                          DEIRDRE
               You lose them!

     Deirdre swings the wheel wildly, and the Compact takes a
     screaming turn, followed by - The Peugeot, and now they're
     both speeding towards another junction, where several other
     roadways of the Periferique run together.  Now we see that -
     Seamus is returning Vincent's fire, even as - The Junction
     approaches, and now - Seamus screams at Deirdre.

                          SEAMUS
               To the right!!!

     Deirdre swerves to the right only to discover that she's now
     on an -

     EXIT RAMP, going against heavy traffic.  Now -

     Deirdre swerves her car around, side-swiping several cars,
     but avoiding a major crash while - The Peugeot follows along,
     and now -

     One of the cars that Deirdre side-swiped careens wildly down
     the ramp, crashing into - The Peugeot, which grinds to a halt
     as Vincent and Sam bounce forward in their seats, restrained
     by their seatbelts.  The car has stalled, and Sam has to
     start her up again and slam it into gear before following
     after - The Compact, which now has a lead of perhaps fifty
     yards -- but at least it's possible for the Peugeot to follow
     after the Compact, because it's the only car on the highway
     ahead of them that's GOING THE WRONG WAY, and now we - PULL
     BACK, LOOKING DOWN FROM ABOVE, and the two cars are flying
     through the rush-hour traffic, going the wrong way, and now -
     The Peugeot is gaining ground as Sam turns to Vincent.

                          SAM
               Give me a cigarette.

                          VINCENT
               Right now?

                          SAM
               Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!

                          VINCENT
                   (fumbling with a cigarette)
               Why are you driving?
                   (rapid fire)
               You're not French, you don't live here,
               you don't know these roads.  Why are you
               driving?

     He puts the cigarette in Sam's mouth and as he does - The
     Peugeot weaves in and out of the traffic, gaining ground on
     the Compact, and now - SCREEEEECCHHH!!!!  About fifteen cars
     pile up, crashing into one another, and yet somehow - The
     Compact Car emerges from the pile up unscathed, and Seamus
     breathes a hugh sigh of relief.

                          SEAMUS
               About time!

                          DEIRDRE
                   (glancing in her mirror) 
               Not yet...

     The Peugeot has also managed to avoid the pile-up, and it's
     back on their tail.

                          SEAMUS
                   (practically tearing his hair)
               Good Christ!  Can't you lose these
               jokers?

                          DEIRDRE
                   (through clenched teeth)
               They're good!

     And now the Peugeot SLAMS into the side of the Compact Car,
     and as it does - Seamus opens fire with his gun, even as -
     Vincent unloads the better part of a clip as - Glass shatters
     in both cars, and now Deirdre looks up to see -

     A FORK IN THE ROAD, and the left side of the fork is closed
     off, blocked by - A SERIOUS CONCRETE BARRICADE, and the
     Compact Car is headed right for it, and now -

     Sam has the Peugeot pinned right to the side of the Compact
     Car, metal against metal, a scream of steel as the Barricade
     rushes straight at them and at the last second - Deirdre
     slams on the brakes as -

     Seamus fires one last shot that - blows out the window in
     front of Sam's eyes, causing Sam to - Jerk the wheel of the
     Peugeot wildly, spinning out of control onto the exit ramp as
     Gregor reaches over and unbuckles Seamus's seatbelt right as -
     The Compact Car slams into the Barricade and CRASHES, and
     we're in SLOW MOTION as -

     Deirdre is driven forward by the force of the impact, but
     there's a driver's side air bag, and it explodes, cushioning
     her, even as -

     Seamus is hurled form the car, crashing through the
     windshield and flying through the air as -

     The Compact Car flips over and over and over while -

     Gregor, who is wearing his seatbelt, hangs on for dear life
     to the Briefcase, which he grabbed back from Seamus before
     the crash, and now -

     Seamus hits the ground with a terrible thud, his face
     sliced to ribbons by the windshield, but somehow still alive
     as -

     Sam tries to control the Peugeot, which is in a spin on the
     exit ramp as -

     Gregor kicks open the back door and slides out of the Car,
     carrying the Briefcase with him, as -

     Deirdre struggles to free herself from the wreck, which is
     now - On fire, and now -

     Sam has managed to stop the Peugeot, but it's too late to go
     back, because -

     A VERITABLE FLEET OF COP CARS is now closing on the accident,
     and it's too late to turn around, and even as -

     Deirdre manages to pull herself out of the wreck, it -
     EXPLODES into a ball of fire, and the blast wave of fire -
     Hits Seamus, knocking him down, covering him for a second,
     even as - Deirdre hurls herself through the flames and comes
     out - Rolling away with Seamus, who is now not only cut to
     pieces, but his face is covered with some hideous burns.

     Now Deirdre pulls Seamus over the side of the embankment,
     right before the cops arrive, and the two of them roll/fall
     almost thirty down a steep incline, even as -

     Sam catches a quick glimpse of -

     Gregor, scurrying away from the highway, carrying the
     Briefcase, and now Sam has to gun his car and get gone,
     because the Cops have reached -

     The Wreck, which is quickly burning itself out, and as the
     Cops look into the debris they see that -

     THERE'S NOBODY LEFT.  Everybody's gone.

     FADE OUT.

                          VINCENT (V.O.)
               We don't have much time.

     FADE IN ON:

     INT. VINCENT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     A FRONT DOOR, guarded by about five heavy locks, opens and
     Vincent and Sam enter.  Sam looks around and surveys the
     apartment.

                          SAM
               Nice place.

     ANOTHER ANGLE - And we see the rest of the apartment: there's
     practically nothing here.  A table with a couple of chairs, a
     fridge.  An open door leads to a bedroom with a small, spare
     bed and a nightstand with a cheap lamp.

                          VINCENT
                   (by way of explaining)
               I'm not here very much.

                          SAM
               Business keeps you on the road?

                          VINCENT
               Something like that.

     The two men crass the room towards - A METAL CABINET which is
     tucked into a nook in the wall - VINCENT'S HAND turns a heavy-
     duty COMBINATION LOCK and then: Click, the cabinet opens and
     we see -- WEAPONS.  An endless cache of guns, knives,
     explosives, surveillance devices, gun scopes -- you name it,
     it's here.  Now Vincent's Hands reach into the cabinet and
     start taking out weapons.  We PULL BACK ON -

     Vincent, who gives the weapons to Sam.  Sam checks to make
     sure the weapons are loaded and/or ready for use, and then
     piles them, one on top of the other.

                          SAM
               I know I don't need to say this to you,
               but I need to say it to you.
                   (beat)
               This is my job, I have to do it.

                          VINCENT
               So I do it.

                          SAM
               No you don't, and you know it.

                          VINCENT
               If our positions were reversed, would you
               leave me?

                          SAM
                   (he says this too quickly)
               In a minute.

                          VINCENT
               I think not.

     BEAT.  Sam can't say anything, because he knows that what
     Vincent is saying is true.

                          VINCENT
                   (considering the weapons)
               Do we need anything else?

                          SAM
               Yeah.  We need out fucking heads examined.

     Vincent thinks about this for a seoncd -- and then burst out
     laughing as we -

     CUT TO:

     INT. ANOTHER CAR - MEANWHILE/NIGHT

     Deirdre once behind the wheel.  The passenger seat next to
     her is empty, but as she drives we can see her eyes as they
     flick from the road in front of her, to the rearview mirror,
     which reveals -

     A glimpse of the HIDEOUS FACE of Seamus Reilly.  Crashing
     through the windshield and the blast of fire have forever
     changed the way he looks: his face is now a mass of oozing
     wounds and burn tissue.  In his eyes we see the light of a
     sick, twisted man who's gone over the edge.

                          DEIRDRE
               You better be careful, Seamus, before
               something happens a plastic surgeon can't
               fix.

                          SEAMUS
                   (a hideous laugh)
               Plastic fucking surgeon?
                   (indicates his face)
               You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre
               lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and
               I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those
               who done it to me, I'll take my pound of
               flesh before this is all over.

                          DEIRDRE
               You're thinking with your gun, Seamus,
               and not your head...

                          SEAMUS
                   (losing it)
               Shut up!!!
                   (he puts a gun to her head)
               Shut up and drive!  I'm your superior
               officer and you will do as I goddamn well
               say, is that understood?!?

     BEAT.  Deirdre bristles at Seamus's words but says nothing.

                          SEAMUS
               Do I need to repeat myself?

                          DEIRDRE
               No, Seamus.  I heard you the first time.

     EXT. OUTSIDE THE CAR - SAME TIME

     THE CAR zooms off into the night and as it does -

     A LIGHT RAIN starts to fall and we -

     DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. A CHATEAU OUTSIDE OF PARIS - NIGHT

     THE SAME RAIN falls, more of a steady mist than a rain.  The
     mist GLEAMS electrically in the THOUSAND WATT LIGHTS which
     shine from - THE CHATEAU.  Hundreds of years old, it sits far
     back from its own MAIN GATE.  In front of the Chateau - ARMED
     MEN.  Lots of them.  Whatever this place is, it's not one
     that invites company.  Now we're - MOVING TOWARDS the
     Chateau, and as we MOVE we get a glimpse of the surrounding
     environment: ancient statues, sitting benches in private
     gardens, small pools of fish -- you name it, this place has
     it.  We hear VOICES, and they're talking in - RUSSIAN.
     Heavy, thick Russian, punctuated with words like "Da!" and
     "Nyet!" -- making it clear that we've reached the address of
     the Russian Production Company.  BEHIND THE CHATEAU - MORE
     GARDENS, more everything.  It's well-patrolled, but there
     aren't quite as many guards back here as there are out front,
     because bordering the chateau is a natural fotress -

     A WOODS -

     A forest, really.  Filled with ancient trees, almost mythic
     in appearance, and for all the light of the chateau this
     place is darkness visible -- light comes here and dies.  And
     in this woods, looking out, we find - Vincent and Sam.
     Heavily armed, they've just humped God knows how many miles
     through the woods to get here.  Both men exhausted from the
     walk -- Sam from his wound, Vincent from his smoking habit.
     They collapse and Vincent takes out his cigarettes.  Even
     though they're screened from the chateau back here, Sam
     reaches over and takes the cigarettes out of Vincent's hands.

                          SAM
               Not here.  They might see it.

                          VINCENT
               If I'm going to die for the CIA, I'm
               going to go out smoking.
                   (takes the cigarettes back and
                    lights one)
               Besides, there's half a forest between us
               and them, they can't see a goddamned
               thing.

     Vincent offers one to Sam, who declines with a shake of
     his head.

                          SAM
               Time to quit.

                          VINCENT
               Just like that?

                          SAM
               Not just like that... Just before I turn
               around and it's six months from now and
               the first thing I do when I wake up in
               the morning is light a cigarette.

                          VINCENT
                   (obviously he does this)
               What of it?
                   (almost to himself)
               Samurai pain in the ass.

                          SAM
                   (he hates this)
               Would you stop with that...

                          VINCENT
               Why?  You've got more force of will than
               anyone I've ever seen.  You handle a gun
               like it's a part of you, you perform
               surgery on yourself without anesthesia...
                   (quick beat)
               And most amazing of all, you quit
               smoking, just like that.

                          SAM
                   (qith a cynical laugh)
               The mark of a true Samurai.
                   (seriously)
               What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no
               different than what you do.  We're both
               hired guns, and this is a job -- like any
               other job.

                          VINCENT
               Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is
               a job like any other?  Surely, if you are
               a hired gun, you realize that some times
               you just have to walk away without
               getting what you came for.

                          SAM
               Because I don't walk away.

                          VINCENT
               Why not?

                          SAM
               It's the one thing I've got left to hold
               onto.
                   (beat)
               Jean-Pierre is one of your closest
               friends, is he not?

                          VINCENT
               Closest and oldest.

                          SAM
               And yet you would have killed him to save
               my life.
                   (quick beat)
               You have a sense of honor, Vincent, that
               I can't even remember anymore.  I don't
               know that I ever even had it to begin
               with.  All I know to do, Vincent, is to
               finish my job.

                          VINCENT
               And when you finish?  What then?  This
               package, whatever it is, do you give it
               to the CIA?  Do you really think they
               deserve it?

                          SAM
               That's a good question.

                          VINCENT
               Do you have a good answer?

                          SAM
                   (he's really just considering
                    this)
               No, I don't.

     INT. THE CHATEAU - MEANWHILE

     ARMED RUSSIAN MOBSTERS everywhere -- a convention of the goon
     squad.

     MOVING THROUGH the Chateau itself, and from in here we see
     the side of France we haven't yet seen in this film: culture.
     Each room could be a museum, as we move through -

     A GALLERY, filled with paintings by Renaissance Masters -

     A PARLOR, with antique furniture, the youngest piece of which
     is two hundred years old -

     A BALLROOM, empty and barren, but lit by the dazzling light
     of an exquisite chandelier -

     A KITCHEN, where a cigarette smoking CHEF is putting the
     finishing touches on what is perhaps the most amazing meal
     you've ever seen.  Now - A SERVANT takes the tray and carries
     it out to -

     A DINING ROOM, and the table is set for a formal dinner for
     twenty, with crystal and china at every place setting, and
     yet the table is occupied by only one man -

     MIKHAEL RACHEV, Russian Gangster Supreme, called Mikhi.  Now -

     The Servant sets the food down in front of Mikhi, and as this
     chief hood starts to eat a lonely and solitary dinner we PULL
     BACK, MOVING DOWN the length of the way-too-long table.

     EXT. THE CHATEAU WALLS - NIGHT

     A TAXI pulls up to the Main Gate and Gregor gets out.
     Attached to his wrist, by that same handcuff: the Briefcase.
     Gregor is admitted by a Guard as we -

     CUT TO:

     INT. THE DINING ROOM/CHATEAU - A LITTLE LATER

     Mikhi the Gangster is eating his dinner as Gregor is ushered
     into the room.  THREE THUGS hang back behind Gregor, watching
     to see what Mikhi wants.  Now -

     Mikhi waves the Thugs out of the room, leaving Gregor alone
     with the gangster.  Mikhi takes a last few bites of dinner as
     he motions for Gregor to sit.

                          MIKHI
                   (in Russian, English subtitles)
               Sit, sit...
                   (offering a cigarette)
               Would you like one?

                          GREGOR
                   (in English)
               No, Mikhi, I wouldn't.
                   (letting that sink in for a
                    minute)
               Since I won't speak your language, and
               you can't speak mine, English will do
               nicely.

                          MIKHI
                   (makes no never mind to him)
               Whatever you wish...
                   (lights his own cigarette)
               This has all been a terrible mistake,
               Gregor.  I wanted to play straight with
               you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill
               you.

                          GREGOR
               Edvard said the same thing about you
               before he died.

                          MIKHI
               I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd
               believe him.

                          GREGOR
                   (suddenly sharp)
               Enough!

     Gregor raises the Briefcase which is still attached to his
     wrist via the handcuff.  Gregor rests the Briefcase on the
     table.

                          MIKHI
               Ahh...

     The moment of truth.  Before this scene can develop any
     further, a VOICE comes from Off Screen, and as the Voice
     speaks, Gregor blanches.

                          SEAMUS (O.S.)
               The moment of truth, is it?

     ANOTHER ANGLE - Deirdre and Seamus have entered the room.
     And we notice something unusual: nobody is alarmed (except
     for Gregor, that is).  It's as if they were expected.

                          GREGOR
               What is he doing here?

     As Seamus speaks he walks through the room, examining the
     valuable china and crystal, all the while moving inexorably
     closer to Gregor.  His face is, if anything, even more
     horrific than it was a short while ago, as his formerly fresh
     wounds have started to scab over.

                          SEAMUS
               What am I doing here?  Why, I'm here to
               see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the
               Russian Mafia.  See, your bosses had
               hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull
               your thieving double cross.  But they
               only just found out that what's in the
               briefcase is completely useless without
               me.  I can't fight them, and they can't
               kill me -- that means we're gonna have to
               do business together.

                          GREGOR
               But you hate each other!

                          SEAMUS
               What's a little hate between business
               partners?

     EXT. THE WOODS - MEANWHILE

     Vincent's CIGARETTE is stubbed into a rock and the two men
     rise with a slow purpose.  They exchange a look and then Sam
     steps forward, leading the way

                          SAM
               I'm on point, Vincent.

     A WIDE ANGLE - THE BACK LAWN OF THE CHATEAU -

     Pure Kurosawa.  The JAPANESE DRUM we've heard before starts
     to play again as -

     THE LONG SHADOWS of Sam and Vincent come out of the woods and
     into the brilliant light of the back lawn.  For one minute
     they stand still, and among the many weapons that Sam carries
     is a long automatic rifle, strung over his back, and in the
     SILHOUETTE for one minute it looks like a Samurai sword.  Now
     the two men start to move across the lawn, hugging the
     shadows of the various statues and hedges, trying to keep
     from being discovered for as long as possible.

     BACK IN THE DINING ROOM -

                          GREGOR
                   (to Seamus)
               So, you've got it all figured, do you?

                          SEAMUS
               Figured enough to know there's an odd man
               out and I'm looking at him.

                          GREGOR
               I think not.
                   (holds up the Briefcase)
               I have, of course, taken the precaution
               of wiring the briefcase to explode five
               seconds after it opens.  Unless, of
               course, I deactivate it before it goes
               off.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (under her breath)
               That fucking figures...

                          GREGOR
               Should any of you decide to rush me, I'll
               kill myself and whoever happens to be
               near me at the time.

                          MIKHI
               And more importantly --

                          GREGOR
               I'll destroy whatever's in the case.

     BEAT.  Nobody moves.  Nobody speaks.  Until finally -

                          SEAMUS
               It looks, Gentlemen, as if we're gonna
               have to sit down to table and work out an
               agreement.

     Before this entirely too-weird scenario can play itself we go
     back to -

     THE BACK LAWN OF THE CHATEAU -

     Sam and Vincent are closer to the Chateau, moving in stealth,
     avoiding any entanglements and then Sam turns a corner and
     comes face to face with - A GUARD, and his gun is aimed at
     Sam's head: Sam's a dead man as we go -

     BACK TO THE DINING ROOM

     AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRE splits the night, and everyone in the
     room looks at one another, before Mikhi speaks.

                          MIKHI
               What was that?

     BACK OUTSIDE THE CHATEAU -

     The Guard who had Sam in his sights falls down, dead, shot by
     - Vincent, whose smoking weapon is cradled in his arms.
     Vincent smiles at Sam.

                          VINCENT
               That's one less I owe you...

     Sam smiles, but it's no time to get satisfied.  their
     presence revealed, there's no point in moving quietly.  Sam
     draws his weapons and as he and Vincent charge across the
     lawn towards the Chateau while -

     BACK IN THE DINING ROOM -

     MORE GUNSHOTS from outside -- not a war, but enough to cause
     serious alarm.  Deirdre, ever the soldier, draws her two
     automatic pistols.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (to Seamus and Mikhi)
               You two stay here and watch our mutual
               interest.

     She nods at Gregor and his Briefcase, indicating what this
     mutual interest is.  Then she turns and bolts the room, and
     as she does we're -

     BACK OUTSIDE THE CHATEAU -

     Sam and Vincent are running along, hugging the ground and
     whatever darkness they can find, while blind weapons fire
     rips into the ground around them, Russian thugs not even sure
     what they're shooting at, but shooting all the same as Sam
     and Vincent hurtle towards -

     A BACK ENTRANCE TO THE CHATEAU -

     Some kind of kitchen storage area, and as Sam and Vincent
     burst in from outside - FIVE RUSSIAN HOODS come flying in
     from an interior entrance, and this is it, Sam and Vincent
     are outnumbered, outgunned, they're going to die and then -
     They take out the entire room - Sam holds an automatic pistol
     in his left hand, and a submachine gun in his right, and when
     he fires, he does so in short controlled bursts, firing only
     when he has the target in his sights, while - Vincent fights
     with a kind of sheer force, a shotgun in one hand, an Uzi in
     the other, he fires at anything and everything that moves,
     and he hits almost all of it - And suddenly the room is
     quiet.  Everybody's dead except for Sam and Vincent.  They
     drop their spent weapons and take out fresh ones even as they
     move towards - THE DOOR - It leads to two passages, each one
     leading to a separate wing of the chateau.

                          SAM
               Let's work our way through the building.
               I'll take one wing, you take the other.

     Vincent and Sam split up, moving into separate WINGS of the
     Chateau, and as they move off Sam speaks a word of warning.

                          SAM
               Watch your back, Vincent.

     And then they're gone, and we're with -

     Deirdre, who's running through the house, going from room to
     room, and we're with her for a minute, the JAPANESE DRUM
     starts to play again, and now it's joined by more and more
     drums, and they continue for the test of this sequence and
     suddenly - A HUGE BURST OF GUNFIRE is heard, dragging
     Deirdre's attention towards -

     THE BALLROOM -

     And Sam's in the middle of a pitched battle with three
     Gunmen.  He kills the first, and then the second, and then -
     No third.  The Third Gunman rolls out of the way as Sam
     fires, the Third Gunman fires back and - Their shots go wide,
     ripping into mirrors and chandeliers, littering the floor
     with glass.  And now we're -

     ON DEIRDRE -

     Running through the halls as we hear one last burst of
     gunfire: somebody in the ballroom is dead.  Deirdre has
     almost reached the ballroom when - Sam comes flying out, and
     the two of them CRASH TOGETHER, sending the two of them
     sprawling into - The shot-up mess that used to be the
     Ballroom - And as they crash to the ground, Sam loses his
     weapon in the fall, but Deirdre manages to hold onto one of
     her two guns.  Now the two of them roll to their feet, and as
     they do we're back in -

     THE DINING ROOM -

     Seamus the Madman is pacing the floor, his face even worse
     than before: with each minute the mask of flesh that is now
     his face is becoming more grotesque.  Little pustules have
     started to form all over its surface, oozing a whitish
     viscous liquid.  A NEW BURST OF FIGHTING SOUNDS can be heard,
     and Seamus, who is no longer capable of thinking straight,
     loses it.

                          SEAMUS
               I can't take it anymore.
                   (to Mikhi)
               Watch him, man, I'm going out and finish
               what needs finishing!

     And Seamus is gone, and so are we -- back to -

     THE BALLROOM -

     Where Deirdre has her two guns pointed at Sam and - Does nothing.
     BEAT.

                          SAM
               Go on, them...

     But Deirdre can't do it.  There's something between these
     two, and now - Sam looks around and sees Deirdre's other
     pistol lying on a broken chair, and now he -

     Kicks out with his foot and hits the chair leg, causing it to
     function as a lever, sending the gun - THROUGH THE AIR in a
     graceful SLOW-MO arc until it - THWACKS into Sam's Hand.  Now
     he's armed and he looks back at - Deirdre.  Her FINGER
     tightens on the trigger, she's almost ready to shoot -- if
     Sam raises his piece, he's a dead man.

                          DEIRDRE
               Let it go, Sam, walk away.

     In response Sam stares at Deirdre for a BEAT and then he
     smiles an enigmatic smile and - He steps sideways, into a
     nearby corridor, vanishing.

                          DEIRDRE
               God damn it!

     She runs after him but she's too late -- The corridor outside
     is empty.  Now we're back in -

     THE DINING ROOM -

     With Gregor and Mikhi, and the tension is unbearable, because
     they can hear the sounds of the fighting as it starts and
     then stops, but they don't have the least idea of what's
     going on.  Still, Mikhi won't let Gregor leave without giving
     up the Briefcase.  Mikhi has a gun on Gregor, who in turn
     holds the Briefcase close, ready to open it and set off the 5
     Second Timer that will blow it up.

                          GREGOR
                   (a feral hiss)
               We'll die if we stay here!

                          MIKHI
                   (threatening with the gun)
               You'll die if you leave here.

     Gregor sits back down, fairly close to Mikhi.  Then, in a
     manner so deft that Mikhi never even notices, Gregor extracts
     a wickedly thin stiletto blade from the leather lining of the
     Briefcase.  Before Mikhi can even react, Gregor stabs his arm
     forward in a savage arc - JAMMING THE BLADE into Mikhi's
     throat.  Mikhi drops his gun and reaches for the blade,
     already gagging on the blood spray which shoots from the
     slashed artery.  Within seconds - Mikhi falls to the ground,
     jerking viciously in his death throes as - Gregor picks up
     the pistol and runs to leave the room, and as he does we move
     to - 

     THE GALLERY -

     Filled with Paintings and Sculptures, nothing less than 200
     years old.  This place is a maze, what with it's walls of
     paintings that jut out here and there, the various corridors
     which lead from room to room, and the sculptures which block
     sight lines.  Now we find - Vincent, pressed against a wall, a
     gun in each hand, while - FIVE RUSSIAN MAFIA GUYS are hunting
     him down.  We do a SERIES OF QUICK CUTS as the Five Guys split
     up and look for Vincent, all the while speaking in low Russian
     voices.  Suddenly one of the Guys turns a corner and sees -
     Nothing.  No Vincent.  Now he turns back and - A FIST CRASHES
     through a painting which hangs on a makeshift wall.  It's
     Vincent.  His hand wraps around Mafia Guy's neck, pinning him
     in place.  Seconds later - Two quick shots rip through the
     painting, hitting Mafia Guy in the head.  Now - The other men
     are alerted by the shots, they come running and - Vincent steps
     out firing -

     And now it's a bullet-fest, as he gets the drop on them,
     using the maze of the Gallery to his fullest advantage,
     gunning them down - First one - Then two - Three, and then -
     No four.  Vincent turns, surprised that his man wasn't where
     he expected him to be when - A SHOT RINGS OUT, hitting
     Vincent, a flesh wound that disarms him.  The Last Guy has
     the drop on Vincent.  Now - The Last Guy smiles a nasty
     little smile at Vincent and - A PISTOL spits fire and - A
     BULLET bursts out of the Last Guy's chest.  It's Sam.  Now
     Sam and Vincent exchange a look: Sam has, once again, saved
     Vincent's life.

                          VINCENT
               You have to stop doing that!

                          SAM
               I'll work on it...

     The two men don't have time for any more words, they move
     from the Gallery and find themselves in -

     THE DINING ROOM -

     Where they find nothing but the bloody remains of Mikhi the
     Gangster.  Sam and Vincent are surveying the room when a
     VOICE comes from BEHIND them -

                          SEAMUS (O.S.)
               Turn around real slow, and try hard not
               to breathe when you do it.

     ANOTHER ANGLE - Seamus Reilly has come in behind them, and
     he's got his gun pointed straight at Sam's heart.  If Seamus
     is enraged at discovering Gregor's absence, he's overjoyed to
     find Sam in his place.

                          SEAMUS
               It's you...
                   (touches his face)
               You're the one did this to my face, are
               you?

                          SAM
               That's me.

                          SEAMUS
               Have a nice afterlife.

     Seamus pulls the trigger and his BULLET spins out towards
     Sam, ready to blow a hole through him except that - Vincent
     leaps forward and takes the bullet -- it rips into his side,
     a huge splash of red against his white shirt.  He falls to
     the ground, horribly wounded, but he's given Sam enough time,
     and now - Sam and Seamus open fire on one another - BULLETS
     RIPPING into the table, chewing up the china and crystal,
     taking glass shattering bites out of the CHANDELIER above the
     table, turning the Dining Room from a primo Louis XIV
     showpiece into shit as the two men move about and then
     suddenly - They're face to face, each with a gun to the other
     - Mexican Standoff.  Suddenly, from Off Screen -

                          DEIRDRE (O.S.)
               Seamus!

     ANOTHER ANGLE - Deirdre has appeared, her gun leveled at the
     two men.

                          SEAMUS
               Deirdre, do for him, woman, put a fucking
               bullet in his head!

     Deirdre hesitates, uncertain.

                          SEAMUS
               Do it, for Christ's sake, do it so we can
               find that stinking Gregor, he's got the
               bloody package!  For God's sake, you're a
               soldier...

     These last words sink into Deirdre: she is a soldier.  Her
     gun swivels towards Sam.

                          SEAMUS
                   (sensing he's getting to
                    her)
               You're one of us...You been born and bred
               with your own people, you can't go
               against your nature.  C'mon, girl, I'm
               you're people.

     Deirdre makes up her mind.

                          DEIRDRE
               I'm no girl, Seamus...

     She fires a shot - Blowing Seamus off his feet and through a
     huge PLATE GLASS WINDOW.

                          DEIRDRE
               And you ain't nobody's people.

     She moves with Sam to Vincent, who is seriously wounded --
     perhaps life-threateningly so.

                          SAM
                   (to Deirdre)
               Let's get him out of here...

                          VINCENT
               Finish the job...

                          SAM
               And now...

                          VINCENT
                   (a commanding whisper)
               Finish it!

     Sam considers, but before he can make up his mind, Deirdre
     sees something through the wreck of the Dining Room Window -

     OUT ON THE BACK LAWN - We've already seen that it's bordered
     on one side by the woods, for the first time we notice - A
     LAKE, which laps against a PRIVATE DOCK, where a row boat is
     tethered.  Now - BENEATH A VERY FULL MOON, the stark figure
     of Gregor makes its way toward the Dock.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (calling out)
               Sam...

     Sam turns at the sound of her voice and sees Gregor making
     his escape.  Sam looks back at Vincent, who is almost passed
     out from blood loss.

                          VINCENT
               I'm really sick of you saving my life.  Go
               out and get the bastard.

     Same makes up his mind, and as Vincent passes out, Sam runs
     out after Deirdre and towards -

     THE PRIVATE DOCK -

     And as the two of them run we MOVE WITH THEM.

                          DEIRDRE
               He's got the briefcase rigged to explode
               five seconds after anybody other than
               himself tries to open it.

     And now they reach the Dock and they find - Nothing -- no
     Gregor.  And the Boat is still there.  Before Sam can
     restrain her - Deirdre stps out towards the Boat.

                          SAM
               Deirdre, wait up --

     But it's too late: Gregor steps out from behind -

     A BOATHOUSE, and before Deirdre can even figure out what
     happened, Gregor has her in an arm lock, a gun to her head.
     His free hand sticks out and we see the Briefcase, which is
     still handcuffed to his wrist.

                          GREGOR
               You might have made a good field agent
               you arrogant American prick, but you're
               not smart enough to go up against me.

     Gregor and Deirdre are poised at the edge of the lake.  This
     Private Dock is made completely of stone, and the drop to the
     water is nearly five feet.  Sam has reached a position where
     there is no right answer.  Still, he points his gun at
     Gregor, who in turn shields himself with Deirdre's body.

                          GREGOR
               Go ahead, shoot... Shoot and kill the
               bitch, I don't care.
                   (beat)
               And yet you don't shoot.  Interesting.
               Put down your weapon and walk away.

                          DEIRDRE
               Don't do it, Sam!

                          GREGOR
               Shut up!

                          DEIRDRE
               He'll kill me anway, Sam, shoot though
               me and kill this fucker.

                          SEAMUS (O.S.)
                   (a horrible croak)
               If you don't, I will...

     ANOTHER ANGLE - Seamus is somehow still barely alive -- he's
     not long for this world, but the will for revenge has driven
     him this far.

                          SEAMUS
                   (to Sam, in a cold pale rage)
               Shoot that traitorous bitch and I'll let
               you live.

     THE TOP OF SEAMUS'S HEAD explodes, finishing him off once and
     for all, killed by -

     Vincent, who has staggered out to make this one necessary
     shot.  But he can go no further, and he collapses in his own
     blood, near death, just as - Gregor takes a step towards the
     boat and - Sam makes up his mind and shoots - THE BULLET
     FLIES ACROSS THE SCREEN -

     IMPACT - The Briefcase bursts, shot open by Sam and now we're
     in SLOW MOTION as -

     Gregor relaxes his grip on Deirdre as he struggles to close
     the case and - Deirdre takes the opportunity to dive the
     other, into the lake, while -

     BABOOM!  The case EXPLODES, a flash of phosphorescent white
     light that incinerates Gregor and the case and whatever was
     inside it with an explosion that knocks Sam to the ground and
     when the light clears - Gregor and the case are gone, while -
     THE EXPLOSION ECHOES out over the lake, booming again and
     again until finally there is - SILENCE.  Sam looks out over
     the lake for any sign of Deirdre - But there is none.  And
     then, after we've held for a BEAT longer than it should be
     possible for her to have survived - her head splits the
     surface and she emerges, coughing.  Sam reaches down to help
     her out.

                          SAM
               Are you alright?

                          DEIRDRE
               Alright?  It's bloody fucking freezing in
               here!

     Sam pulls Deirdre out of the water and then the two of them
     immediately turn and move towards Vincent, and as they do we
     start to PULL BACK on them, and now the SOUNDS of SIRENS can
     be heard, one, then two more, and then a symphony of noise.
     And we're STILL PULLING BACK ON -

     THE CHATEAU - Or what's left of it, because it's started to
     burn, and quickly the flames start to rise into the night,
     like something out of medieval times as we -

     DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. A HOSPITAL WAITING AREA - NIGHT

     Sam waits outside a hospital room, inside of which we get a
     glimpse of - A DOCTOR tending to a heavily bandaged and
     sedated Vincent.  As Sam waits - TWO GENDARMES and a
     PLAINCLOTHES DETECTIVE approach.  The Detective looks at Sam
     for a BEAT, and then goes to push past him.  Sam blocks his
     way.

                          DETECTIVE
               I need to speak with that man.

                          SAM
               I'm sorry, I can't allow that.

     Sam reaches into his coat, and for a moment everybody thinks
     he's going for his gun, but instead he comes out with - A
     PIECE OF PAPER.  He hands it to the Detective.

                          SAM
               Call that number and ask them what you
               should do.

     The Detective eyeballs the number suspiciously.

     FIVE MINUTES LATER -

     The Detective hangs up a nearby wall phone and then looks
     over at Sam in disgust.  Without another word, the Detective
     signals to the two Gendarmes, and all three men exit.  Now -

     The DOCTOR, a beautiful French Woman, comes up and speaks to
     him in FRENCH -- and the amazing thing is that Sam speaks
     back.  Everything in SUBTITLED.

                          DOCTOR
               You can see your friend, now.

                          SAM
               Thank you very much.

                          DOCTOR
               The field dressing you put on saved his
               life.
                   (giving him a look)
               Where di you learn to do that?

                          SAM
               Here and there, I guess.

     The Doctor isn't entirely satisfied with this answer, but
     it's the only one she's going to get, because Sam moves past
     into -

     INT. VINCENT'S ROOM

     He's barely alive -- but alive nonetheless.  And he's heard
     Sam speak in French to the Doctor.

                          VINCENT
               You son-of-a-bitch...

                          SAM
               What?

                          VINCENT
               You speak French.

                          SAM
               What of it?

                          VINCENT
                   (in mock exasperation)
               Nothing...

     He lies back on his pillow, pissed and yet amused.

                          VINCENT
                   (repeating the Doctor's words
                    in English)
               "Your field dressing saved his life."
               That's three I owe you.

                          SAM
               You don't owe me a goddamned thing,
               Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in
               front of a bullet for me.
                   (very seriously, he now
                    believes this)
               I owe you a heavy debt.

                          VINCENT
                   (relishing this)
               I know.

                          SAM
                   (rising to leave)
               You better get some sleep, alright?

                          VINCENT
               Tell me something first.
                   (a quick beat)
               The package: what was it?

                          SAM
               I don't know.  Nobody knows, except a
               bunch of people who are too dead to tell
               us.  There's probably a couple of guys
               back at the Company who know, but I don't
               think they plan to tell me anytime soon.

                          VINCENT
               What happened to it?
     
                          SAM
               Gone.  Destroyed.

                          VINCENT
                   (sighs, then a beat)
               I guess that's for the best.

     Sam turns for the door but Vincent has one last thing to say.

                          VINCENT
               Sam, when Gregor had Deirdre by the lake,
               you could have killed the two of them
               with one shot.  You could have had the
               package, finished the job.  But you
               didn't, you sacrificed the job to save
               her life.  Why?

     Same has to think about this for a second, and his answer
     reveals just how full circle he's come.

                          SAM
               It's what you would have done.

     And on that note Sam exits the room, leaving a bemused
     Vincent behind.

     EXT. THE BANK OF THE RIVER SEINE - EARLY MORNING

     A WISPY FOG atmospherically rises off the river -- not too
     thick, not too thin.

     A TITLE: One month later...

     We're MOVING along the cobble-stone walk next to the river as
     a VOICE cuts through the fog.

                          VINCENT (V.O.)
               Would you just smoke already...

     A RIVERSIDE CAFE - Where Sam, Vincent and Deirdre are having
     morning coffee.  A mostly-healed Vincent is smoking a
     cigarette, trying to get Sam to light up.

                          SAM
               I told you, I quit.

                          VINCENT
               Just to keep me company, Sam -- I hate
               smoking alone.
                   (turning to Deirdre)
               How about you?  I thought all you IRA
               types smoked.

                          DEIRDRE
               Only the stupid ones.  Cigarettes kill
               more patriots than bullets.
                   (a quick beat)
               Besides, I'm not IRA no more.

                          VINCENT
               So where do you go from here?

                          DEIRDRE
               I don't know.  I was thinking...Maybe the
               three of us might partner up -- guns for
               hire, that sort of thing.

                          VINCENT
               I'm up for that...

     The two of them turn to Sam, but he shakes his head.

                          SAM
               Not me.  You work too often with the same
               people and you become friends -- clouds
               your judgement.

                          DEIRDRE
               Come off it, Sam -- if we weren't friends
               already we wouldn't be here now, would
               we?

                          VINCENT
               She's got a point.
                   (playing a trump card)
               Besides, I know of a job that's
               available.

     Sam can't help it -- he's interested.

                          SAM
               How much does it pay?

     SLAM CUT TO:

     EXT. OUT ON THE RIVER SEINE - MEANWHILE

     SILENCE AND FOG.  A RIVER FERRY does a slow ghostly glide
     down the river, and in seconds it approaches -

     THE RIVERSIDE CAFE, which appears through the mist, looked at
     by --

     A SLEEK PAIR OF SUN GLASSES attached to a young PUNK in a
     leather coat, and the Punk is looking at - Sam, Vincent, and
     especially: Deirdre.  Sam looks up and shouts a warning as -
     The Punk pulls a shotgun from beneath his leather coat, pumps
     the gun and screams out at Deirdre with an Irish accent -

                          PUNK
               This is for Seamus!

     BOOM!  The Punk pulls the trigger, a blast of fire as - Sam's
     gun is already out, TWO QUICK SHOTS squeezed off and - The
     Punk is capped twice in the head, dead, sailing away on the
     Ferry which never stops as -

     THE CAFE goes wild, CUSTOMERS running, screaming, WAITERS
     dropping their trays.  But - Sam doesn't run, and neither
     does Vincent.  Sam stands, stunned by what he sees - Deirdre
     lies on the ground, hit full on in the chest: she's dead.  A
     BEAT OF PURE SILENCE - Broken by SIRENS in the distance, but
     quickly growing closer.  Now - Vincent looks at Deirdre's
     corpse, then at Sam, who is unable to move.  For maybe the
     first time in his professional career, Sam is staggered by
     the loss of a life.  Vincent gently takes Sam's arm.

                          VINCENT
                   (soft yet urgent)
               We have to go, Sam, we can't be here.

     Sam looks at Vincent, and for a moment Sam struggles to find
     something to say, but he can't find a goddamned thing.  The
     SIRENS are getting louder -

                          VINCENT
                   (a little louder, bordering
                    desperation)
               Let's go!!

     Vincent literally drags Sam away and now the SIRENS have
     arrived, followed quickly by - THE GENDARMES, who come
     running into the Cafe but - It's empty except for Deirdre's
     body.  Now -

     THE STREET ABOVE THE RIVER -

     Sam and Vincent are running through patchy fog, Vincent
     leading the way, and now -

     We're CLOSER ON Vincent as he runs and runs and runs until he
     feels he's far enough away from the scene of the crime to
     relax.  He collapses against a stone wall, chest heaving,
     shaking out two cigarettes, one for himself and one for Sam.

                          VINCENT
                   (thrusting the cigarettes out to
                    Sam)
               Doctor's orders...

     But Sam isn't there to take the cigarette -- Vincent looks
     around, trying to see what happened to his friend, but the
     fog has covered any sign of Sam.  Vincent stands there,
     stunned, alone, the cigarettes in an outstretched hand that
     slowly falls back to Vincent's side as he realizes that Sam
     has left him on purpose.  Then - Vincent lights both
     cigarettes at the saem time and throws one of them over the
     stone wall - THE GLOWING CIGARETTE arcs through the air until
     it lands in the river where it extinguishes with a hiss.

                          VINCENT (O.S.)
               Goodbye, Sam...

     BACK AT THE CAFE -

     The Gendarmes have secured the scene (there isn't much to
     secure since everyone has run away).  A majority of cops
     surround Deirdre's dead body, but - One GENDARME wanders
     around the cafe, looking about, and then he sees something -

     ON THE STREET ABOVE -

     A SHAPE IN THE FOG.  The wind blows and the fog clears for a
     second, and we see that it's - Sam.  Getting one last look at
     Deirdre.  Quickly - The Gendarme points Sam out but as he
     does the wind continues to blow and - THE FOG swallows Sam.
     Seconds later the fog clears again, and when it does - Sam is
     gone.

     FADE OUT.
RONIN 

                      an original screenplay by

                              J.D. Zeik






                                             DRAFT: May 20, 1997







     A BLOOD RED SCREEN - A JAPANESE DRUM starts to play, softly,
     but tinged with a desperate edge, growing louder, joined by
     other DRUMS as a BLACK LEGEND scrolls up: In feudal Japan,
     the warrior class of Samurai were sworn to protect their
     liege lords with their lives.  Those Samurai whose liege was
     killed suffered a great shame, and they were forced to wander
     the land, looking for work as hired swords or bandits.  These
     masterless warriors were no longer referred to as Samurai,
     they were known by another name: Such men were called Ronin.
     The words hang on the screen and we hold for a BEAT, and then
     the DRUMS are cut off by - A SILENCED GUN SHOT: Thwpfft...

     FADE IN ON:

     INT. A MEDIEVAL CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

     It's dark, and so it takes us a minute to realize we're
     MOVING UP STONE SPIRALING STAIRS, up up up in what we now see
     is a medieval cathedral.  And as we continue MOVING UP
     something TRICKLES DOWN INTO FRAME - BLOOD.  Running thin,
     then thicker, as we CONTINUE TO MOVE UP the stairs and find -
     A BODY, sprawled awkwardly across the stones, arms and legs
     akimbo, not so much Christ-like as victim-like.  In one hand
     the Body holds a GUN he never had a chance to use.  In the
     other - A DARK SHAPE, we can't quite tell what it is.
     FOOTSTEPS sound from above and - THE KILLER walks into frame,
     silenced pistol dangling at his side.  We don't know him, and
     it's going to be a while before we see him again, but mark
     his face because we'll see him again.  The Killer now picks
     up the dark shape in the Body's hand, and we see it's - A
     BRIEFCASE.  The Killer cuffs the Briefcase to his wrist and
     turns to - TWO MEN standing behind him: subordinates.  The
     Killer shows them the Briefcase.

                          KILLER
               God loves me.

     THE BODY suddenly twitches -- this guy is not quite dead.
     The Killer raises his silenced pistol.

                          KILLER
                   (to his victim)
               But I don't think he's too fond of you...

     SLAM CUT TO:

     EXT. A BACK STREET - PARIS - NIGHT

     A PHONE RINGS, replacing the sound of the silenced gun shot
     we expected to hear.

     Rain-slicked cobblestones gleam in a twinkling of
     streetlight.

     EXT. A PHONE BOOTH AT THE END OF THE STREET

     The source of the ringing.  We start to PUSH SLOWLY IN one the
     phone booth, and as we do we hear the VOICE of an UGLY
     AMERICAN.

                          UGLY AMERICAN (V.O.)
               What is this?

     CUT TO:

     INT. A DRIVE BAR IN PARIS - NIGHT

     A SOCCER MATCH is in progress on a TV which sits above the
     bar in this smokey, dim dive.

                          UGLY AMERICAN (O.S.)
               This is not football...

     And now we're PULLING BACK DOWN THE LENGTH OF THE BAR.  We
     see THREE MEN sitting seperately at the bar, paying no
     attention to each other.  One of these men watches the game
     with real interest.  The Ugly American talks on from off
     screen.

                          UGLY AMERICAN (O.S.)
                   (continuing)
               ...Football is three hundred pound guys,
               they run way too fucking fast, they got
               helmets made of kevlar they use to spear
               the quarterback into the next life.

     SLAM CUT TO:

     EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE

     The phone is still ringing, louder now, and we're MOVING
     TOWARDS it while looking THROUGH AN UNSEEN PAIR OF EYES, and
     even as we drink this in we're back in -

     INT. THE BAR

     AT THE END OF THE BAR - LARRY, the Ugly American.  He's got
     an obvious attitude, all of it bad.  But there's something
     about the guy -- he's not all bluster, and he has the look of
     a seasoned tough guy who knows how to get rough and tumble.
     He's big, and yeah he's got a gut, but the rest of him looks
     solid.

                          LARRY
                   (talking to the air)
               You wanna know what football is?  It's
               hitting the other guy dirty and then
               spitting in his face when he's down.
               Football is all things American, and
               American is A-Number-One the absolute
               fucking best there is.  That's what
               football is...
                   (he points to the TV)
               ...And that's not football.

     The one man at the bar who's been watching the gam turns
     slowly and gives Larry a long look.  This is VINCENT: French,
     hard boiled and solid.  Charming when he wants to be, which
     isn't all that often.  He gives Larry a long look and then
     speaks -

                          VINCENT
                   (to Larry in perfect English)
               Football -- American football -- is a
               game for faggots.

     A BEAT.  The other two men at the bar, who seem like tough
     customers themselves, pretend not to watch too closely, but
     they're interested: what's Larry going to say?  For a moment
     it seems as if he's pissed, but then suddenly a smile breaks
     out on his face and he laughs heartily at Vincent's remark.
     Vincent joins in, as do the others.  In particular - THE
     BARTENDER looks relieved -- he's tough enough to toss a bar
     drunk, but these guys are in a different league.  The
     Bartender laughs with the others, happy to have avoided a
     confrontation as we go back to -

     EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE

     We're almost ON TOP OF the phone booth, the phone is still
     ringing as a HAND reaches INTO FRAME and snatches the phone
     from its cradle.

                          A WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                   (a touch Irish accent)
               Yes?

     ANOTHER ANGLE - And we see a woman named DEIRDRE on the
     phone: striking, dark-haired, Irish.  She carries herself
     with the same professional edge as the men inside the bar.
     Deirdre listens for a moment to the voice on the other end,
     and before she speaks she sense something - A SILHOUETTE
     stands in the shadows of the bar, watching Deirdre.  She
     gives this silhouette a measure glance before speaking, her
     hand creeping ever so slightly towards her coat.

                          DEIRDRE
               Can I help you?

     The silhouette steps into a POOL OF LIGHT.  This is SAM.
     Tough, lean, enigmatic.  Somebody you might trust, but whom
     you'd never cross.  Sam returns her look before he speaks.

                          SAM
               No...

     Sam moves towards the bar, and Deirdre returns to her phone
     conversation.

                          DEIRDRE
               I'm here...
                   (a beat, responding to a
                    question)
               No, it was nothing.

     INT. THE BAR - A MINUTE LATER

     Sam enters and by now the men inside have all come together
     at the bar, talking casually, recognizing they're somehow all
     here for a reason.  With Larry and Vincent we see - GREGOR, a
     man from Eastern Europe.  His accent is hard to pin down,
     but he most definitely has one.  Gregor has the air of an ex-
     spook, and that's exactly what he is.  Lastly we see SWEDE --
     blonde, muscular, and somehow blank in the face.  No, he's
     not stupid -- he's a sociopath.  Now - Sam looks at the
     group, which grows quiet as he enters.  Finally, Sam speaks.

                          SAM
               Sorry I'm late...

                          VINCENT
                   (a challenge)
               What makes you think we're here to meet
               you?

                          SAM
                   (meeting Vincent's gaze)
               Who else would you be?

     Vincent turns towards the others, including them in an
     expansive gesture.

                          VINCENT
               Perhaps the police?

                          SAM
               I know cops -- and you're no cop.

     Vincent smiles at Sam's answer, satisfied, and makes room for
     Sam to join them.  Vincent takes a pack of cigarettes, shakes
     them so that one sticks out, and offers it to Sam.

                          VINCENT
               Cigarette?

                          SAM
               No thanks.

     Vincent looks a little disappointed at this as we go -

     EXT. BACK OUTSIDE - SAME TIME

     THE PAY PHONE makes a sharp noise as it's cracked back into
     the cradle.  Deirdre stands at the phone booth, lost in
     thought.  Then, without warning - Deirdre spins around,
     pulling TWO GUNS from inside her coat.  The move is fast,
     performed with the grace of a professional killer, as Deridre
     scans the horizon, but nobody seems to be watching.  Deirdre
     pockets her guns and steps into the shadows of the street,
     the better to watch -

     THE BAR - And as Deirdre watches the bar we watch her.
     PULLING BACK from Deirdre, UP INTO THE AIR and then MOVING
     THROUGH TO -

     INT. A CHEAP APARTMENT - SAME TIME

     LOOKING THROUGH A WINDOW, donw onto the street below.  Barely
     visible we can see Deirdre.  And staring at Deirdre - THE
     WATCHER.  Somebody we're going to see periodically through
     the movie.  Right now he's only a SILHOUETTE with a well-
     defined PAIR OF HANDS.  And in those hands - A KNIFE.  As the
     Watcher watches he slowly cleans his nail with the knife,
     methodically, perfectly.  And he watches.  First Deirdre, and
     then turning his attention to THE BAR.  He's especially
     interested in the bar.

     A TIME CUT TO:

     INT. THE BAR - LATER

     The BARTENDER is wiping out a last glass.  When this is
     finished he looks up at -

     A TABLE IN THE BACK -

     Where our five guys have relocated.  Now the Bartender and
     Vincent exchange a look, and then the Bartender takes out a
     set of keys and tosses them - THROUGH THE AIR and they SMWACK
     into Vincent's hand.  The Bartender and Vincent speak in
     rapid-fire French, and then the Bartender is gone.  Sam turns
     to Vincent.

                          SAM
               He trusts you to lock up?

                          VINCENT
               Let's just say he knows who I am.

     Vincent takes out his pack of cigarettes and offer them
     around the table -- again, nobody takes on.  Vincent seems
     really disappointed by this.

                          LARRY
               Anybody wanna tell me what we're waiting
               for?

                          VINCENT
                   (lighting his cigarette)
               The question isn't what we're waiting
               for... it's who.

                          LARRY
               And who the fuck is that?

                          GREGOR
               Whoever hired us.

                          SAM
               I got this gig through a contractor.
               And he most definitely didn't know who
               was doing the hiring, only that they
               were paying a lot of money...

     There's a kind of general look around the table -- a nod or
     grunt of acknowledgement, indicating that all of these men
     were hired the same way.

                          SAM
                   (continuing his thought)
               So none of us knows who's paying the
               freight, this is just some anonymous job.
               For all we know, we're working for
               different people.

                          GREGOR
               Now that is an interesting proposition.

                          SWEDE
               How so?

                          GREGOR
               Because if there's more than one party
               involved, if we really are working for
               different people, then perhaps some of us
               are on different sides.
                   (with great meaning)
               Your orders might be different from mine.

                          LARRY
               What're you talking about, man?  I don't
               understand.

                          SWEDE
                   (quietly, but loud enough to be
                    heard)
               What a surprise...

                          LARRY
               I got a surprise for you, blondie...

                          GREGOR
                   (sharply, as if he's used to
                    giving orders)
               Why don't both of you shut up?

                          LARRY & SWEDE
                   (to Gregor at the same time)
               Fuck you!

                          SAM
               Knock it off!

     There is a BEAT.  Gregor, Swede and Larry look at Sam, who
     glares them all down.  Lastly, Sam turns and looks at
     Vincent.  The two men nod at one another, acknowledging a
     kind of mutual respect.

                          SAM
               The point remains: we could be working
               for different people.  There's a chance
               for one of us...
                   (looks around the table)
               Maybe more than one of us -- has been
               paid to cross the others.  I don't know
               about you guys, but I like to know who
               I'm working for.  It can help prevent a
               great deal of...
                   (finding the right word)
               ...unpleasantness.

                          LARRY
                   (patting the gun inside his
                    cheap suit)
               Anybody tries to unpleasant me I'll put
               two between his eyes -- one to do the job
               and the other to make sure it takes.

     From OFF SCREEN we hear a new sound: LAUGHTER.  ANOTHER ANGLE -

     Deirdre has entered the bar, and she's amused by this last
     exchange.

                          DEIRDRE
               It's good to see you've all got such
               faith in our little undertaking.

                          LARRY
               Who the fuck are you?

                          DEIRDRE
                   (staring at Larry)
               The name is Deirdre, and I'm running this
               show.

                          GREGOR
               Who are you?  IRA?

                          DEIRDRE
                   (with a brittle laugh)
               Not likely.  Once, yeah, I was -- but
               there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and
               I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my
               meaning.  I'm a hired gun, same as the
               rest of you, and that's all any of us
               needs to know about the other.

     Deirdre hands out several thick envelopes.  Larry and Swede
     open theirs and stare at the wads of Franc Notes stuffed
     inside.  Even Gregor cracks his envelope and peaks at his
     money.  But neither Vincent nor Sam takes a look.

                          DEIRDRE
               From here on in you want something you
               pay cash for it: no credit cards, no bank
               accounts are in place: ten percent up
               front, the rest when the job is done.
                   (a quick beat, then she looks
                    at Gregor)
               You.  What do you do and what should we
               call you?

                          GREGOR
               These days they they call me Gregor -- and
               I'm a tech.  I do electronic work,
               surveillance, computer runs.

     Deirdre turns to Sam.

                          SAM
               Sam.  I'm a weapons guy.

                          DEIRDRE
               You were a soldier, were you?

                          SAM
               Once.

     Deirdre gives Sam a look -- and he returns it.  Finally,
     Deirdre turns to Larry.

                          LARRY
               I drive -- and my name is Larry.  Larry
               from the States.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (she turns to Vincent)
               And who are you?

                          VINCENT
               I'm Vincent.  And I coordinate.

                          SAM
                   (sharply)
               Coordinate what?

                          VINCENT
               Things.  This is my country, you know.

     The two men exchange another look.  A pecking order is
     developing among the group: Vincent and Sam are both natural
     leaders, and now they're feeling one another out.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (to Vincent)
               Coordinate all you want, but make sure
               whatever you do gets cleared through me.
                   (Vincent doesn't respond for a
                    moment)
               Are we in sync on this, Vincent?

                          VINCENT
               Of course.

     Deirdre waits a BEAT, letting Vincent know what she isn't any
     more intimidated by him than he is by her.  Finally, she
     turns to Swede.

                          SWEDE
               They call me Swede.

                          LARRY
               Who's they?

                          SWEDE
               Everybody.

                          VINCENT
               And what is it you do?

                          SWEDE
               Me?
                   (with a smile)
               I kill.

     CUT TO:

     INT. A WAREHOUSE - DAY

     A PAPER TARGET, in the shape of a human being, dances in
     place as it is riddles with GUNSHOTS, each shot hitting the
     target in the belly, each shot fired by - Larry, whose been
     shooting a sleek automatic pistol from which he's just
     discharged an entire clip.  The gun is empty, Larry turns to
     Sam, who stands next in line.

                          SAM
                   (looking at the target)
               You shoot alright.

                          LARRY
               Gets the job done.

                          SAM
               All in the stomach, though.  Your man
               might live.

                          LARRY
               Not for long.

                          SAM
               Long enough to shoot back.

                          LARRY
               Is that right?

                          SAM
               It's been known to happen.

                          LARRY
                   (a challenge)
               Why don't you go do better, then...

     Without a word, Sam pops a new clip into the gun and SHOOTS
     THE LIGHTS out of several other human targets, hitting each
     target in a different place.  One he clips between the eyes,
     the next in the heart, one in the groin, and then the last
     target - He SPLITS DOWN THE MIDDLE, firing shot after shot
     from the head to the groin until the target is sheared in
     half.  Larry is impressed in spite of himself.

                          LARRY
               Yeah, well...  My way works too.

                          SAM
               My way is better.

     IN A CORNER OF THE WAREHOUSE -

     Gregor has set up a table loaded with computers and
     electronic whizmos.  Right now Gregor is holding a
     particularly high-tech type CELL PHONE in his hands, looking
     at it almost lovingly.

                          DEIRDRE (O.S.)
               Is it alright?

     ANOTHER ANGLE - Deirdre sits nearby, looking at the cell
     phone.

                          GREGOR
               It's quite satifactory.

                          DEIRDRE
               Good, because it cost enough.  There's
               cheaper phones by far than that one, man:
               you better fucking use it.

                          GREGOR
                   (almost caressing the phone)
               I intend to.  This phone is wired like no
               other: it's got an encryption chip and
               instant sat-a-link recognition, it can
               talk to any computer in any language and
               make it understand.  With my custom
               hardware and this phone I can trace the
               target's cell phone signature and follow
               him anywhere he goes...

                          DEIRDRE
               You sure about this?

                          GREGOR
               I'd stake my reputation.

                          DEIRDRE
               But would you stake your life, that's the
               question...

                          GREGOR
               In this business, your life and your
               reputation are more often than not one
               and the same.

     From off screen we hear MUNCHING.  It's - Larry inhaling a
     sandwich.  A malicious look comes over Swede's face, who's
     cleaning a pistol and sitting near Larry.

                          SWEDE
               You should watch what you eat.

                          LARRY
               Who the fuck died and appointed you food
               czar?

                          SWEDE
               I'm just worried about your health,
               Larry.  You could stand to shed a few
               pounds.

                          LARRY
                   (sensitive about his weight)
               And you could stand to get a little
               smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde
               fuck?

                          SWEDE
                   (sensitive about the dumb
                    blonde thing)
               Who you calling dumb, dickless?

     Both men eyeball one another, and then suddenly Larry reaches
     for his piece, and as soon as he does this Swede does the
     same thing, but before they can do anything - DEIRDRE'S GUN
     swings INTO FRAME, smashing Swede in the face and dropping
     him to the floor.  Larry's mouth drops open in surprise, but
     it's too late: Deirdre kicks him in the stomach and then
     rabbit punches him in the back of the neck, driving him to
     the ground.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (standing above them)
               Next one of you fuckers plays this game
               I'm going to do for you myself.  I won't
               say it again: we don't have time for this
               shit!  There's a clock running on this
               job, gentlemen, and I mean to be on
               schedule.

     A TENSE MOMENT as Deirdre stares down at these tough guys --
     letting them know who's in charge.  A SOUND from OFF SCREEN
     interrupts this moment: a DOOR opening, as we see - Vincent,
     who stands in the door, wearing his coat and hat.

     He's been out somewhere, and he looks first at the squabbling
     men, and then at - Deirdre.  She gives Vincent a little nod --
     a silent command that makes Vincent turn to Sam.

                          VINCENT
               Let's go for a ride.

     Vincent and Sam start off, moving towards the door, while Swede
     and larry slowly pick themselves up off the ground.

                          SAM
               Where to?

                          VINCENT
               To see a man about a thing.

                          SAM
               I can do that.

     EXT. THE WAREHOUSE - SUNSET

     A DESOLATE URBAN LANDSCAPE - Sam and Vincent walking away
     from the warehouse, which is housed in what looks to be the
     toughest neighborhood in the city, filled with CHEAP CONCRETE
     PUBLIC HOUSING and INDUSTRIAL BUILDINGS.

     THE SETTING SUN throws a red glow on the street, giving the
     raw concrete buildings a blood-colored tint, as Sam and
     Vincent approach a FIAT, a car neither too old nor too new.
     Before they can reach the car, the two men are intercepted by
     FOUR TOUGHS, young guys in their early twenties.  The LEADER
     of the Toughs apporaches Vincent.

                          LEADER
                   (subtitled French)
               Who gave you permission to park here?

                          SAM
                   (to Vincent)
               What's he saying?

                          VINCENT
               Pretty much what you'd expect.

                          SAM
                   (with a sigh)
               That's what I thought.

                          LEADER
                   (in French)
               There's a charge for parking on our
               block.

     The other Toughs add lib a few tough guy remarks (in French,
     of course).

                          VINCENT
                   (to Sam)
               He says this is their block.

                          SAM
               As in, they own it?

                          VINCENT
               Something like that...

                          SAM
               And I suppose he's saying that we oughta
               give them something for using it, huh?

                          VINCENT
               I didn't know that you spoke French.

                          SAM
               I don't.  But the language he's speaking
               is universal.

     ANGLE ON THE LEADER - Who's smirking at Vincent and Sam.
     Sam's words make a great deal of sense: the Leader is
     speaking the universal language of "give me some money or
     I'll kick your ass."

                          SAM (O.S.)
               I guess we oughta give them something...

     CUT BACK TO: Vincent and Sam.

                          VINCENT
               If you think we should.

     Vincent backfists the Leader in the nose -- hitting him so
     hard that the Leader skitters back on unsteady feet and then
     sits down on his ass.  This blow hurt, but the real damage is
     to the Leader's pride.  Now - One of the Toughs rushes at
     Sam, only to have Sam perform what looks like a jujitsu throw
     which savagely jerks the Tough off his feet and flattens him.

                          SAM
                   (as if it were an accident)
               Oh man, I am sorry about that...
                   (he sticks his hand out)
               Let me give you a hand.

     Sam reaches down as if to help the Tough, who ignores the
     hand and totters to his feet.  As soon as he's up he turns
     and runs away, followed by the other Toughs.  Now only the
     leader is left behind.  He looks for a second at Vincent and
     Sam, and then turns and runs after his friends.  Vincent
     calls after him in French, but whatever he says isn't
     translated.  Vincent turns to unlock the car.

                          SAM
               What'd you say to him?

                          VINCENT
               I asked if we could give him anything
               else.

     By now the two men are in the car, which starts up and drives
     off, as it does we -

     CUT TO:

     INT. THE FIAT - SAME TIME

                          VINCENT
               That was a nice move you did on our young
               friend.  Judo?

                          SAM
               Jujitsu.

                          VINCENT
               Same thing, isn't it?

                          SAM
               Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.

                          VINCENT
               What's the difference?

                          SAM
               One's a lot more painful than the other.

     Vincent laughs, and Sam looks out the window at the city of
     Paris as we MOVE THROUGH to the outside world of -

     EXT. PARIS DRIVING MONTAGE - TWILIGHT

     A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS of the car driving through Paris at
     night.  We don't see familiar sights like the Eiffel Tower or
     the Arc de Triomph, but instead - We travel through the LEFT
     BANK, down a series of Mazy Alleys which twist and turn,
     filled with bistros, bars and falafel joints.  NEON SIGNS
     line the streets for as far as the eye can see.  Near the end
     of this trip we hear the SOUND OF A MATCH FLARING, followed
     by -

                          SAM (V.O.)
               Could I get one of those?

     INT. THE CAR - STILL DRIVING - SAME TIME

     Vincent is driving and smoking a cigarette.  He tosses his
     pack to Sam, but he seems a little surprised at Sam's
     request.

                          VINCENT
               Help yourself.
                   (quick beat)
               Since when do you smoke?

                          SAM
                   (lighting up)
               I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a
               week.

                          VINCENT
               A cigarette?  As in one?
                   (exasperated, almost to
                    himself)
               One cigarette a week, who smokes like
               that?

                          SAM
               I do.

                          VINCENT
               Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day,
               and I tell myself I could be worse.
                   (takes a satisfying drag)
               It's just so damned pleasurable.

                          SAM
                   (blowing a smoke ring with
                    great skill)
               It has it's moments.
                   (stubs out cigarette)
               Course, you get cancer and die, that's
               the down side.

                          VINCENT
                   (with a sigh)
               There is that.

     Vincent stamps his cigarette out, looking vaguely unhappy
     that Sam has spoiled his smoke.

                          SAM
               So, Vincent: why bring me along for the
               ride?  Job like this calls for a warm
               body, somebody who can stand around and
               look threatening.  A tough guy.

                          VINCENT
               Like Larry or Swede.

                          SAM
               Exactly.  Why not bring them?

                          VINCENT
               Let's just say I thought the
               conversational possibilities were
               limited.  Of course, I might have brought
               Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right
               candidate -- for this.

                          SAM
               Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for
               sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB.  He's
               smart, Gregor is.

                          VINCENT
               So is the woman.

                          SAM
               Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously
               goddamned dangerous.

                          VINCENT
               I wonder if she truly left the IRA.

                          SAM
               I've wondered that myself.  None of this
               answers my question, though...
                   (suddenly direct)
               Why bring me?

                          VINCENT
               I wanted to see who you were.

                          SAM
               Who am I?

     Vincent, driving all the while, gives Sam a sideways glance
     before speaking.

                          VINCENT
               You were once some kind of special
               forces.  Airborne Ranger, maybe a Navy
               SEAL.  After that you rode shotgun for
               the CIA in some place like El Salvador or
               Afghanistan, a real mercenary.
                   (beat)
               Only now -- now you're like the rest of
               us, it's a very competitive market since
               the end of the cold war.  There's a lot
               of hired guns out here, and not nearly
               enough work to go around.

                          SAM
               That's right: there's not hardly enough
               work these days, nothing that pays the
               big money, anyhow.  Then along comes this
               job, paying so much goddamned money I
               couldn't afford not to take it.  Somebody's
               paying through the nose for this.

                          VINCENT
               They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're
               going to steal, it must be quite
               something.

                          SAM
               Whatever it is it must be goddamned
               priceless.

     And on that thought we -

     CUT TO:

     EXT. A SIDE STREET - NIGHT

     The Fiat pulls up to the curb and Vincent and Sam get out.
     Vincent leads Sam around a corner and they come to -

     AN EXQUISITE PARK, a small, perfectly manicured place -- a
     kind of mini-Luxembourg Gardens in the middle of nowhere.
     When Sam sees the park, he draws an involuntary breath.

                          VINCENT
               Lovely, isn't it?

                          SAM
               They'd have to keep something like this
               under lock and key in New York, and it
               would still get fucked up.

     The two men enter the park, which is, indeed, open to the
     public.  Inside, sitting on a bench in the back, almost
     invisible from the street, we see - FRANCOIS, a stubble-faced
     tough with a stained shirt and bad teeth.  Vincent and Sam
     draw near.  This next conversation between Francois and
     Vincent is in FRENCH WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES.

                          FRANCOIS
               That's good right where you are, Vincent.

     Vincent signals for Sam to stop.  Both Vincent and Sam are
     still several feet away from Francois.

                          VINCENT
               Do you have it?

                          FRANCOIS
               Not so fast.
                   (nods slightly to Sam)
               Who's that?

                          VINCENT
               He's company.

                          FRANCOIS
                   (as if he recognizes Sam)
               Bad company...

                          VINCENT
               What do you mean?

                          FRANCOIS
               He's a cop, Vincent, he's French and he's
               a cop and you better shoot him in the
               fucking head right now!

     Sam hasn't said a word -- he doesn't seem to understand
     what's been said, but he has noted the urgency with which
     Francois spoke.  Now - We HOLD FOR A BEAT.  Neither Vincent
     nor Francois pulls out a piece to shoot Sam.  Instead they
     wait to see if Sam will respond in any way to what Francois
     said.  The conversation now switches to ENGLISH, which (it
     turns out) Francois speaks fairly well.

                          SAM
                   (to Vincent)
               What's going on?

                          VINCENT
               I just wanted to see something.

                          SAM
                   (that edge creeping into his
                    voice)
               See what?

     Vincent isn't going to answer, but the overbearing Francois
     chimes in.

                          FRANCOIS
               He wanted to see how you reacted when I
               said that you were a cop.

                          SAM
                   (he can't believe this)
               You told him I was a cop?

                          FRANCOIS
               He asked me to say it.

                          SAM
                   (looking at Vincent, truly
                    pissed)
               He asked you to?

                          VINCENT
               I needed to know.

                          SAM
               You need to know a lot of shit, Vincent.

                          FRANCOIS
                   (to Vincent, in subtitled
                    French)
               Are you ready?

     Francois's French words give Sam pause -- he's wondering
     what's being said, as - Vincent moves towards Francois,
     leaving Sam several steps away.  The conversation is again in
     SUBTITLED FRENCH.

                          VINCENT
                   (taking out an envelope)
               Here's yours.

                          FRANCOIS
               There's been a slight problem.

                          VINCENT
                   (immediately tensing)
               What's that?

     Francois gives the slightest of nods, indicating that Vincent
     should look towards a place perhaps thirty yards away -
     A COPSE OF TREES, where we see a SNIPER pointed a telescopic
     rifle at Vincent.

                          FRANCOIS
                   (still in subtitled French)
               If you say a word in English, Vincent, my
               friend with the high powered sporting
               rifle will shoot you in the throat.
               Sorry to screw you over like this, but
               the information you want might get me
               killed if I give it to you, and that's a
               price I'm not willing to pay.

                          VINCENT
                   (in French)
               I take it you still want the money...

                          FRANCOIS
                   (in English, with a grin)
               Of course.

     SAM'S POV: Looking at Vincent and Francois.

     The men are talking, and from here we can't really hear them
     speak.  All Sam can see is an earnest Vincent listening to
     Francois talk, almost as if Francois is giving Vincent
     instructions.  Now - Vincent reaches into his pocket,
     reaching for the envelope of cash he's carrying.  As he hands
     the money to Francois, Vincent uses his free hand to pull out
     his gun while - Sam already has his gun out -- somehow he
     figured out what was going on -- and now Francois looks on in
     stunned disbelief as -

     Sam fires a single shot, hitting Francois in the shoulder,
     driving him away from - Vincent, who now squeezes off several
     rapid fire shots at the sniper, while - Francois, bleeding
     but still very much alive, now has his piece free just as -
     The Sniper, his gun firing wildly into the air, falls to the
     ground, shot dead by Vincent, and now - Francois is drawing a
     bead on Vincent when - Sam hits Francois with a fusillade of
     bullets in the chest and now - A SINGLE SPENT BULLED CASING
     flies through the air in SLOW MOTION and lands on the ground,
     spinning around until it comes to a halt and - A HEAVY
     SILENCE FALLS, as the last echo of the last gunshot finally
     dies.  Vincent and Sam look at one another, see that they're
     still alive, and then look back at - The two men they've
     shot.  Francois isn't quite dead.  Blood bubbles from his
     lips as Vincent leans over him.  Again, they speak in
     SUBTITLED FRENCH

                          VINCENT
               Where's my information?

                          FRANCOIS
                   (with a grim smile, pointing to
                    his head)
               In here...

                          VINCENT
               Then you better find it in your heart to
               tell me, Francois, because while your
               death is inevitable, it still isn't
               decided how painful it's going to be.

     A LONG ANGLE - Vincent whispers in Francois's ear, whose grin
     blanches as he realizes Vincent means to hurt him.  Francois
     whispers something back and then - BANG.  Vincent shoots
     Francois in the head, killing him instantly.  Then Vincent
     bends down and retrieves the envelope of money which Francois
     had tucked inside his shirt.  As Vincent does this, Sam comes
     up from behind.

                          SAM
               Now would be a good time to get the fuck
               out of here.

     INT. THE FIAT - LATER/NIGHT

     The two men drive in silence for a moment.  Vincent lights a
     cigarette and offers one to Sam, who refuses.  Finally, Sam
     speaks.

                          SAM
               You know, what you pulled back there,
               that was bullshit.

                          VINCENT
               I needed to see if you were a cop.
                   (defensively)
               I'm a popular man with the police, Sam,
               and whenever they try to catch me they
               always do it with an inside guy -- some
               man on some job who seems more
               trustworthy than all the others put
               together.  And that's the guy you have to
               watch out for.
                   (beat)
               I hate cops...

                          SAM
                   (insulted that Vincent would
                    even consider it)
               Well I ain't a cop.

     A BEAT, the two men driving in silence.

                          VINCENT
               How did you know?

                          SAM
               Know what?

                          VINCENT
               That there was a gun pointed at me.

                          SAM
               I saw you look off when Francois nodded
               his head.  I figured he wasn't pointing
               out a particularly rare shrub, and the
               rest was easy.

                          VINCENT
               But how did you know I would have the
               presence of mind to pull my weapon
               when I did?

                          SAM
                   (as if it's obvious)
               Because that's what I would have done...

     CUT TO:

     EXT. AN APARTMENT HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER/NIGHT

     Vincent's Fiat is parked at the curb in front of this
     apartment house.  Vincent and Sam exit the car and move
     towards the house -- a silence hanging between them.  Right
     before they go into the house, Vincent takes out the envelope
     full of cash that was supposed to have been for Francois.  He
     thinks for a moment and then hands the whole envelope to Sam.

                          VINCENT
               You saved my life back there in the park.
               I know this doesn't begin to make it
               right between us...

     Vincent's voice trails off -- he doesn't know what to say.
     Sam takes the money out of the envelope -- half he keeps for
     himself, the other he gives to Vincent.

                          SAM
               What I did back in the park I did because
               we're working together -- we're on the
               same team.
                   (holding up the money)
               This is business -- this is work.  We did
               it together, we share the spoils, even
               split.

     Sam opens the door to the house, but Vincent has one last
     thing to say to him.

                          VINCENT
               I owe you a heavy debt.

     Sam almost smiles cynically at this: debts of honor don't
     seem to be something he believes in.

                          SAM
               Whatever you say.

     They enter the house and the door closes behind them.  A
     second later we hear -

                          DEIRDRE (V.O.)
               What'd you do with the money?

     INT. THE HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER

     Vincent and Sam sit with Deirdre in a room, alone.  They've
     told her about the park, and she seems a little pissed about
     all of this.

                          VINCENT
               We kept it...

                          DEIRDRE
                   (a little annoyed)
               Is that right?

                          SAM
               Hazard pay...

                          DEIRDRE
                   (with an exhalation of disgust)
               The two of you were supposed to go to a
               simple meet and come back with a simple
               piece of information, and instead you
               went to fucking war...

                          SAM
               We weren't real thrilled about it
               either...

     Deirdre shakes her head in disgust and rises.  We FOLLOW HER
     INTO -

     AN ADJOINING ROOM -

     Where Larry, Swede and Gregor are waiting.  They look up
     expectantly at Deirdre, who crosses through the room without
     stopping -- she's really pissed about this turn of events.

                          LARRY
               So what's the deal?

                          DEIRDRE
                   (barely stopping, very
                    snappish)
               The deal?  The deal is we leave for Nice
               at first light.

     And she exits, leaving these three men behind along with Sam
     and Vincent, who have entered from the other room.  larry
     looks at the two of them.

                          LARRY
               What'd you guys do?

     EXT. OUTSIDE THE HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

     A CAR sits, cloaked in shadows.  Inside sits our friend, the
     WATCHER.  Once again we see the Watcher's knife -- once again
     he manicures his nails with it, almost delicately, as he
     watches the House.  It's dark -- a single light glows behind
     a window on the third floor.  Sam's room.

     INT. SAM'S ROOM - SAME TIME

     Sam has pushed all the furniture aside to make enough room to
     do a martial arts form.  Right now he's frozen, one leg
     extended in a kick, balancing on the other leg.  Now - A
     KNOCK at his door -- seconds later, it opens.  Deirdre stands
     there, watching as Sam holds his position for a BEAT more,
     and then retracts his leg.

                          DEIRDRE
               I feel as if I've wandered onto the set
               of Enter The Dragon.  Could you teach me
               to do that?

                          SAM
               I didn't think to see you again tonight.
               You were pretty pissed.

                          DEIRDRE
               I still am.

                          SAM
               Is that right?

                          DEIRDRE
               That's right.

     Deirdre spings at Sam, throwing martial arts combinations at
     him: punch followed by kick, elbow strike followed by palm
     thrust.  Sam parries her blows as she drives him across the
     floor until he's got his back to the wall.  Their movements
     are controlled, but powerful, and there's something almost
     flirtatious about the whole thing.  Now -

     Deirdre throws one last punch which Sam ducks.  He slips
     behind her and suddenly they square off in earnest.  The
     previous martial arts stuff was a kind of choreographed
     exercise, but now - They spar for real -- they never hit one
     another, but they come awfully close, hands and feet whizzing
     through the air, throwing rapid-fire combinations and
     techniques.  They're not angry, but they're not kidding,
     either.  Finally - Deirdre feints a punch that distracts
     Sam's attention from - The KICK she throws right behind her
     punch, and she smiles as - WHUMP!  Sam wasn't distracted at
     all -- he drops to the ground beneath her kick and catches
     her standing leg with a sweep which takes her to the ground
     and now - She's trapped beneath him.  The two of them are
     breathing hard from the exertion, their faces close to one
     another, shining with sweat and excitement and - We've gone
     from flirting to an almost primal seduction, and with their
     faces only inches apart Deirdre leans in to kiss Sam, and
     he's about to meet her half way when he pulls back.

                          SAM
               Part of me says I should just look at
               this as a perk.  You know, a bonus.  But
               then I remember you're you -- Deirdre
               who used to belong to the IRA -- and it
               occurs to me that deceit and subterfuge
               come very naturally to you.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (kissing him very lightly)
               Nobody's saying they don't.

                          SAM
                   (returning the kiss, just as
                    lightly)
               And when I consider that, I have to
               wonder if you don't have some ulterior
               motive for being here, with me, right
               now.

                          DEIRDRE
               I probably do.
                   (pulling him close)
               But for the time being, I'm willing to
               forget about it...

     They finally kiss, slowly and then building in intensity, and
     as they start to make love the

     CAMERA MOVES UP - THROUGH THE BUILDING, floor by floor, until
     we've reached -

     EXT. A ROOFTOP GARDEN - MEANWHILE

     Deirdre and Sam are not the only ones indulging in
     extracurricular activities.  Up here in this rooftop garden
     we find Swede and Gregor talking in hushed tones.

                          GREGOR
               I would imagine that the great
               satisfaction in all of this will be
               killing the American.

                          SWEDE
                   (we know this isn't true)
               I hadn't thought about it.  Understand
               me, Gregor -- I take no pleasure in
               killing.  It doesn't bother me one bit,
               but I don't get off on it.

                          GREGOR
               A means to an end, is that it?

                          SWEDE
               That's it.

                          GREGOR
                   (he rises to leave)
               Then I guess we're set.

                          SWEDE
               There is one other thing...

                          GREGOR
               What's that?

     Suddenly Swede pulls Gregor down to the rooftop with a harsh
     THUD.  Within seconds he has his gun pressed to Gregor's
     head.

                          GREGOR
               What are you doing?

                          SWEDE
               Don't cross me...

                          GREGOR
               Nobody's going to do that!

                          SWEDE
               Really?

                          GREGOR
                   (truly frightened)
               I need you, Swede, I can't do this
               without you!

                          SWEDE
                   (beat, then he puts his gun
                    away)
               I just wanted to make sure you knew who
               you were dealing with.

                          GREGOR
               I do, I do...

     Swede is now on his feet, walking away, back into the
     apartment house.

                          SWEDE
                   (this is almost to himself)
               Just remember it, then.

     And he's gone.  And as soon as he is, we notice something
     strange about Gregor: he's not the least bit scared -- he
     laughs a little low laugh as we - 

     DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. THE HOUSE - DAWN

     GRAY LIGHT seeps in from the horizon, while inside in -

     INT. SAM'S ROOM - SAME TIME

     Deirdre is pulling her dress over her head.  Sam seems to be
     sleeping in his bed as she moves like a cat towards the door
     when -

     Sam's HAND reaches out, gently yet firmly, and takes her by
     the arm.

                          SAM (O.S.)
               No goodbye?

     ANOTHER ANGLE - Sam is somehow sitting up, wide awake --
     looking at Deirdre with a penetrating glance.

                          DEIRDRE
               Look, Sam, don't take it the wrong way
               when I tell you we won't be doing this
               again.

                          SAM
               You don't have to explain yourself to me,
               Deirdre.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (almost surprised by this)
               I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just
               that, for once, I want to.  when I was a -
                   (almost with a sneer)
               Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with
               any man it was deemed necessary for me to
               sleep with.  You know: any man who needed
               setting up.  Sometimes so we might
               blackmail him, sometimes so he could be
               killed.
                   (a quick beat)
               Sometimes so I could kill him myself.
               IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist
               organization, Sam.  To most of the men I
               with I was always the girl.  "Send the girl
               to do it."  "Tell The girl to take care of
               it."  "Have the girl fuck him."
                   (a quick beat)
               But I look at you and I get this feeling
               you take me for what I am: no more, no
               less.

                          SAM
               You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like
               me.

                          DEIRDRE
               Exactly.  And last night I wanted to be
               with someone who was just like me.

     Somewhere in all of this Deirdre has sat back down on the
     bed, and somehow now she's only inches away from Sam.
     They're lips brush and -

     A MUTED PHONE RINGS in a nearby room, breaking the moment.  A
     QUICK BEAT, then -

                          DEIRDRE
               I better be getting that.

                          SAM
               Duty calls?

                          DEIRDRE
                   (with a trace of a sigh)
               Just business.

     Deirdre gives Sam a light kiss on the lips and then she opens
     his door.  The muted phone is a little louder now.  Deirdre
     closes Sam's door as she exits, but - Sam reaches out a hand
     and catches the door right before it snaps shut.  He watches
     THROUGH THE DOOR CRACK as - Deirdre cross the hall and
     opens the door to her room, and now the phone rings loudly
     until the door shuts, muting the sound once again, shutting
     Sam out.  The phone stops ringing as Deirdre answers and as
     this happens Sam shuts his door and as the door closes we go
     to - BLACK.  Just for a second.  And then - BLINDING SUN hits
     us in the eyes as we find ourselves above -

     EXT. NICE - DAY

     A DAZZLING OVERHEAD MOVING SHOT, establishing that we've
     changed locales, moved to a place filled with sun and blue
     water and reflective surfaces: the Cote d'Azure.  We start to
     MOVE DOWN TOWARDS -

     EXT. A PRIVATE BEACH - NICE - MEANWHILE

     A TOPLESS GRANDMA reclines on a beach chair, soaking up rays,
     sipping a drinnk just delivered by a young stud of a WAITER.
     Nearby -

     AT A ROUND TABLE -

     A nice distance from anyone who might try to listen in, we
     find our group: Deirdre, Sam, Vincent, Gregor, Swede, and
     Larry.  Food and drink surround them.  Larry is, of couse,
     still eating.

                          DEIRDRE
               Now then, let's run through it one more
               time, shall we?
                   (to Gregor)
               What's your job?

                          GREGOR
               I use my cell phone to get computer
               access to the telecommunications
               satellite used by our target.  I trace
               his cell phone signature and use it to
               pin point his location as he moves
               through Nice, relaying that information
               to you.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (to Larry)
               Next.

                          LARRY
                   (a sigh, he's done this too
                    many times)
               You call me with the target's route, I
               follow along until we've reached the
               attack point and then I run his squag ass
               off the road.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (to Swede)
               Which leads us to...

                          SWEDE
               I ride with fat-boy...

                          LARRY
                   (under his breath)
               Eat shit and die slowly...

                          SWEDE
               After we stop the target car I get out
               and use the heavy artillery to kill the
               driver and his bodyguard.

                          LARRY
               I blast the lead car into oblivion...

                          VINCENT
                   (picking up)
               While Sam and I take out the back two
               cars...

                          DEIRDRE
               Leaving...

                          SWEDE
                   (picking it up)
               ...Leaving me to step in, drop the target
               in the back seat, and get the package...

                          DEIRDRE
                   (with a quick look at Sam)
               While...

                          SAM
                   (returning her look)
               ...While I back him up, making sure to
               get the package if something goes wrong
               and somebody takes Swede down.

     Nobody else seems to notice this look between them, but we
     should -- if only to note that there's something about the
     way Deirdre queries Sam about his role, and something about
     the way Sam answers her without overly reacting -- they're
     not flirting, but there's a kind of acknowledgment of the
     history they now have between them.  But -- nobody else
     notices, and Swede's line follows Sam's without breaking the
     flow of the dialogue.

                          SWEDE
               Nobody's taking me anywhere...

                          DEIRDRE
               And then...

                          LARRY
               Then Swede and I split with the package
               and meet you back at the rendezvous.

                          DEIRDRE
               And then...

                          VINCENT
               And then Sam, you and I clean up
               whatever's left to be cleaned.

                          DEIRDRE
               Very good.  Now all we have to do is live
               long enough to get paid.

     EXT. A POSH HOTEL - LATER - NIGHT

     A ROW OF ROOMS, each one with a light behind a shade.  Even
     as we watch the light in each room goes off: one two three
     four five six lights -- one for each member of the team.  The
     night before the big event nobody breaks curfew.

     ACROSS THE STREET -

     A BAR -

     Through the bar window we see the Watcher's silhouette.  A
     match flares as the Watcher lights a cigarette, REVEALING his
     face for the first time: weathered, sharp, treacherous.  THE
     MATCH goes out, and the Watcher's face FADES TO BLACK, and so
     do we.

     FADE IN ON:

     EXT. THE HILLS OF NICE - MORNING

     A PRIVATE ESTATE IN THE HILLS -

     A CARAVAN OF BLACK ARMOR PLATED CARS, all idling, ready to
     pull out, filled with muscular men in suits with bluges under
     their jackets, all of them waiting for - THE TARGET.  Except
     we've seem him before and he wasn't called the Target: he was
     the Killer from the first scene of the film: the gunman in
     the cathedral who made off with -  THE BRIEFCASE.  Which the
     briefcase is still handcuffed to his side.  Now the Target
     gets into his car, a BLACK MERCEDES, and as soon as he's in
     the caravan pulls out and - The Target takes out his cell
     phone, punches in a number and starts to talk, and as he does
     we - PULL BACK, INTO THE AIR, leaving the Caravan behind as
     we MOVE TOWARDS THE WATER and -

     THE PROMENADE DES ANGLAIS, the long roadway that runs the
     length of the town adjacent to the beach.  It's a special
     place, a huge road for cars, along with a promenade for
     tourists.  Here we come upon -

     AN OUTDOOR CAFE -

     Where we find Deirdre, a laptop in front of her, wearing a
     HEADSET.  And, lest we think she looks out of place, we get
     a look at -

     THE REST OF THE CAFE -

     Where many of the other PATRONS are typing away on laptops,
     or chattering like crazy on their cell phone.  She types a
     sentence on her keyboard, and as she types she says it out
     loud.

                          DEIRDRE
               Alright, Gregor, I'm...

     CUT TO:

     INT. A CRAMPED COMPTUER CONTROL ROOM - SAME TIME

                          GREGOR
                   (finishing her sentence)
               Ready when you are...

     Gregor is sitting behind a console, looking at Deirdre's
     message, which we can read on his laptop.  Gregor also has a
     much bigger COMPUTER with him as well, and on this screen we
     see - A COMPUTER GRAPHIC MAP OF NICE.  This is a map of
     incredible detail, a high-tech graphic rendering of Nice.
     Now - THE MAP starts to shift, randomly moving about the city
     as it searches for the proper signal.  The computer isolates
     an entire district of the city, enlarges a part of the
     district, and then locates and enlarges a single street.  Now
     - On screen a FLASHING CURSOR appears on the map, the TARGET.
     The Cursor starts to move down one of the streets of Nice and
     as we follow the Curson it TURNS INTO - THE TARGET CAR,
     driving home the point that Gregor is now locked onto the
     Target.  THE JAPANESE DRUMS we heard in the opening sequence
     start to play again -- softly, ominously, and we're on -

     EXT. A SIDE STREET

     Where VINCENT'S FIAT is parked at a curb, Sam and Vincent
     sitting inside.

     INT. THE FIAT

     Vincent sits behind the wheel, while Sam sits next to him,
     loading a small arsenal of weapons.

     The DRUMS grow, a little louder now, a little more urgent.

     EXT. ANOTHER STREET

     A VOLVO idles, waiting for something, Larry behind the wheel
     of this car, and sitting next to him Swede.  The DRUMS
     continue to play, and their volume is still low, but they're
     jarring, setting our nerves on edge.

     INT. THE VOLVO

                          LARRY
               Where is this broad?

                          SWEDE
               You should learn a little patience.

                          LARRY
               Is that right?

                          SWEDE
               It's consider a virtue in some corners
               of the world.

                          LARRY
               Not in mine.

     THE CAR PHONE rings, and Swede pushes a button.  Deirdre's
     Voice is heard on the speaker phone.

                          DEIRDRE (V.O.)
               Hello gentlemen, are we ready?

     EXT. THE CAFE

     Deirdre looks at her laptop and relays Gregor's instructions.
     She speaks over her headset as if she's conducting ordinary
     business -- as if she's giving someone traffic directs
     over the phone.  The JAPANESE DRUMS continue, quiet and yet
     intense.

                          DEIRDRE
               You want to take a left, then, so that
               you're going west.

     During this next sequence, the DRUMS will continue to play,
     building with the action as we do -

     THE CHASE MONTAGE: A SERIES OF CUTS AS -

     The Volvo takes a flying left turn -

     Gregor watches the Target on his computer as it moves towards
     the Promenade des Anglais, typing the results on his
     keyboard as - The Volvo careens down a steep hill, hits a
     bump, and flies through the air a good fifteen feet, even as -
     The Fiat follows close behind and hits the same bump, does
     the same flight through the air and lands with a thud -

     THE CARAVAN of cars -

     THE TARGET CAR -

     THE TARGET, still talking away on his cell phone - THE
     COMPUTER MAP tracking the Target's movements, as the Map
     shifts and moves as it keeps pace with the target, and now -

     The Promenade des Anglais is right ahead and the DRUMS build
     to a crescendo as -

     The Volvo SMASHES into the Target Car and they grind
     together, as -

     CARS 3 & 4 in the Caravan are cut off by Vincent's Fiat,
     which forces them to slam to a halt, as -

     Larry runs the Target Car to a halt and the JAPANESE DRUMS
     stop.

     Larry and Swede hop out of the Volvo, and Swede brandishes a
     MONSTER of a MACHINE GUN, with which he opens fire, a blast
     of huge guage shells spitting a trail of fire, smashing
     against THE WINDSHIELD of the Target Car, which is bullet-
     proof.  The windshield doesn't break right away -- but the
     heavy blast of firepower causes the windsield to buckle.

     Sam and Vincent are now out of the Fiat, guns drawn, blazing
     away at BODYGUARDS, and Christ, there's an army of them,
     pouring out of Cars 3 & 4.  These guys are armed and returning
     fire as -

     Larry gets out of the driver's seat of the Volvo, and he's
     got some kind of sumbitch weapons himself, a ROCKET LAUNCHER,
     which he points and fires - And now we TRACK THE MISSLE as
     it scorches the air, traveling towards -

     The LEAD CAR of the caravan which has only now realized
     what's going on behind it, and as frantic Bodyguards drive
     back towards the carnage - The Missle IMPACTS, blowing the
     Car sideways.

     Meanwhile - Sam and Vincent are taking out the Other
     Bodyguards, and these guys are warriors -- they moves as a
     team, each man with a gun in both hands, using a weapon until
     it's out of bullets and then discarding it in favor of a new
     one.

     And even as this is going on - Deirdre has joined the fray,
     firing both of her pistols, taking Sam's place at Vincent's
     side so that Sam can run towards -

     The Target Car, where the Target is seated in the backseat,
     pulling out his own piece, ready to fight to the death
     himself as -

     Swede continues blasting away at the windshield with his
     monster gun, and now - The Windshield has started to crack
     and splinter, and abruptly, it shatters, instantly bursting a
     bright red as Swede's bullets tear up the body of the Driver.

     Now Sam has reaches the Target Car, just as the Target, who
     is armed and, as we know, not exactly helpless, steps out of
     the car and sights in on Swede and - ZING!  Sam fires,
     winging the Target, knocking the gun out of his hand and
     still the Target won't give up without a struggle, he hits
     Swede with the Briefcase.

                          THE TARGET
               Fuck you!

                          SWEDE
               Not today.

     BANG.  Swede puts one shot between the Target's eyes, ending
     his life.  Now - Swede takes out a DAI-SHO, the smaller of the
     two traditional Japanese Samurai swords.  With one slashing
     blow he hacks off the Target's HAND AT THE WRIST and grabs
     the briefcase.  The SEVERED HAND is still caught in the
     handcuffs, so that it is carried along for the ride.  Now -
     DISTANT SIRENS sound from OFF SCREEN as Swede moves back
     towards Larry and the Volvo, and as he goes he raises the
     briefcase (with its severed hand) in a kind of mock salute to
     Sam, who starts to move back towards Deirdre and Vincent, who
     have taken care of the remaining Bodyguards, and now the
     SIRENS are growing closer as we - START TO MOVE IN SLOW
     MOTION as Swede approaches the Volvo and - Deirdre and Vincent
     are already at Vincent's Fiat, waiting for Sam, and so they
     don't notice that - A VAN has been parked nearby this entire
     time, and now the van's side door slides open, and unseen by
     any of the others - Gregor steps out of the Van, a gun at his
     side, and a predatory look on his face as - Swede reaches Larry
     and the Volvo just as - Sam has reaches the Fiat, and now he looks
     back and sees - Gregor, crossing the street, and now - Sam
     screams a warning to Larry, but it's way too late because -
     Swede shoots Larry in the neck, hitting him above the
     protective covering of his bullet proof vest.  Now we're
     MOVING IN REAL TIME as - Larry manages to get his backup
     piece drawn, a snub-nosed .38, and he fires all six shots
     into - Swede, hitting him in the stomach -- it's the same way
     Larry shot the target in the warehouse.  Swede is sent flying
     backwards, where he crashes to the pavement.  For a second we
     think he's dead, but then he gets up, in pain but alive, just
     as Sam predicted.  Swede claws at his shirt to reveal that he
     too wears a bullet proof vest.  By now - Larry has rolled out
     of the Volvo, crawling away but too weak to go far, and now -
     Swede has Larry in his sights, he's going to kill him.

                          SWEDE
               I don't particularly like killing, tubby,
               but I want you to know that this one I'm
               going to enjoy.

                          LARRY
                   (sees something over Swede's
                    shoulder)
               I don't think so.

     Swede turns to follow Larry's gaze, and as he does - Gregor
     walks INTO FRAME and puts his gun right beneath Swede's chin.
     Before Swede can even compute this, Gregor pulls the trigger,
     firing straight up into Swede's brain.  Then, without even
     looking at Larry, who is lying helpless on the ground -
     Gregor takes the briefcase and gets into the Volvo, driving
     off just as - Sam arrives, kneeling down by Larry.  The SIRENS
     get louder.

                          LARRY
                   (in shock)
               He just...I don't believe that son-of-
               a...

     Vincent's Fiat comes peeling to a halt in front of them,
     Vincent and Deirdre inside it as Sam manages to get Larry
     into the back seat.  Sam doesn't get in the car yet as Larry
     says -

                          LARRY
                   (still having trouble believing
                    it)
               We've been crossed...

     The SIRENS reach a crescendo as a group of GENDARMES arrive,
     charging with automatic weapons drawn.  Between the French
     cops and our heroes lies the shot up wreck of the Target Car,
     and now - Sam takes out a GRENADE, pulls the pin, and rolls
     it across the ground, beneath the Mercedes, which the cops
     have just reached.  Seconds later - The Car EXPLODES, cutting
     off the cops, and as this happens, Vincents puts the pedal to
     the floor and gets the fuck out of Dodge.  We start to SLOWLY
     PULL BACK on the remains of this battle: the dead bodies, the
     shot up cars, the broken glass, and that flaming, smoking
     hulk of a Mercedes in the middle of the street.

     DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. THE OLD CITY/NICE - SUNSET

     The FIREBALL of the car turns into a BLOOD RED SUN as it sets
     in the Western sky, tinting the stone buildings of the Old
     City a coppery red.

     We're MOVING THROUGH the Old City, through the twists and
     turns of what an American would call back alleys but that
     pass for streets in this place.  It is quiet almost deserted,
     then - A TESTOSTERONE CRAZED PLAYBOY whips his sports car
     through one of these streets, engine whining, as we - MOVE
     DOWN yet another side street, and this sucker really is a
     back alley, you couldn't get a car down here if you tried.
     Finally, we come to - A RAT TRAP OF AN OLD BUILDING, and we
     PUSH TIGHT on this building as we hear -

                          LARRY (V.O.)
               What is this?

     INT. A BACK APARTMENT - SAME TIME

     A SYRINGE is plunged into Larry's arm.  Sam is tending to
     Larry's wound.  Sam seems to know what he's doing, as Larry
     is also hooked up to a bottle of plasma hanging on a make-
     shift stand.

                          SAM
                   (answering Larry's question)
               It's a cocktail.  Mostly demerol, cut
               with a little crank because we might need
               you awake in the real near future.

                          LARRY
               Fine with fucking me, we got work to do.
               I don't care what it takes, we are
               getting our property back and putting it
               into the hands of the people who are
               gonna pay us a great deal of money when
               we do.  I don't know about the rest of you
               guys, but I'm not the kind of guy
               to just sit back and take it in the ass.
                   (a quick beat)
               I don't mean that in, like, a literal
               way...

                          DEIRDRE
               Of course.

                          VINCENT
               Finding this package is a thing easier
               said than done.  We don't even know what
               it is.
                   (he looks at Deirdre, and
                    suddenly he's deadly earnest)
               What did we steal?

                          DEIRDRE
                   (suddenly defensive)
               I don't know.

                          VINCENT
               When this whole thing started you made it
               clear: you're running the show.  And I
               don't believe you'd be running this show
               if you didn't know what was going on.

                          DEIRDRE
               Well I don't!

                          VINCENT
               And I don't believe you...

     Vincent's gun is out in the blink of an eye, at Deirdre's
     head, but she's as fast as he is and her gun is drawn as
     well, jammed into his stomach.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (suddenly feral) 
               You go shoot me if you want, Vincent, but
               you'll be dead before I hit the ground.

                          VINCENT
                   (matching her intensity)
               I don't want you dead, woman, I want the
               the truth!

                          SAM (O.S.)
                   (with a dead cool in his voice)
               Both of you...

     ANOTHER ANGLE - Sam has the two of them covered with his gun -
     an interesting moment, because he can shoot either Deirdre or
     Vincent, but not both at the same time.  The question is:
     whose side is he on?

                          SAM
                   (continuing without missing a
                    beat)
               ...put your guns down and chill out.

     A BEAT.  And then Vincent and Deirdre lower their weapons,
     followed by Sam.

                          SAM
               Like it or now, we're on the same side:
               we're here and the package isn't.
                   (looks at Deirdre)
               You're not the boss any more, you're our
               partner.  So tell us what you know, so we
               can figure a way out of this mess.

     Sam's look isn't romantic, but it implies a level of trust
     based upon their physical intimacy.

                          SAM
               Now, what did we steal?

                          DEIRDRE
                   (she hates to admit this)
               I don't know...
                   (defensively, off Vincent's
                    look)
               Well I don't!  It's a goddamned mystery
               to me just like it is to you.
                   (quick beat, then reluctantly
                    continuing)
               But I do know who we're working for.  My
               people, and the Russian mob.

                          LARRY
               Your people?  Who the fuck is your
               people?

                          VINCENT
               Who do you think, Larry?  The IRA.

                          DEIRDRE
               And you believed me?
                   (passionately)
               But it wasn't my people who did it.

                          LARRY
               How do we know that?

                          SAM
               Because if they had she'd be gone along
               with the package, instead of sitting here
               with us.

                          DEIRDRE
               Exactly.  Gregor, he was the Russian's
               man.  It was my people came up with the
               idea for this run, but the Russians who
               had the capital to finance it.  Gregor,
               he was their insurance, and I was ours.
               Everybody else was supposed to be
               neutral.  Gregor must've got to Swede...

                          LARRY
               I never did trust that blonde fuck...

                          DEIRDRE
               That's why you were riding with him.

                          VINCENT
               The question still remains: what do we do
               now?

                          SAM
                   (he figures something out)
               Gregor's cell phone...

                          LARRY
                   (to himself)
               What are you gonna do, call him up and
               ask him to give us back our shit?

                          SAM
                   (ignoring Larry, to Deirdre)
               Did he bring that with him?

                          DEIRDRE
               I bought it for him -- all the stuff he
               was using, it was in his contract.  Cost
               a nice penny, too, especially that
               goddamned phone: Gregor had expensive
               tastes.

                          SAM
               Check this out.
                   (he's thinking on his feet)
               Gregor's a spook, or he was one until
               recently.  When he was a spy he lived the
               life -- you know, a prince in some
               Eastern Bloc country where nobody had
               shit and Gregor had everything.  Then the
               wall goes down.  No more Cold War.  And
               Gregor is out of a job.  No apartment, no
               special stores with Western food and
               video tapes.  I would bet dollars against
               shit that Gregor liked that phone and he
               doesn't want to give it up.  And I
               wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant
               enough to think...

                          DEIRDRE
                   (finishing his sentence)
               That we're too stupid to trace his calls.

     Deirdre and Sam share the slightest of conspiratorial smiles
     as they realize they're both thinking the same thought: they
     might still win this one.

     EXT. AIX EN PROVENCE - TWILIGHT

     We're on perhaps the MOST BEAUTIFUL STREET in all of France:
     the Cours Mirabeau in the town of Aix.

     Outdoor cafes line the sides of the street, while a canopy of
     interlocking trees covers everything.  Now we're - MOVING,
     DOWN THE STREET, towards a CAFE, where a DAPPER GENT sits,
     sipping a mineral water.  The Gent has a SATCHEL at his feet.
     Now - A JEEP pulls up to a nearby corner and idles in
     neutral.  The Dapper Gent throws some bills on the table and
     gets up, crossing to - The Jeep.  A door opens, and the
     Dapper Gent, carrying his satchel, gets into the jeep, which
     drives off as we -

     CUT TO:

     INT. JEEP - SAME TIME

     Gregor and the Dapper Gent drive in silence for minute, down
     the length of the Cours Mirabeau.

                          GREGOR
                   (breaking the silence)
               It's a beautiful street, no?

     The Dapper Gent also has an accent, a much thicker one than
     Gregor's; it's an accent that places the Gent as a resident
     of what used to be called the Soviet Union.

                          DAPPER GENT
                   (he can't wait any longer)
               Do you have it?

                          GREGOR
               Always in a rush, you are.  All these
               years I've known you, you could never
               wait for anything.

                          DAPPER GENT
               This is important.

                          GREGOR
               Do you really think so?

                          DAPPER GENT
               You know it is.

     Gregor, still driving, takes out a SILENCED PISTOL, and the
     Dapper Gent reaches for his own piece.

                          GREGOR
               Relax!

     The Dapper Gent loweres his hand, leaving his gun in his coat.
     Gregor pulls the van to a curb.

                          GREGOR
               Look over there.

     GREGOR & THE GENT'S POV: THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD - A GROUP OF
     CHILDREN are playing.

                          GREGOR (O.S.)
               Do you see that one?  The girl in the
               light blue dress?

     We find one particular LITTLE GIRL, around eight, holding the
     end of a jump rope, wearing a light blue dress.  She's
     breathtakingly beautiful, and now - Gregor raises his
     silenced pistol, as if to shoot her.

                          DAPPER GENT
               What are you doing, have you lost your
               mind?!?

     Gregor pulls the trigger, as he does so the Dapper Gent jogs
     his arm, and we hear the soft thwpfft of the silenced shot
     just as the shot goes off - Missing its mark, harmlessly
     shooting into a tree, causing a SINGLE LEAF to float to the
     ground behind the playing children.  Nobody notices a thing.
     BEAT.  The Dapper Gent is visibly shaken, because there is no
     doubt that Gregor would have killed the Girl if the Gent
     hadn't ruined his aim.

                          DAPPER GENT
               Why did you do that?

                          GREGOR
               To make a point.  I don't know her, and I
               was ready to splatter her brains all over
               the sidewalk.
                   (giving the Gent a look)
               I don't particularly like you, so imagine
               what I'll do if you try anything...

     Gregor leaves his gun dangling in the air a moment longer than
     necessary and then starts the jeep as we -

     CUT TO:

     EXT. A COUNTRY ROAD OUTSIDE OF AIX - NIGHT

     A FULL MOON casts a silver light over a field of wild grass.
     A soft wind blows, and the grass moves gently from side to
     side.  Now - Gregor's JEEP glides down this road as we MOVE
     THROUGH TO -

     INT. THE JEEP - SAME TIME

                          DAPPER GENT
                   (squirming)
               Enough!  We've been driving for an hour,
               where is my package?

     Gregor smiles -- he's been waiting for this.  He pulls the
     jeep over and looks at the Dapper Gent.

                          GREGOR
               It's under your seat.

                          DAPPER GENT
                   (incredulous)
               What?

                          GREGOR
               As my American friend Larry would say:
               are you fucking deaf?  It's under your
               seat.

     The Dapper Gent looks down, and sure enough, the edge of the
     Briefcase sticks out beneath the seat.

                          DAPPER GENT
               I can't believe you'd do that, Gregor.  I
               thought I trained you better than that.

     With a laugh the Dapper Gent hands his satchel to Gregor,
     whose eyes literally dance with the prospect of his reward.
     He can't help himself, he opens the satchel and there it is -
     COLD HARD CASH in large bills, enough for Gregor to live like
     a prince for quite some time.  Gregor sucks in an involuntary
     breath and then looks back up to see - The Dapper Gent hasn't
     reached for the Briefcase.  Instead he's taken out his gun,
     and it's only inches from Gregor's head.

                          DAPPER GENT
               I've never particularly liked you either,
               Gregor.

     The Dapper Gent yanks out the Briefcase, and as he does -

     THE SEVERED HAND comes whipping out along with it, still
     attached by the handcuff chain.  The Hand flies up in the
     Dapper Gent's face, and we notice that the Hand is starting
     to rot -- it's bloated and swelling and horrific and it
     scares the shit out of the Dapper Gent, who drops his gun and
     fumbles with the Briefcase as - THWPFFT...we hear the sound
     of another silenced shot as we -

     SMASH CUT TO:

     EXT. OUTSIDE THE JEEP - SAME TIME

     A DARK STAIN splashes against the passenger side window of
     the jeep.  Seconds later - The door swings open, and the
     Dapper Gent's body plunks out onto the ground.  A moment
     later, something wet and viscous plops down on the face of
     the Gent as the jeep drives off.  Now - We HOLD FOR A BEAT on
     the Dapper Gent's dead body, which lies in the silver
     moonlight, blood running out from beneath him, while the
     Severed Hand palms the Gent's face, fingers splayed out
     around his head.  Now - We HEAR the sound of PHONE TONES.
     And not just any phone...

     INT. THE JEEP - SAME TIME

     Gregor finishes punching a number into his CELL PHONE.  We
     hear a single ring on the other end of the phone before it is
     picked up.

                          PHONE VOICE (V.O.)
                   (in Russian, English subtitles)
               Is it done?

                          GREGOR
                   (in English)
               It's done.

     BEAT.  The Phone Voice doesn't respond for a moment -- whoever
     this is they didn't expect to hear from Gregor.  The Voice
     switches to English.

                          PHONE VOICE (V.O.)
               Gregor, is that you?

                          GREGOR
                   (with a low chuckle)
               Much to your disappointment, no doubt.

                          PHONE VOICE (V.O.)
               It was a mistake, it shouldn't have
               happened.

                          GREGOR
                   (suddenly cold, furious)
               I'm in the middle of saving you people a
               great deal of money -- the least you
               could do is have the decency to pay me!

     BEAT.

                          PHONE VOICE (V.O.)
               So what do we do?

                          GREGOR
               What I do is none of your concern.  What
               you should do is wait for my next phone
               call.  I'm going to find a place where I
               can tilt the field in my favor.  When I'm
               ready, I'll call you and tell you what I
               want you to do.

     The Phone Voice says something unintelligible in Russian, cut
     off by Gregor as he angrily snaps off his cell phone and we -

     CUT TO:

     INT. THE CHEAP APARTMENT - DAWN

     Larry snores on the couch, while Deirdre sleeps in a sleeping
     bag on the floor.  Vincent sits in a ratty easy chair, feet
     propped on an overturned crate, dozing lightly.  Suddenly -
     Vincent's eyes open, warily, as if something has changed in
     the room.  He looks around - No Sam.  Vincent gets up, takes
     out his gun, and silently gets to his feet.  He moves down a
     long hall and - No Sam.  Now, like a cat, Vincent moves into -

     THE BATHROOM: pitch black.  He moves in, swipes the string of
     the overhead light and - nothing.  Nobody's here.  The only
     place left is the front door, and now Vincent approaches.  He
     opens the door, gun still at ready, and moves out into -

     INT. THE LANDING OUTSIDE - SAME TIME

     This is a small building.  There is no other apartment on
     the floor.  At the far end of the landing, there is a small
     ladder which leads up to -

     THE ROOF.  And the door which leads to the roof is flapping
     in a light wind.

     EXT. THE ROOF - SAME TIME

     Vincent bursts onto the roof, gun straight out, finger on the
     trigger, only to find - Sam is there, his gun pointed at
     Vincent.  A BEAT, then both men give little laughs and put
     their weapons away, like Samurai so trained in combat that
     they know when it's safe to relax.

                          SAM
               What's going on?

                          VINCENT
               You weren't around when I woke up, I
               thought maybe something had happened.
                   (off Sam's look)
               This has been one very fucked up job,
               Sam, and I'm not taking any more chances
               on anybody...
                   (a quick beat)
               Including you...

     In answer Sam takes out Vincent's pack of cigarettes and
     tosses them back to him.  Vincent looks almost delighted at
     this.

                          SAM
               I came up here to sneak a smoke.

                          VINCENT
               You were smoking?

                          SAM
               I hope you don't mind I took your pack.
               It was on the table.

                          VINCENT
                   (very sincere, offering the
                    pack)
               Please, help yourself.  Smoke as many
               you'd like.

     Sam considers for a minute, and then takes one.  Vincent does
     so as well, and he searches for his lighter, which he can't
     seem to find, because - Sam has it, and he lights their
     cigarettes, and then hands the lighter back to Vincent.

                          SAM
                   (a shrug of the shoulders)
               I borrowed that, too...

                          VINCENT
                   (puffing contentedly)
               Of course...whenever you feel like it
               just help yourself.

                          SAM
               I have a feeling I'm about to start
               buying my own.

     BEAT.  The two men smoke in silence, looking out at -

     THE CURVED SHORELINE OF NICE -

     Which glitters with thousands of lights from the apartment
     buildings, and a thousand more from the cars that travel on
     the road that leads into town: the Promenade des Anglais.

                          VINCENT (O.S.)
               That was a bad bit of business, today.

     BACK ON Sam and Vincent.

                          SAM
               It was at that.

                          VINCENT
               A lot of people died.

                          SAM
               I've seen a lot of people die before.

                          VINCENT
               I haven't.  Not like that.  How do you
               get used to it?

                          SAM
               You don't.  You just learn to live with
               it.

                          VINCENT
               I won't lie -- there have been times when
               I had to do it, times when the only way
               to get out alive was to see that the
               other man didn't.

                          SAM
               We live in a singular world, my friend.

                          VINCENT
               I never really thought I was part of the
               world you move in, Sam, to tell you the
               truth.
                   (off his look)
               I'm a hood, a thief.  Big time in a small
               time king of way.  To the local police
               I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a
               legend.  But to a guy like you I'm just
               another two bit hired gun.

                          SAM
               You might be a hired gun, Vincent, but I
               got a feeling you cost more than two
               bits.

     This conversation might have gone further, but it is
     interrupted when Deirdre pokes her head up onto the roof.

                          DEIRDRE
               Christ, I was starting to think that the
               two of you had thrown it in and walked
               away.
                   (to Vincent)
               There's someone on the phone downstairs
               asking for you, and my somewhat limited
               French leads me to believe that he might
               have something to tell us about Gregor.

     EXT. THE HIGHWAY - LATER - NIGHT

     A car we haven't seen before, a CITROEN, hums up the French
     highway in the night, along on the road.  It's a postcard
     moment, but only for a moment.

                          LARRY (V.O.)
               I'm telling you...

     INT. THE CITROEN - SAME TIME

                          LARRY
                   (continuing)
               That I could be dead and I'd drive better
               than you.

     Deirdre is driving, and Larry -- much to his chagrin -- is in
     the passenger seat, watching her every move.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (very curt)
               Oh shut up...

     IN THE BACK SEAT -

     Sam and Vincent have a MAP spread out.  Vincent is tracing
     Gregor's route so far, and we follow his RED MAGIC MARKER as
     it traces a line up the highway.

                          VINCENT
               He's going north.
                   (circles something on map)
               That's Aix en Provence, where he used the
               phone.

     Sam runs his finger along the length of the highway on the
     map.  Destination: Paris.

                          SAM
                   (making up his mind)
               He's going back.

                          VINCENT
               Not necessarily.  He could go off road at
               any number of places.  He might not even
               be in the country anymore.

                          SAM
               It's Paris.  The route's too indirect for
               anything else.  A guy like Gregor, he
               doesn't waste time on this road unless he
               has to be on it in the first place.
               Otherwise, he'd be out of the country by
               now.  He's going to Paris.
                   (beat)
               Now I just hope we can find him before he
               gets there.

                          DEIRDRE
               If somebody else doesn't find him first.

     EXT. THE TOWN OF ORANGE - DAY

     Orange, pronounced "Au-Ronge", is a mid-sized town of fifty
     thousand souls.  It is small, charming, quaint, and it has
     one particular thing that no other town in France can claim -

     AN ANCIENT ROMAN THEATER that has been painstakingly
     restored.  We see this Roman Theater from the outside, as we
     MOVE THROUGH the streets of the town, to the TOWN SQUARE.
     It's packed -- every seat in every outdoor cafe is filled
     with a tourist having breakfast.  This normally quiet place
     explodes one month out of the year, when an internationally
     famous music festival is held in the Roman Theater.  We come
     upon -

     A TABLE OF AMERICAN TOURISTS: a Family.  Dad is angry at Mom.

                          DAD
               Opera?  This is an opera festival?

                          MOM
               I told you that, Henry.

                          DAD
               I thought you meant Phantom of the Opera.
               You know, Andrew Lloyd Weber, Cats, that
               kind of thing.

     Mom and Dad continue their discussion, but we've left them
     behind, MOVING THROUGH the seats and cafes until we get to a
     cafe on the outskirts of the Town Square.  Here, in the most
     removed table in the entire Square, we find Gregor sitting in
     the shadow of the trellis.  Unless you're on top of him you
     can't see him, but he can see everything perfectly.  His cell
     phone sits on the table in front of him -- he picks it up and
     starts to punch in a number.

     CUT TO:

     EXT. A REST STOP ON THE HIGHWAY - MEANWHILE

     THE CITROEN is parked among a number of other cars.  Sam is
     sleeping in the back seat, while Vincent is seen on an
     outdoor pay phone at the other end of the parking lot.
     Deirdre and Larry sit at a nearby picnic table, eating French
     fast food, which we get a good look at as we - PAN THE LENGTH
     OF THE TABLE, which is covered with pasta, grilled sausages
     with dijon mustard, really good fried potatoes.

     In fact, everything that's on this table is so far beyond the
     imagination of your average American truck driver that Larry
     can't contain himself.  He's stuffing himself, washing
     everything down with the wine which is also sold at these
     road-side rest stops.  Deirdre drinks coffee.

                          LARRY
                   (mouth full)
               This...this is incredible. Is the rest
               of Europe like this?

                          DEIRDRE
                   (with a laugh)
               Some places, not all.  Italy, for
               instance, they're serious about their
               food.  But try bloody Britain, anywhere
               in the U.K., you don't get much fancier
               than a deep-fried bar egg.  Food's not
               our thing, you see.

                          LARRY
               What is?

                          DEIRDRE
                   (everybody knows this)
               Best beer in the world known to man or
               God.

                          LARRY
                   (with a snort)
               Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for
               me, thanks.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (with unconcealed scorn)
               Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and
               you've the unbridled gall to mention
               Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's
               not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor
               excuse for rabbit piss.

                          LARRY
               Oh yeah?  Whatta you drink, then?

                          DEIRDRE
               I drink what every civilized man, woman
               and child in the world drinks: Guinness.

                          VINCENT (O.S.)
               I hate to interrupt a conversation of
               such cultural depth...

     CUT AWAY TO REVEAL: Vincent -

     Who has finished his phone call and returned to join them.

                          VINCENT
               ...but we've got to get back on the road.

     Vincent raps lightly on the car window next to Sam's head --
     Sam's eyes shoot open: a light sleeper.  All eyes are on
     Vincent, who waits for a BEAT before he reveals his news.

                          VINCENT
               We've got him.

                          LARRY
               I'm driving.

     EXT. THE TOWN SQUARE - A LITTLE LATER - DAY

     Gregor is seated where we saw him last -- at the little table
     in the corner cafe.  He's been here for hours, observing the
     Town Square, and now, he finally sees what he's been looking
     for - TWO MEN, definitely not tourists here for the music,
     have entered the Square -- everything about these guys
     screams GUNMEN.  Now, as Gregor watches - A PUNKED-OUT TEEN
     comes up to the men and hands them a small envelope.  The
     Gunmen look around the Square, trying to see where Gregor is,
     but he's too far back in the shadows.  The Gunmen ask the
     Teen a question, to which the Teen can only shrug his
     shoulders.  Now - The Teen walks away, leaving the Gunmen to
     open the envelope and look at its contents, which are quickly
     read.  From OFF SCREEN we hear the sound of Gregor punching
     in a number on his cell phone.  Simultaneously, the Gunmen
     finish reading the instructions Gregor has sent them, and
     turn around to face - A PAY PHONE.  The phone rings, and one
     of the Gunmen goes to pick it up.

     EXT. ANOTHER STREET - MEANWHILE

     The Citroen pulls into town and slows to a crawl, cruising
     the streets, looking for Gregor.

     INT. THE CITROEN - SAME TIME

     Vincent stares out of the window and sees something that
     causes him to swear under his breath in French.  It's -

     The Gunmen walking down the street.

                          VINCENT
               I know those men.

     Sam frowns: he also seems to recognize at least one of the
     gunmen.  None of the others in the car notice Sam's reaction,
     but we do.  The Gunmen are heading straight for -

     EXT. THE ANCIENT ROMAN THEATER - MEANWHILE

     THE MID-AFTERNOON SUN shines down on the open air Roman
     Theater.  The theater itself is almost two thousand year
     old.  A semi-circle of seats surrounds a huge Stage Wall, a
     massive structure which is one of the best preserved of its
     kind in the world.  THE GUNMEN enter at the bottom of the
     theater, holding ticket stubs.  They are with a Tour Group
     led by an ANCIENT GEEZER who speaks in rapid-fire French.  As
     the tour moves off to see the Stage Wall, the Gunmen hang
     back and then separate from the crowd.

     EXT. OUTSIDE THE THEATER - SAME TIME

     THE CITROEN sits at a curb.  Larry sits behind the wheel of
     the car, the getaway driver with the motor running.  Vincent
     and Deirdre are already walking towards the Theater.  Sam
     stays behind for a second to say something to Larry.

                          SAM
               Whatever you hear, whatever happens, when
               your partners come back out, you make
               sure you're here with the motor running.

     And on that note Sam follows after Vincent and Deirdre.
     Larry doesn't notice it, but - THE WATCHER has found them.
     He's a block or so away, wearing a two-day stubble of beard
     and hugging the shadows of back alley.  Cradled in one hand,
     barely visible but ominously present: his knife, which for
     one moment catches a glint of sun that hits our eyes as we -

     CUT TO:

     EXT. INSIDE THE ROMAN THEATER - MEANWHILE

     The Gunmen have reached a point about midway up the coliseum-
     like staircase.  Behind them we can see the Tour Group,
     standing on the stage, being lectured to by the Ancient
     Geezer.  In front of them the Gunmen find -

     AN EXIT which leads to an interior hall.  Inside the exit
     it's dark, while a bright sun falls down on the Gunmen.  They
     look into the dark, unable to see a thing, while a voice
     come at them from out of the dark.

                          GREGOR (V.O.)
               Thank you, gentleman, that will do
               nicely.

     IN THE HALL -

     ON GREGOR.  It's dark in here.  There are no lights, no
     torches.  From the dark in here, he can look out and see -
     THE GUNMEN, who make plain targets, backlit as they are by
     the sun.  Now we CUT BACK AND FORTH between these two ANGLES,
     and it becomes clear that Gregor has chosen wisely -- he can
     see his quarry, but they can't see him.

                          GREGOR
               Edvard, is that you?

     EDVARD, the more dangerous looking of the two Gunmen
     responds.

                          EDVARD
               Yes, Gregor, they sent me.

                          GREGOR
               I'm touched, really, that they'd send
               someone of your caliber.  It's nice to
               know that they didn't make the mistake of
               underestimating me twice.

                          EDVARD
               That was a mistake, trying to kill you.
               Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd
               have never allowed it.

                          GREGOR
               I'm sure.  But I'm sorry to say that it's
               too late for trust: we have a serious
               problem.

                               EDVARD
               We'll double your price.

                          GREGOR
                   (now that's interesting)
               Really?  Do you have the money with you?

                          EDVARD
               Do you have the material?

                          GREGOR
               You first, Edvard.

                          EDVARD
               Perhaps we could both go at the same
               time...

                          GREGOR
                   (a short laugh)
               I think not.
                   (with a flourish)
               After you...

     A GUN COMES INTO FRAME, trigger cocked, the barrel placed to
     Gregor's temple.

                          SAM (O.S.)
               After you, asshole.

     Gregor stiffens, as we PULL BACK ON Sam, who has snuck up on
     Gregor and gotten the drop on him.

                          SAM
               You might have been one mean technical
               spook, Gregor, but you wouldn't have
               lasted a week in the field.

     CUT TO THE GUNMEN'S POV: Looking into the Tunnel - It's dark,
     they can't see a thing, but they've heard Sam's voice and
     they know something's wrong.

                          EDVARD
               Gregor, are you alright?

                          DEIRDRE (O.S.)
               Gregor's fine...

     CUT AWAY TO REVEAL: Deirdre -

     She's snuck up on the Gunmen, weapon drawn.

                          DEIDRE
                   (continuing)
               ...but I think you're in a bit of
               trouble.

     The Gunmen reach for their pieces and as they do -

                          VINCENT (O.S.)
               Don't even think it.

     CUT AWAY TO REVEAL: Vincent - And his piece is also out --
     the Gunmen are trapped, and they know it.  Now we notice that
     - The Ancient Geezer and his Tour Group are coming towards
     us.  Meanwhile, back in -

     THE TUNNEL -

     Sam is grilling Gregor furiously, his gun still to Gregor's
     head.

                          SAM
               Don't talk to me unless you tell me what
               I want to hear, understand?!?  You have
               no choice in this, don't think about
               winning, think about staying alive.  I
               want the item, and if you don't give it
               to me, I'm gonna kill you.

                          GREGOR
                   (a panicky hiss)
               I don't have it with me...

                          SAM
               Bullshit!

                          GREGOR
               I swear...

                          SAM
               Then where is it?

                          GREGOR
               I sent it to myself in Paris.

                          SAM
               Sent it where?

                          GREGOR
               A post office box.

     Suddenly Gregor runs forward, towards the exit.  Sam runs
     after him, tackling him just as they reach - THE OUTSIDE,
     where the two men roll into plain sight of - The Gunmen, who
     are still covered by Vincent and Deirdre.  Now we notice -
     That the Ancient Geezer and his Tour Group are really close,
     no more than ten yards away, as - Sam has Gregor pinned face
     first on the ancient stone of the theater.  He looks up at
     the others, and that's when it happens - Edvard looks at Sam
     and recognizes him.

                          EDVARD
                   (stunned, announcing to the
                    group)
               Do you know who he is?  He's with
               Interpol, the Internation Police.  He's
               a cop.

     A SLOW MOTION BEAT.

     Vincent and Deirdre don't know what to make of this, their
     heads turn to look at Sam, and in this instant - The Tour
     Group walks into their midst and - The 2nd Gunman reaches for
     his piece and - Sam FIRES his gun at the 2nd Gunman, and with
     the sharp report of the pistol we move back to REAL TIME, as -
     The Crowd panics, screaming, and now Edvard is reaching for
     his weapon, as - Sam shoots again, killing the 2nd Gunman,
     and now - The Crowd is still screaming and running as -
     Gregor shoves through the crowd into the exit, as -

     Deirdre pushes through the crowd, and now she's made it into
     the tunnel.  Now we go -

     OUTSIDE THE THEATER -

     Where Larry has heard the shot -- his piece is drawn, but
     he's been ordered to stay in the car.  In frustration he
     slams on the steering wheel, as we see that - Behind Larry,
     the Watcher is slowly closing in, knife poised to strike as
     we go back -

     INTO THE THEATER -

     Edvard tries to get to the exit, but there are too many
     Tourists in his way, and he proceeds to shoot several of
     them, including the Dad we saw earlier.  Seconds later,
     Edvard has vanished into the tunnels, and now - Vincent and
     Sam meet in the middle of the crowd.  There is time for a
     QUICK BEAT, while Vincent glares at Sam.

                          VINCENT
               You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I
               should kill you.

                          SAM
               But you can't.

     And now Sam runs into the tunnel, after the others, leaving
     Vincent for a fraction of a second to sigh, and then follow
     Sam into -

     THE TUNNELS -

     It's like being in the tunnels and ramps of a sporting arena.
     Except that everything here is made of stone and the only
     light comes from the sun which streams in through the exit
     openings which are spaced far enough apart that they provide
     just barely enough light for us to see.  Now we do a SERIES
     OF QUICK CUTS - Sam running, followed by - Vincent, while -
     Edvard takes a wrong turn down a dark hall and comes to a
     dead end.  He turns around, looking for a way out as - Gregor
     sees the final exit ahead of him as we go -

     OUT IN THE STREET - Larry is still behind the wheel of the
     Citroen, anxiously looking at the exit, not realizing that -
     The Watches is almost on him, and now we're back -

     IN THE TUNNELS -

     Deirdre comes running around a corner, and now she's almost
     reached the exit as -

     OUT IN THE STREET -

     Gregor hits the street running.  He doesn't notice the
     Citroen parked ahead, because he's never seen it before, but
     as he runs by -

     The car door swings open and Gregor runs straight into it.
     He smashes into the door and falls to the ground, injured.
     Strong Hands reach out of the car and pull him in.  It's the
     Watcher, and let's give him a name now because he needs one:
     SEAMUS REILLY.  Seated in the front seat is - A very dead
     Larry.  Seamus has cut his throat from ear to ear.

                          SEAMUS
                   (to Gregor, with an Irish
                    accent)
               If you want to live you'll do exactly as
               I tell you.

     THROUGH THE BACK WINDOW - Deirdre appears, exiting the
     theater and running towards the Citroen as we go back to -

     INT. THE TUNNELS - SAME TIME

     Vincent, gun drawn, moves warily down one of the tunnels.
     Outside we can hear the dim sound of an approaching siren.
     Vincent turns a corner and - A GUN jams itself into his face.
     It's Edvard.

                          EDVARD
               Where do I know you from?

                          VINCENT
               Vienna.

                          EDVARD
               Of course...I remember.  I quite liked
               you, I'm sorry to have to do this.

     Edvard's finger tightens around the trigger, when -

                          SAM (O.S.)
               Hey...

     Edvard is startled by the sound of Sam's voice.  Even as he
     squeezes off the shot, Edvard turns to look at Sam, and as he
     does so, Vincent strikes out at the gun, sending the shot
     awry, causing it to - RICOCHET wildly, whining around the
     room, until it - Rips through Sam's side, a nasty wound but
     not fatal, as - Edvard tries to fire another shot but it's
     too late, because - Vincent fires a single shot to the head
     that kills Edvard.

     EXT. OUTSIDE THE THEATER - MEANWHILE

     Deirdre has reached the Citroen.  She looks in and sees
     Seamus and Gregor.  Lastly she looks at the dead Larry.  She
     sighs in disgust, but otherwise doesn't react as if
     surprised.

                          DEIRDRE
               Cold cocking the poor son-of-a-bitch
               would have sufficed, Seamus, don't you
               think?

     SCANT SECOND LATER -

     Larry's body hits the street as the Citroen drives off,
     Deirdre behind the wheel just as - Sam and Vincent run out of
     the theater, with Vincent helping a wounded Sam who bleeds
     from the wound in his side.  They arrive at the street only
     to see - Larry, lying dead in the street, even as the Citroen
     speeds away from them, turning the corner before they can
     even think to raise their guns.

                          VINCENT
               That double-crossing bitch.

     Sam isn't even capable of saying that much -- he just stares
     after the departed Citroen with a look on his face unlike any
     we've seen in the film: "how the hell did that happen?"  But
     there's no time to ponder this because they've been joined by
     - A COP.  He's a local guy, he directs traffic and busts
     drunks in the town square -- and he's scared shitless,
     holding his gun in both hands, trying not to tremble, as he
     stares back at - TWO GUNS, Sam's and Vincent's, and they're
     both pointed at the Cop.  LONG BEAT.  In the way off distance,
     another siren can just be heard.  Sam and Vincent glare at
     the Cop, who strains with all his might to control himself,
     but he can't because Sam and Vincent are death waiting to be
     served.  The cop knows he has three seconds to make up his
     mind.  Two.  One.  The Cop puts his gun on the ground and
     steps back, raising his hands in the air.  Now - Sam and
     Vincent stumble into the street, and are instantly almost hit
     by - A CAR speeding around the corner, its Driver oblivious
     to what's going on.  The car screeches to a halt, and the
     Driver curses loudly in French.  And then the next thing the
     Driver knows - A Gun is in his face.  The door is yanked open
     and the Driver is yanked out, as we -

     CUT TO:

     EXT. A BACK ROAD - LATER/EARLY EVENING

     The town of Orange is just visible below us as the
     commandeered Car drives up into the hills.  Vincent is behind
     the wheel, while the wounded Sam sits in the passenger seat.
     Gritting his teeth, Sam peels back his shirt to get a look at
     - THE WOUND, and it's small but bad -- the ricochet ripped a
     small raw hole in Sam's side.  The wound bleeds, but
     moderately so -- no major organs or arteries have been hit.

                          VINCENT
               That makes twice now you've saved my
               life.

                          SAM
               I didn't save your life back there.
               Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save
               shit.

                          VINCENT
               You see it your way, I'll see it mine.
               You need a doctor.

                          SAM
                   (hopeful)
               You know one around here?  Somebody you
               trust?

                          VINCENT
               No...I thought I'd take you to the
               hospital.

                          SAM
                   (sharply)
               No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I
               have to.

                          VINCENT
                   (he can't believe this)
               Fix it yourself?
                   (a thought comes to him)
               Why are we even doing this?  There's no
               need to run, Christ...
                   (he can't disguise his disgust)
               You're a cop.

                          SAM
               Not exactly.

                          VINCENT
               You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.

                          SAM
               If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have
               busted you a long time ago.  This isn't
               about you, it's about the job I have to
               do.

                          VINCENT
               And what job is that?

                          SAM
               My job, Vincent, a job you don't need to
               know about.  I can't go to the local cops
               -- they'd never be able to get close
               enough at this point.  It's me or nobody,
               and I've been on this job too goddamned
               long not to finish.

     BEAT.  Sam takes out his own pack of cigarettes, offers one
     to Vincent and takes another for himself.  They smoke for a
     second, before Vincent speaks.

                          VINCENT
               It looks to me like we're all that's left
               of our group.

                          SAM
               We?  There is no we in my world now,
               Vincent, just me.

                          VINCENT
               I'm going with you.

                          SAM
               This doesn't involve you, don't you
               understand?  I can't even guarantee you
               any money out of all this.

                          VINCENT
               It isn't about money for me, not
               anymore.

                          SAM
               You don't have to do this.

                          VINCENT
                   (with great finality)
               Yes I do.

     Sam gives Vincent a look and shakes his head in disbelief --
     Vincent's loyalty and sense of honor is something he's never
     seen before, and Sam can only smoke in silence and consider
     this as we -

     CUT TO:

     INT. A CHEAP BACK ROOM - NIGHT

     A PEEPHOLE slides open, and we look through it into -

     INT. AN ADJOINING ROOM

     where Gregor sits, bound and gagged in a chair, his eyes wide
     with fright.  Now - The Peephole snicks shut, and Deirdre
     turns to face Seamus Reilly.

                          DEIRDRE
               When we're done with this, I want to do
               for that one myself.

                          SEAMUS
               Now there's the Deirdre I know.

                          DEIRDRE
               And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus
               Reilly?

                          SEAMUS
               It means I was worried that all the time
               you spent away from the fold might have
               affected you.  You've been living the
               life of the hired gun -- the well paid
               hired gun, I might note.  There's no
               glory to it, but there are those that
               like it.

                          DEIRDRE
               So you thought that maybe I'd grown too
               attached to this charade I've been
               playing, is that it?

                          SEAMUS
               It's been known to happen.

                          DEIRDRE
               Not to me, you know that.

                          SEAMUS
                   (goading her)
               I thought I did.

     Seamus's taunt works: Deirdre whips out her gun and puts it
     to his head.

                          DEIRDRE
               I guess you don't know me, then, if you
               think I won't kill you for an insult like
               that!

     Seamus glares at Deirdre for a moment, and she glares back at
     him until he starts to laugh.

                          SEAMUS
               Just testing, lass.  Forgive me, but I
               had to do it.

     Deirdre glares a moment more and then puts away her gun.

                          DEIRDRE
               Remember what we agreed on, Seamus: when
               we get home, I don't play "the girl"
               again.

     Deirdre gives Seamus a look to make sure this last point is
     clear and we -

     CUT TO:

     EXT. A FARMHOUSE - THE COUNTRY - NIGHT

     The Stolen Car parks behind a BARN, and Sam and Vincent get
     out.  Waiting for them is a friend of Vincent's - JEAN-
     PIERRE, a Frenchman in his forties, hearty, burly, friendly.

                          VINCENT
               Hello, Jean-Pierre.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Hello, my friend.
                   (with a look at Sam)
               He doesn't look French to me, Vincent.

                          SAM
               American.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Well, Vincent's American friend, shall we
               see what we can do for you?

     INT. THE FARMHOUSE KITCHEN - LATER/NIGHT

     SURGICAL IMPLEMENTS - Are laid out on a clean cloth.
     Scalpel, forceps, a clamp, a sponge, medical thread and
     needles.  We PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Sam, stretched out on the
     kitchen table.  Around him we see - Vincent and Jean-Pierre,
     who are wearing rubber gloves and examining Sam's wound.
     Jean-Pierre holds a mirror up so that Sam can see what's
     going on.  Sam, with his medical training, is treating
     himself.

                          VINCENT
                   (to Sam)
               It's right there, beneath the surface.  I
               can just make it out.

     Sam is in terrible pain, but necessity dictates that he focus
     on what's going on so that he can talk Vincent through this
     next procedure.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Are you sure you won't have a drink?

                          SAM
                   (sharply)
               No booze...Pain's in the mind, and the
               mind I can control.
                   (quick beat)
               Alright, let's do it.

     During this next sequence, we CUT BACK AND FORTH between
     Sam's reactions to the surgery, and the mirror itself where
     he's watching.

                          SAM
               Douse the wound with alcohol.

     Vincent pours a healthy splash of rubbing alcohol onto the
     wound and - Sam grits his teeth as the pain explodes up his
     central nervous system.

                          SAM
                   (to Jean-Pierre)
               Take that sponge and wipe away as much of
               the blood as you can, keep it clean so I
               can see.

     Jean-Pierre does as Sam says, wiping away the blood that
     keeps filling the wound.  Throughout the procedure Jean-
     Pierre will do this; every time the sponge is saturated he
     squeezes the excess blood into - A BUCKET which sits on the
     floor, slowly filling up with drippings from the sponge.

                          SAM
                   (to Vincent)
               Take the clamp...

     Vincent picks up the clamp.

                          SAM
               Peel back the skin and attach the clamp.

     Vincent attaches the clamp to Sam's wound.  It takes perhaps
     fifteen seconds, and everyone of those seconds is agonizing
     for Sam.  He sweats, he grits his teeth, he grunts the
     smallest of grunts.  But he doesn't move.  Finally Vincent is
     done.

                          VINCENT
               Alright, it's done.

                          SAM
               You see the bullet?

                          VINCENT
               Clearly.

                          SAM
               Good.  Now take the forceps, and
               remember, Vincent, what we're doing here
               is routine.  I've done stuff like this at
               least twenty times in the field.  There
               are no vital organs where you're working,
               no major muscles or arteries -- you can't
               kill me.  Just make sure you've got the
               bullet before you try to pull it out.

     Vincent probes the wound with the forceps.  This takes
     probably thirty seconds, and it hurts even more then when the
     clamp was attached.

     Several times - Vincent seems to have the bullet in his
     grasp, but it slips, and each time it slips - Sam makes the
     smallest of noises, as if to indicate the level of the pain.
     Finally - The forceps firmly grasp the bullet, and with a
     single tug, Vincent extracts it.

                          VINCENT
                   (holding the bullet aloft)
               A souvenir...

     He tosses the bullet through the air, and we FOLLOW IT IN
     SLOW MOTION as it lands in - A SAUCER, which sits on the
     kitchen counter.  We're back in REAL TIME, as the bullet
     rolls around the plate for a second before coming to a halt.
     Now - Sam breathes the hugest of sighs, and his face relaxes.
     Instantly, Vincent puts a lighted cigarette in Sam's mouth,
     and he drags deeply on it.

                          SAM
                   (to Vincent)
               You think you can stitch me up on you
               own?

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Don't worry, we'll take care of it.

                          SAM
               Then if you don't mind...
                   (he hands the cigarette back to
                    Vincent)
               I'm gonna pass out.

     And that's exactly what he does.

     A TIME CUT TO:

     INT. FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

     Vincent and Jean-Pierre sit on easy chairs.  An open bottle
     of wine sits between them, a FIRE burns in the fireplace, and
     they smoke in a contented silence for a moment.  When they
     speak, it is in FRENCH, with ENGLISH SUBTITLES.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               He's tough, your American friend.

                          VINCENT
               Yes, Sam's tough alright.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               And you respect him.

                          VINCENT
               Of course.  Don't you?

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               I've never seen a man who could have
               taken what he just went through.
                   (beat)
               He's a cop?

                          VINCENT
                   (beat, trying to find a way to
                    say it)
               Not exactly.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?
                   (beat)
               So he saved your life, then?

                          VINCENT
               How did you know?

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               If he hadn't you'd have put a bullet in
               his head a long time ago.

     Both men stare back into the fireplace and we HOLD FOR A BEAT
     before we -

     DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. THE FARM - KITCHEN - DAWN

     Sam is awake.  Pale from the loss of blood, he moves softly
     around the kitchen, searching professionally for something,
     giving the moment a slightly dangerous feel because he seems
     so intent on what he's doing and then he finds it - THE
     COFFEE.

     TEN MINUTES LATER -

     A stream of Hot Coffee migles with a stream of Steamed Milk.

     EXT. THE FARMHOUSE PORCH - SUNRISE

     A STEAMING CUT OF COFFEE sits in Sam's hands as he lights a
     cigarette to go with the coffee.  He sits on an ancient
     chair, smoking in silence, looking out at - THE WOODS around
     the house, and this place is postcard-beautiful, the French
     Farmhouse you see only in pictures.  But Sam's mind is
     elsewhere, he's staring into space, lost in thought.

                          JEAN-PIERRE (O.S.)
               You're feeling better?

     ANOTHER ANGLE - Jean-Pierre stands in the open front door of
     the farmhouse, with a cup of coffee.  Now, Jean-Pierre moves
     out to join Sam, sitting down on another chair opposite him.

                          SAM
                   (responding to the question)
               Some, thanks.  Enough to move on, for
               now.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
                   (pointing at Sam's wounded
                    side)
               You should really let a doctor look at
               that.

                          SAM
               Soon.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               But first you have something to take care
               of?

                          SAM
               Yeah.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Something important?  A thing that cannot
               wait?

                          SAM
               It gets done now or not at all.  Another
               couple of days and the parties concerned are
               gone where I can't get them.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Forgive my intrusion into your affairs,
               but I am the one who connected Vincent to
               this job, his agent, if you will.  He is
               one of my oldest friends and I owe him a
               great debt, much like the debt I suspect
               he owes you.

     A QUICK CUT TO:

     INSIDE THE FARMHOUSE

     Where Vincent has just poured himself a cup of coffee and lit
     a very satisfying cigarette when he hears the voices from
     outside.

                          SAM (O.S.)
               Vincent doesn't owe me a thing.

     Vincent looks up when he hears his name and he moves towards
     the sound of the voices.

                          JEAN-PIERRE (O.S.)
               He sees this differently, as you well
               know.

                          SAM (O.S.)
               I didn't expect that he would.

     BACK ON THE PORCH -

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               You suffered through an agonizing pain
               last night, pain you could have avoided
               by declaring yourself an agent of the
               law.

                          SAM
               Vincent told you that I'm a cop?

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Not a word.  But no ordinary criminal
               would have the extensive military and
               medical expertise you do.  And so I place
               the pieces of the puzzle together in a
               way that makes sense to me.  You work for
               some government agency and you carry a
               gun, and in my world, that makes you a
               cop.

     And now Jean-Pierre produces a LONG BARRELED REVOLVER which
     he places loosely in his lap -- a gesture which seems to say,
     "you'd better explain things to my satifaction or we're
     gonna have a problem."  Sam notices the weapon, but he
     doesn't react overtly.

                          SAM
               So this is what, a test?

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Call it a reckoning of character.

     BEAT.  Sam looks at the Revolver again.

                          SAM
               If I was healthy, I could take that away
               from you.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Perhaps.  But you are not healthy, and if
               you try I'll kill you.

     QUICK CUT TO: Vincent - Who stands inside the house, out of
     sight, but not out of ear shot.  He's listening to
     everything, and we notice that Vincent has taken out his
     own gun.

     BACK ON Jean-Pierre and Sam.  By now Jean-Pierre has raised
     the pistol.  He doesn't point it at Sam, but his finger cocks
     the hammer.

                          SAM
               So what is it you want to know?

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               I suppose I want to know how a man like
               you is created.

                          SAM
               Created?

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like
               steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern
               Samurai.  I've spent my life around
               extraordinary men -- men like Vincent.
               But I've never seen anyone like you.
                   (beat)
               I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes
               with you.

                          SAM
               Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll
               have to carry it for himself.  And I'm
               not any kind of Samurai.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               You seem one to me.

                          SAM
               A Samurai has honor, a Samurai live by
               the code of Bushido, the way of the
               warrior.  I'm just a killer for hire.
                   (beat)
               The world isn't about honor, anymore.
               It's about survival.

     LONG BEAT.  Something in Sam's speech touches Jean-Pierre.
     He relaxes his finger on the hammer.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Survival.  I suppose that's as good a
               cause as any.

     BACK ON Vincent - Who relaxes his grip on his gun. BACK ON
     Sam and Jean-Pierre - And we're PULLING BACK, AWAY from the
     Farmhouse, which glows in the morning sun as we -

     DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. A PARIS STREET - DAY

     A BLACK COMPACT CAR sits in front of a Parisian Post Office.
     Inside the car, behind the wheel, we see Deirdre.  Now,
     coming out of the Post Office, we see - Gregor and Seamus
     Reilly.  Seamus has a coat slung over his arm, hiding the gun
     which he keeps pressed to Gregor's side.  There's no sign of
     the Briefcase as Seamus and Gregor get into -

     INT. THE CAR - SAM TIME

     THUNK!  The door slams shut.  Gregor and Seamus are in the
     back seat.  Almost instantly Seamus angrily snaps a pair of
     handcuffs on Gregor.  Immediately, Deirdre pulls out.

                          DEIRDRE
               Where's the case?

                          GREGOR
                   (nervous)
               There's a problem...

                          SEAMUS
                   (jumping all over him)
               Problem my ass!  I think you're lying to
               me, and if you are you're a dead man!

                          DEIRDRE
               Would somebody tell me what fucking well
               happened in there?

                          SEAMUS
                   (disgusted)
               Nothing.

                          GREGOR
                   (eager to explain)
               The package didn't come.  I'm sure it
               will tomorrow.

     Suddenly Seamus seems to lose it.  He grabs Gregor and slams
     a gun against his head.

                          SEAMUS
                   (he's almost foaming at the
                    mouth)
               If you're lying to me you poor excuse for
               a human being, I'm gonna blow your brains
               all over this car.

                          GREGOR
                   (beyond desperate)
               I swear, it has to come here!  It has
               to...

     BEAT.  For one tension-filled moment, we think Seamus is
     going to splash Gregor's brains all over the place.  But then
     he smiles, puts his weapon away, and pats Gregor gently on
     the face.

                          SEAMUS
               Ease up, man...I'm just checking to make
               sure you're on the level.

     Gregor is beyond speech -- he can only whimper.

                          SEAMUS
               And it seems to me I saw a sign in there
               that says they got a late afternoon
               delivery.  Why don't we come back later
               today and do this all over again, huh?

     Seamus smiles a smile that is more than a little bit
     sadistic.  Neither Gregor nor Deirdre smiles in return as we -

     CUT TO:

     EXT. ANOTHER STREET - PARIS - DAY

     THE EIFFEL TOWER fills our eyes.  And then we PULL BACK TO
     REVEAL that it's a tacky, flyblown poster on a dingy street.
     And now we're -

     MOVING DOWN the Street, until we come to a store whose sign
     advertises in English - HONG KONG MOVIES.  The windows of the
     store are filled with posters.  We MOVE THROUGH TO

     INT. THE STORE - SAME TIME

     TONY SIMON, an expatriate black American, runs this place and
     lives above it.  His shelves are lined with action films made
     in the Far East.  Tony knows everything there is to know
     about the films he sells -- but he also knows quite a bit
     about what's going on in the Parisian Underworld.  he's a
     professional information broker.  Right now he's talking to a
     CUSTOMER in perfect French, with English Subtitles.

                          TONY
               Hey, man, they're both great movies.  One
               is more of a character study, the other
               is more of a straight action thing, but
               they're great movies, and he's an amazing
               fucking filmmaker.

     Tony looks up and sees something that catches his attention.

                          TONY
               Excuse me...

     Vincent and Sam have entered the store.  Sam's ability to be
     back on his feet in such a short time is amazing -- but we
     can see that he's not the same guy he was at the start of the
     film.  what he does from here on in he does by sheer force of
     will.  Now - Tony moves to join them, and the conversation
     immediately turns to English.

                          TONY
                   (to Vincent)
               My man, how you doing?

                          VINCENT
               I'm alright.  And you?

                          TONY
               Doing well.
                   (with a look at Sam)
               This is?

                          VINCENT
               A friend.  I was telling him about how
               you always have the latest tapes.

                          TONY
               Why don't we step into my office...

     Tony's office, it turns out, is the area behind the COUNTER.
     Tony raises a section of the counter that allows him to get
     to the other side, and then he closes it behind him.

                          TONY
               So what can I do for you?

     Vincent checks out the store before he starts speaking.  The
     place is empty except for - The single Customer Tony was just
     talking to.  The Customer is still considering the two films
     Tony was showing him.

                          VINCENT
               I was wondering if you had any movies
               that were particularly new.

                          TONY
               Matter of face there's this flick I've
               been hearing about.  I haven't seen it,
               but from what I hear it's pretty cool.

                          SAM
               What's the story?

                          TONY
               It's an international thing.  Several
               different peoples involved, criminals
               from all over the world, experts brought
               together to do a job.  But maybe the most
               interesting thing about it is that
               preeminent in the plot we find the
               Russian Mob and the IRA in bed together.
               An unlikely group of partners.

                          VINCENT
               Do you have the tape?

                          TONY
               I might know where you could get a copy.

     The Customer approaches the counter.  He has both tapes with
     him.

                          TONY
                   (to Vincent and Sam)
               Let me do some business with my boy here,
               and I'll meet you across the street in
               five.  I gotta make homes here feel like
               he's getting a good deal while I give him
               the pleasure of overpaying me for a
               couple of second generation pirates.

     EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

     The Customer exits, smiling and carrying his tapes -- what a
     great fucking deal he just got!  A few seconds later, Tony
     comes out and locks up the store front.  He crosses the
     street towards -

     INT. A FALAFEL JOINT - A FEW MINUTES AFTER THAT

     A HUGE FALAFEL drips lettuce and tahini sauce from its end.
     We PULL BACK ON - Tony, who's just taken a bite out of the
     falafel.  He sits at a table in the back with Vincent and
     Sam.

                          TONY
                   (his mouth full)
               What I've heard so far, it's all a lot of
               talk.  I wasn't so sure what to make of
               it at first, cause, like I said, the
               Irish and the Russians are an unlikely
               mix.

                          VINCENT
               You said you might know where we can get
               a copy of this tape?

                          TONY
               All depends on whether you want the
               Russian or the Gaelic language version.

                          SAM
                   (instantly)
               Gaelic.

                          TONY
               You sure?

                          SAM
               I'm sure.

                          VINCENT
                   (to Tony)
               Can you get it?

                          TONY
               The Russian would be easier.

                          SAM
               Why's that?

                          TONY
               Cause the Russian production company
               would be easier to find.

                          SAM
               It's the Irish tape we want.

                          TONY
                   (with a sigh)
               Gonna be tough.

     Tony scribbles something on a piece of paper.

                          TONY
               Last I heard there was a film rep for the
               Irish players staying at this address,
               name of Seamus Reilly.

                          SAM
                   (repeating it, he knows this
                    name)
               Seamus Reilly.

                          VINCENT
                   (to Sam)
               You know him?

                          SAM
               I know of him.

                          TONY
               Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish
               Auteur -- a real firebrand.  Thinks his
               more moderate filmmaking brethren have
               turned to making movies for peace-loving
               pussies, if you see what I'm saying.

                          VINCENT
               I get the picture.

     Sam reaches for the piece of paper, but Vincent puts his hand
     on top of it.

                          VINCENT
               Tony and I have to talk some business,
               first.

                          TONY
               I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to
               moan about the price, we settle somewhere
               in the middle.

                          VINCENT
               It's a matter of respect.
                   (to Sam)
               Why don't you wait outside, this won't
               take long.

     Sam smiles slightly and rises from the table, moving towards
     the exit.  Behind him in rapid-fire French, Tony and Vincent
     are now discussing the price of the information.  They are
     both loud and abusive, and obviously they're enjoying
     themselves immensely.

     EXT. THE FALAFEL SHOP - A LITTLE LATER - DAY

     Vincent exits the shop and gets into -

     INT. THE PEUGEOT

     Where Sam sits in the passenger seat as Vincent slides behind
     the wheel.  Vincent tosses Sam a piece of paper.

                          SAM
               The Irish representative?

                          VINCENT
               Yes.

     Vincent gives Sam another piece of paper.

                          SAM
               What's this?

                          VINCENT
               The address of the Russian production
               company.  Just in case we need to find
               them.

                          SAM
               Thorough man.

     Vincent starts the car and we -

     CUT TO:

     EXT. A PARIS STREET - LATER - AFTERNOON

     The Peugeot sits, parked at a cub, a discreet distance from -
     AN APARTMENT HOUSE: 35 Rue de Glacon.  We PUSH IN on the -

     INT. THE PEUGEOT - LATE AFTERNOON

     A PIECE OF PAPER scarwled with the same address: 35 de
     Glacon.  We PULL BACK TO REVEAL -

     Sam, holding this paper and looking out at the apartment
     complex.

                          SAM
               You sure your friend got the right place?

                          VINCENT
               If Tony says this is it, then it's it.

     BEAT.  Vincent wants to know something important.

                          VINCENT
               Tell me, Sam: why do you do this?

                          SAM
               Do what?

                          VINCENT
               Continue when it would be so much easier
               to give it up.

                          SAM
               It's my job.

                          VINCENT
               Then quit.
                   (beat)
               You don't work for Interpol, Sam.

                          SAM
               Sure I do.  You heard him, you heard the
               guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard
               said.

                          VINCENT
               It's a cover, then.  A cover within a
               cover, a feint within a feint.
                   (quick beat)
               You work for the CIA, it's the only
               possible answer.

     LONG BEAT.  Sam considers what to say, and then decides he
     owes Vincent the truth.

                          SAM
               I'm a field agent -- last of an already
               extinct breed.  I do dark ops.

                          VINCENT
               Dark ops?

                          SAM
               Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping.
               Assassination.

                          VINCENT
               Very ugly.

                          SAM
               It is at that.

                          VINCENT
               Not very zen of you, huh?  Not so much
               the modern Samurai after all.

                          SAM
               I never made that claim.

                          VINCENT
               I know.  Jean-Pierre did.

                          SAM
               You were behind the door?

                          VINCENT
               I was waiting to see what would happen.
               I didn't want to kill him if I didn't
               have to.

                          SAM
               You would have done that?

                          VINCENT
               I would have tried not to.  But yes, if
               it would have kept him from shooting you,
               I would have.

                          SAM
                   (almost to himself)
               How could you have done that?

                          VINCENT
               Because I owe you.
                   (he sees something)
               Look at that...

     THEIR POV: Through the Windsheild - Deirdre exits the
     apartment building.

                          SAM (O.S.)
                   (quietly exultant)
               All things come to those who wait.

     Now Deirdre is followed by Seamus and Gregor.

                          VINCENT (O.S.)
                   (really surprised by this)
               He's not dead.

     BACK ON Sam and Vincent.

                          SAM
                   (figuring it out)
               They don't have the package.

                          VINCENT
               You think?

                          SAM
               You said it yourself: Gregor's not dead.
               If they had the package, they'd have
               killed him.

     Vincent and Sam exchange a look -- now they both figure it
     out.

                          VINCENT & SAM
                   (simultaneously)
               They're going to get it.

     CUT TO:

     INT. THE POST OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

     A HAND signs a receipt, and we PULL BACK TO REVEAL Gregor at
     a counter, signing for his package, which slides across the
     counter.  It's the Briefcase, although it's been wrapped in
     BROWN PAPER for its journey through the French Postal System.
     Now we see that - Seamus is still right beside Gregor; is, in
     face, almost on top of him, with a hand in his coat pocket
     which lets us know where his gun is.  Now - The two men start
     to move towards the exit as we -

     CUT TO:

     EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE - A MINUTE LATER/LATE AFTERNOON

     The Black Compact Car idles at a nearby curb, with Deirdre
     behind the wheel.  She's staring so intently at the front of
     the post office, that she's surprised when a SHADOW falls
     across her.  She looks up to see - Sam, standing next to the
     car.  Deirdre starts to reach for her weapon, but Sam cuts
     her off with a word.

                          SAM
               Don't do it...

     Something in his voice conveys enough of a threat that she
     backs off.  Now she and Sam exchange a long look.

                          DEIRDRE
               Well, if it isn't Mr. Interpol himself.
                   (she really sounds betrayed)
               I can't believe I misjudged you like I
               did.

                          SAM
               Oh please..you're on some sort of holy
               mission?

                          DEIRDRE
               I'm a patriate.

                          SAM
               Don't even think that I'm buying that.

                          DEIRDRE
               Where do you get off saying word one?
               All the time pretending to be one of us,
               it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus
               and myself.  And here you are so high and
               mighty, like you're so different from the
               rest of us.

                          SAM
               I didn't say I was.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (she sees something)
               Bloody fucking hell...

     CUT AWAY TO: Gregor and Seamus are leaving the post office.
     By now, Seamus has taken the package away from Gregor.
     Unseen by these two men - Vincent is approaching from the
     side, on an intercept course, his hand inside a bag which he
     carries with him.  Now - Deirdre turns and shoots Sam a look.
     He's still watching her keenly, and we can see that she's
     aching to reach for her piece, but she can't because Sam is
     still on her like a hawk.

                          SAM
               Don't even think it.

     He pulls back the folds of his suit jacket, revealing his
     gun, putting his hand comfortably on the pistol grip.

                          SAM
               I'd kill you before you had it halfway
               out.

     Vincent is closing on Gregor and Seamus, another ten seconds
     and he'll have them.

     Now - Deirdre looks back at Sam, then back at the situation
     developing in front of her, and then suddenly - She slams the
     car into gear and drives off, tires squealing while - Sam
     pulls his piece, sighting down the barrel and - He can't do
     it, can't shoot Deirdre.  Now - The sound of the car alerts
     Seamus, who turns in time to see - Vincent, who is raising
     the bag wrapped around his hand as - The car flies directly
     at - Vincent, who if forced to jump out of the way even as he
     pulls the trigger of the gun hidden within the bag.  The end
     of the bag explodes in a burst of fire, but the shots are off
     the mark - Missing Seamus and Gregor as - Vincent rolls out
     of the way, just in time, while - Deirdre brakes the car to a
     screaming halt, as Seamus pushes Gregor in ahead of him and
     then gets in.  Seconds later, the car pulls out, even as -
     Sam drives up in the Peugeot to Vincent, who picks himself up
     off the ground and leaps into the car.  The last thing we
     hear is the sound of Sam's Voice as the Peugeot drives off.

                          SAM (V.O.)
               Put your seatbelt on.

     CUT TO:

     INT./EXT. - CAR CHASE MONTAGE

     During this SEQUENCE, we'll JUMP CUT BETWEEN the two cars and
     the streets they travel through.  Now - The Black Compact Car
     flies down a small street, followed closely by - The Peugeot,
     where Sam is driving as Vincent tries to steady his gun to
     get a clear shot at the other Car.

     INSIDE THE PEUGEOT -

                          VINCENT
               What the fuck happened?

                          SAM
               I don't know...

                          VINCENT
               You don't know?  Bullshit, you had her,
               there was no way out.

     IN THE COMPACT CAR -

     Where Deirdre is driving for dear life, while Seamus is
     freaking out.

                          SEAMUS
               What in bloody hell is going on?

                          DEIRDRE
               They're part of the team.  One of them's
               the guy I told you about.

                          SEAMUS
               From Interpol?

                          DEIRDRE
               That's him.

     IN THE PEUGEOT -

                          VINCENT
               Why didn't you kill her?

     IN THE COMPACT -

                          SEAMUS
               Why didn't you kill him?

     OUT IN THE STREET -

     The two cars SLAM through the traffic, heading for a HIGHWAY
     RAMP which appears now perhaps two blocks away.

     IN THE PEUGEOT -

                          VINCENT
                   (figuring it out)
               You slept with her!

     IN THE COMPACT -

                          SEAMUS
               How is it these fellahs managed to get
               the drop on us?

                          DEIRDRE
               I told you: they're good...

     OUT IN THE STREET -

     THE TWO CARS have reached the highway ramp, and as first one,
     and then the other pulls onto the highway, we PULL BACK AND
     UP TO REVEAL:

     THE PERIFERIQUE -

     The massive and confusing highway system which encircles the
     city of Paris.  Right away we notice that this entrance ramp
     leads to a traffic circle, filled with various off ramps
     which lead to no less than four different sections of the
     Periferique.

     IN THE PEUGEOT -

                          VINCENT
                   (slamming the dashboard in
                    disgust)
               You slept with her!

     IN THE COMPACT -

                          SEAMUS
                   (lecturing Deridre)
               You should have kill him when you had
               the chance.  But no...

     IN THE PEUGEOT -

                          VINCENT
               You put everything on the line because
               you...

     IN THE COMPACT

                          SEAMUS
                   (as if finishing Vincent's
                    sentence)
               You slept with the fucker!!

     ON THE PERIFERIQUE -

     THE PEUGEOT cruising on an upper part of the traffic circle,
     while down below them - THE COMPACT turns towards one of the
     roadways.

                     VINCENT (O.S.)
          Fuck...

     IN THE PEUGEOT -

                          VINCENT
               Left left left!!!

     Sam looks up and sees - Three possible ramps: one to the
     right, one to the center, and one to the - Left.  At the last
     second he takes the left turn as we go back to -

     IN THE COMPACT CAR -

     Where Seamus has turned from lecturing Deirdre to threatening
     Gregor.  Seamus holds the package in one hand and his gun in
     the other.

                          SEAMUS
                   (waving the package)
               This better be the real thing or you're a
               dead man!

                          GREGOR
               It is, I'm telling you it is!!

                          SEAMUS
               You've told me a lot of things, boyo...

     ZING-SHATTER!  A BULLET blows a hole in their back windshield
     as - The Peugeot is catching up, and Vincent is leaning out
     of his window, firing away.  Now - Seamus turns to Deirdre.

                          SEAMUS
               Lose them!

                          DEIRDRE
               You lose them!

     Deirdre swings the wheel wildly, and the Compact takes a
     screaming turn, followed by - The Peugeot, and now they're
     both speeding towards another junction, where several other
     roadways of the Periferique run together.  Now we see that -
     Seamus is returning Vincent's fire, even as - The Junction
     approaches, and now - Seamus screams at Deirdre.

                          SEAMUS
               To the right!!!

     Deirdre swerves to the right only to discover that she's now
     on an -

     EXIT RAMP, going against heavy traffic.  Now -

     Deirdre swerves her car around, side-swiping several cars,
     but avoiding a major crash while - The Peugeot follows along,
     and now -

     One of the cars that Deirdre side-swiped careens wildly down
     the ramp, crashing into - The Peugeot, which grinds to a halt
     as Vincent and Sam bounce forward in their seats, restrained
     by their seatbelts.  The car has stalled, and Sam has to
     start her up again and slam it into gear before following
     after - The Compact, which now has a lead of perhaps fifty
     yards -- but at least it's possible for the Peugeot to follow
     after the Compact, because it's the only car on the highway
     ahead of them that's GOING THE WRONG WAY, and now we - PULL
     BACK, LOOKING DOWN FROM ABOVE, and the two cars are flying
     through the rush-hour traffic, going the wrong way, and now -
     The Peugeot is gaining ground as Sam turns to Vincent.

                          SAM
               Give me a cigarette.

                          VINCENT
               Right now?

                          SAM
               Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!

                          VINCENT
                   (fumbling with a cigarette)
               Why are you driving?
                   (rapid fire)
               You're not French, you don't live here,
               you don't know these roads.  Why are you
               driving?

     He puts the cigarette in Sam's mouth and as he does - The
     Peugeot weaves in and out of the traffic, gaining ground on
     the Compact, and now - SCREEEEECCHHH!!!!  About fifteen cars
     pile up, crashing into one another, and yet somehow - The
     Compact Car emerges from the pile up unscathed, and Seamus
     breathes a hugh sigh of relief.

                          SEAMUS
               About time!

                          DEIRDRE
                   (glancing in her mirror) 
               Not yet...

     The Peugeot has also managed to avoid the pile-up, and it's
     back on their tail.

                          SEAMUS
                   (practically tearing his hair)
               Good Christ!  Can't you lose these
               jokers?

                          DEIRDRE
                   (through clenched teeth)
               They're good!

     And now the Peugeot SLAMS into the side of the Compact Car,
     and as it does - Seamus opens fire with his gun, even as -
     Vincent unloads the better part of a clip as - Glass shatters
     in both cars, and now Deirdre looks up to see -

     A FORK IN THE ROAD, and the left side of the fork is closed
     off, blocked by - A SERIOUS CONCRETE BARRICADE, and the
     Compact Car is headed right for it, and now -

     Sam has the Peugeot pinned right to the side of the Compact
     Car, metal against metal, a scream of steel as the Barricade
     rushes straight at them and at the last second - Deirdre
     slams on the brakes as -

     Seamus fires one last shot that - blows out the window in
     front of Sam's eyes, causing Sam to - Jerk the wheel of the
     Peugeot wildly, spinning out of control onto the exit ramp as
     Gregor reaches over and unbuckles Seamus's seatbelt right as -
     The Compact Car slams into the Barricade and CRASHES, and
     we're in SLOW MOTION as -

     Deirdre is driven forward by the force of the impact, but
     there's a driver's side air bag, and it explodes, cushioning
     her, even as -

     Seamus is hurled form the car, crashing through the
     windshield and flying through the air as -

     The Compact Car flips over and over and over while -

     Gregor, who is wearing his seatbelt, hangs on for dear life
     to the Briefcase, which he grabbed back from Seamus before
     the crash, and now -

     Seamus hits the ground with a terrible thud, his face
     sliced to ribbons by the windshield, but somehow still alive
     as -

     Sam tries to control the Peugeot, which is in a spin on the
     exit ramp as -

     Gregor kicks open the back door and slides out of the Car,
     carrying the Briefcase with him, as -

     Deirdre struggles to free herself from the wreck, which is
     now - On fire, and now -

     Sam has managed to stop the Peugeot, but it's too late to go
     back, because -

     A VERITABLE FLEET OF COP CARS is now closing on the accident,
     and it's too late to turn around, and even as -

     Deirdre manages to pull herself out of the wreck, it -
     EXPLODES into a ball of fire, and the blast wave of fire -
     Hits Seamus, knocking him down, covering him for a second,
     even as - Deirdre hurls herself through the flames and comes
     out - Rolling away with Seamus, who is now not only cut to
     pieces, but his face is covered with some hideous burns.

     Now Deirdre pulls Seamus over the side of the embankment,
     right before the cops arrive, and the two of them roll/fall
     almost thirty down a steep incline, even as -

     Sam catches a quick glimpse of -

     Gregor, scurrying away from the highway, carrying the
     Briefcase, and now Sam has to gun his car and get gone,
     because the Cops have reached -

     The Wreck, which is quickly burning itself out, and as the
     Cops look into the debris they see that -

     THERE'S NOBODY LEFT.  Everybody's gone.

     FADE OUT.

                          VINCENT (V.O.)
               We don't have much time.

     FADE IN ON:

     INT. VINCENT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     A FRONT DOOR, guarded by about five heavy locks, opens and
     Vincent and Sam enter.  Sam looks around and surveys the
     apartment.

                          SAM
               Nice place.

     ANOTHER ANGLE - And we see the rest of the apartment: there's
     practically nothing here.  A table with a couple of chairs, a
     fridge.  An open door leads to a bedroom with a small, spare
     bed and a nightstand with a cheap lamp.

                          VINCENT
                   (by way of explaining)
               I'm not here very much.

                          SAM
               Business keeps you on the road?

                          VINCENT
               Something like that.

     The two men crass the room towards - A METAL CABINET which is
     tucked into a nook in the wall - VINCENT'S HAND turns a heavy-
     duty COMBINATION LOCK and then: Click, the cabinet opens and
     we see -- WEAPONS.  An endless cache of guns, knives,
     explosives, surveillance devices, gun scopes -- you name it,
     it's here.  Now Vincent's Hands reach into the cabinet and
     start taking out weapons.  We PULL BACK ON -

     Vincent, who gives the weapons to Sam.  Sam checks to make
     sure the weapons are loaded and/or ready for use, and then
     piles them, one on top of the other.

                          SAM
               I know I don't need to say this to you,
               but I need to say it to you.
                   (beat)
               This is my job, I have to do it.

                          VINCENT
               So I do it.

                          SAM
               No you don't, and you know it.

                          VINCENT
               If our positions were reversed, would you
               leave me?

                          SAM
                   (he says this too quickly)
               In a minute.

                          VINCENT
               I think not.

     BEAT.  Sam can't say anything, because he knows that what
     Vincent is saying is true.

                          VINCENT
                   (considering the weapons)
               Do we need anything else?

                          SAM
               Yeah.  We need out fucking heads examined.

     Vincent thinks about this for a seoncd -- and then burst out
     laughing as we -

     CUT TO:

     INT. ANOTHER CAR - MEANWHILE/NIGHT

     Deirdre once behind the wheel.  The passenger seat next to
     her is empty, but as she drives we can see her eyes as they
     flick from the road in front of her, to the rearview mirror,
     which reveals -

     A glimpse of the HIDEOUS FACE of Seamus Reilly.  Crashing
     through the windshield and the blast of fire have forever
     changed the way he looks: his face is now a mass of oozing
     wounds and burn tissue.  In his eyes we see the light of a
     sick, twisted man who's gone over the edge.

                          DEIRDRE
               You better be careful, Seamus, before
               something happens a plastic surgeon can't
               fix.

                          SEAMUS
                   (a hideous laugh)
               Plastic fucking surgeon?
                   (indicates his face)
               You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre
               lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and
               I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those
               who done it to me, I'll take my pound of
               flesh before this is all over.

                          DEIRDRE
               You're thinking with your gun, Seamus,
               and not your head...

                          SEAMUS
                   (losing it)
               Shut up!!!
                   (he puts a gun to her head)
               Shut up and drive!  I'm your superior
               officer and you will do as I goddamn well
               say, is that understood?!?

     BEAT.  Deirdre bristles at Seamus's words but says nothing.

                          SEAMUS
               Do I need to repeat myself?

                          DEIRDRE
               No, Seamus.  I heard you the first time.

     EXT. OUTSIDE THE CAR - SAME TIME

     THE CAR zooms off into the night and as it does -

     A LIGHT RAIN starts to fall and we -

     DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. A CHATEAU OUTSIDE OF PARIS - NIGHT

     THE SAME RAIN falls, more of a steady mist than a rain.  The
     mist GLEAMS electrically in the THOUSAND WATT LIGHTS which
     shine from - THE CHATEAU.  Hundreds of years old, it sits far
     back from its own MAIN GATE.  In front of the Chateau - ARMED
     MEN.  Lots of them.  Whatever this place is, it's not one
     that invites company.  Now we're - MOVING TOWARDS the
     Chateau, and as we MOVE we get a glimpse of the surrounding
     environment: ancient statues, sitting benches in private
     gardens, small pools of fish -- you name it, this place has
     it.  We hear VOICES, and they're talking in - RUSSIAN.
     Heavy, thick Russian, punctuated with words like "Da!" and
     "Nyet!" -- making it clear that we've reached the address of
     the Russian Production Company.  BEHIND THE CHATEAU - MORE
     GARDENS, more everything.  It's well-patrolled, but there
     aren't quite as many guards back here as there are out front,
     because bordering the chateau is a natural fotress -

     A WOODS -

     A forest, really.  Filled with ancient trees, almost mythic
     in appearance, and for all the light of the chateau this
     place is darkness visible -- light comes here and dies.  And
     in this woods, looking out, we find - Vincent and Sam.
     Heavily armed, they've just humped God knows how many miles
     through the woods to get here.  Both men exhausted from the
     walk -- Sam from his wound, Vincent from his smoking habit.
     They collapse and Vincent takes out his cigarettes.  Even
     though they're screened from the chateau back here, Sam
     reaches over and takes the cigarettes out of Vincent's hands.

                          SAM
               Not here.  They might see it.

                          VINCENT
               If I'm going to die for the CIA, I'm
               going to go out smoking.
                   (takes the cigarettes back and
                    lights one)
               Besides, there's half a forest between us
               and them, they can't see a goddamned
               thing.

     Vincent offers one to Sam, who declines with a shake of
     his head.

                          SAM
               Time to quit.

                          VINCENT
               Just like that?

                          SAM
               Not just like that... Just before I turn
               around and it's six months from now and
               the first thing I do when I wake up in
               the morning is light a cigarette.

                          VINCENT
                   (obviously he does this)
               What of it?
                   (almost to himself)
               Samurai pain in the ass.

                          SAM
                   (he hates this)
               Would you stop with that...

                          VINCENT
               Why?  You've got more force of will than
               anyone I've ever seen.  You handle a gun
               like it's a part of you, you perform
               surgery on yourself without anesthesia...
                   (quick beat)
               And most amazing of all, you quit
               smoking, just like that.

                          SAM
                   (qith a cynical laugh)
               The mark of a true Samurai.
                   (seriously)
               What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no
               different than what you do.  We're both
               hired guns, and this is a job -- like any
               other job.

                          VINCENT
               Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is
               a job like any other?  Surely, if you are
               a hired gun, you realize that some times
               you just have to walk away without
               getting what you came for.

                          SAM
               Because I don't walk away.

                          VINCENT
               Why not?

                          SAM
               It's the one thing I've got left to hold
               onto.
                   (beat)
               Jean-Pierre is one of your closest
               friends, is he not?

                          VINCENT
               Closest and oldest.

                          SAM
               And yet you would have killed him to save
               my life.
                   (quick beat)
               You have a sense of honor, Vincent, that
               I can't even remember anymore.  I don't
               know that I ever even had it to begin
               with.  All I know to do, Vincent, is to
               finish my job.

                          VINCENT
               And when you finish?  What then?  This
               package, whatever it is, do you give it
               to the CIA?  Do you really think they
               deserve it?

                          SAM
               That's a good question.

                          VINCENT
               Do you have a good answer?

                          SAM
                   (he's really just considering
                    this)
               No, I don't.

     INT. THE CHATEAU - MEANWHILE

     ARMED RUSSIAN MOBSTERS everywhere -- a convention of the goon
     squad.

     MOVING THROUGH the Chateau itself, and from in here we see
     the side of France we haven't yet seen in this film: culture.
     Each room could be a museum, as we move through -

     A GALLERY, filled with paintings by Renaissance Masters -

     A PARLOR, with antique furniture, the youngest piece of which
     is two hundred years old -

     A BALLROOM, empty and barren, but lit by the dazzling light
     of an exquisite chandelier -

     A KITCHEN, where a cigarette smoking CHEF is putting the
     finishing touches on what is perhaps the most amazing meal
     you've ever seen.  Now - A SERVANT takes the tray and carries
     it out to -

     A DINING ROOM, and the table is set for a formal dinner for
     twenty, with crystal and china at every place setting, and
     yet the table is occupied by only one man -

     MIKHAEL RACHEV, Russian Gangster Supreme, called Mikhi.  Now -

     The Servant sets the food down in front of Mikhi, and as this
     chief hood starts to eat a lonely and solitary dinner we PULL
     BACK, MOVING DOWN the length of the way-too-long table.

     EXT. THE CHATEAU WALLS - NIGHT

     A TAXI pulls up to the Main Gate and Gregor gets out.
     Attached to his wrist, by that same handcuff: the Briefcase.
     Gregor is admitted by a Guard as we -

     CUT TO:

     INT. THE DINING ROOM/CHATEAU - A LITTLE LATER

     Mikhi the Gangster is eating his dinner as Gregor is ushered
     into the room.  THREE THUGS hang back behind Gregor, watching
     to see what Mikhi wants.  Now -

     Mikhi waves the Thugs out of the room, leaving Gregor alone
     with the gangster.  Mikhi takes a last few bites of dinner as
     he motions for Gregor to sit.

                          MIKHI
                   (in Russian, English subtitles)
               Sit, sit...
                   (offering a cigarette)
               Would you like one?

                          GREGOR
                   (in English)
               No, Mikhi, I wouldn't.
                   (letting that sink in for a
                    minute)
               Since I won't speak your language, and
               you can't speak mine, English will do
               nicely.

                          MIKHI
                   (makes no never mind to him)
               Whatever you wish...
                   (lights his own cigarette)
               This has all been a terrible mistake,
               Gregor.  I wanted to play straight with
               you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill
               you.

                          GREGOR
               Edvard said the same thing about you
               before he died.

                          MIKHI
               I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd
               believe him.

                          GREGOR
                   (suddenly sharp)
               Enough!

     Gregor raises the Briefcase which is still attached to his
     wrist via the handcuff.  Gregor rests the Briefcase on the
     table.

                          MIKHI
               Ahh...

     The moment of truth.  Before this scene can develop any
     further, a VOICE comes from Off Screen, and as the Voice
     speaks, Gregor blanches.

                          SEAMUS (O.S.)
               The moment of truth, is it?

     ANOTHER ANGLE - Deirdre and Seamus have entered the room.
     And we notice something unusual: nobody is alarmed (except
     for Gregor, that is).  It's as if they were expected.

                          GREGOR
               What is he doing here?

     As Seamus speaks he walks through the room, examining the
     valuable china and crystal, all the while moving inexorably
     closer to Gregor.  His face is, if anything, even more
     horrific than it was a short while ago, as his formerly fresh
     wounds have started to scab over.

                          SEAMUS
               What am I doing here?  Why, I'm here to
               see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the
               Russian Mafia.  See, your bosses had
               hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull
               your thieving double cross.  But they
               only just found out that what's in the
               briefcase is completely useless without
               me.  I can't fight them, and they can't
               kill me -- that means we're gonna have to
               do business together.

                          GREGOR
               But you hate each other!

                          SEAMUS
               What's a little hate between business
               partners?

     EXT. THE WOODS - MEANWHILE

     Vincent's CIGARETTE is stubbed into a rock and the two men
     rise with a slow purpose.  They exchange a look and then Sam
     steps forward, leading the way

                          SAM
               I'm on point, Vincent.

     A WIDE ANGLE - THE BACK LAWN OF THE CHATEAU -

     Pure Kurosawa.  The JAPANESE DRUM we've heard before starts
     to play again as -

     THE LONG SHADOWS of Sam and Vincent come out of the woods and
     into the brilliant light of the back lawn.  For one minute
     they stand still, and among the many weapons that Sam carries
     is a long automatic rifle, strung over his back, and in the
     SILHOUETTE for one minute it looks like a Samurai sword.  Now
     the two men start to move across the lawn, hugging the
     shadows of the various statues and hedges, trying to keep
     from being discovered for as long as possible.

     BACK IN THE DINING ROOM -

                          GREGOR
                   (to Seamus)
               So, you've got it all figured, do you?

                          SEAMUS
               Figured enough to know there's an odd man
               out and I'm looking at him.

                          GREGOR
               I think not.
                   (holds up the Briefcase)
               I have, of course, taken the precaution
               of wiring the briefcase to explode five
               seconds after it opens.  Unless, of
               course, I deactivate it before it goes
               off.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (under her breath)
               That fucking figures...

                          GREGOR
               Should any of you decide to rush me, I'll
               kill myself and whoever happens to be
               near me at the time.

                          MIKHI
               And more importantly --

                          GREGOR
               I'll destroy whatever's in the case.

     BEAT.  Nobody moves.  Nobody speaks.  Until finally -

                          SEAMUS
               It looks, Gentlemen, as if we're gonna
               have to sit down to table and work out an
               agreement.

     Before this entirely too-weird scenario can play itself we go
     back to -

     THE BACK LAWN OF THE CHATEAU -

     Sam and Vincent are closer to the Chateau, moving in stealth,
     avoiding any entanglements and then Sam turns a corner and
     comes face to face with - A GUARD, and his gun is aimed at
     Sam's head: Sam's a dead man as we go -

     BACK TO THE DINING ROOM

     AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRE splits the night, and everyone in the
     room looks at one another, before Mikhi speaks.

                          MIKHI
               What was that?

     BACK OUTSIDE THE CHATEAU -

     The Guard who had Sam in his sights falls down, dead, shot by
     - Vincent, whose smoking weapon is cradled in his arms.
     Vincent smiles at Sam.

                          VINCENT
               That's one less I owe you...

     Sam smiles, but it's no time to get satisfied.  their
     presence revealed, there's no point in moving quietly.  Sam
     draws his weapons and as he and Vincent charge across the
     lawn towards the Chateau while -

     BACK IN THE DINING ROOM -

     MORE GUNSHOTS from outside -- not a war, but enough to cause
     serious alarm.  Deirdre, ever the soldier, draws her two
     automatic pistols.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (to Seamus and Mikhi)
               You two stay here and watch our mutual
               interest.

     She nods at Gregor and his Briefcase, indicating what this
     mutual interest is.  Then she turns and bolts the room, and
     as she does we're -

     BACK OUTSIDE THE CHATEAU -

     Sam and Vincent are running along, hugging the ground and
     whatever darkness they can find, while blind weapons fire
     rips into the ground around them, Russian thugs not even sure
     what they're shooting at, but shooting all the same as Sam
     and Vincent hurtle towards -

     A BACK ENTRANCE TO THE CHATEAU -

     Some kind of kitchen storage area, and as Sam and Vincent
     burst in from outside - FIVE RUSSIAN HOODS come flying in
     from an interior entrance, and this is it, Sam and Vincent
     are outnumbered, outgunned, they're going to die and then -
     They take out the entire room - Sam holds an automatic pistol
     in his left hand, and a submachine gun in his right, and when
     he fires, he does so in short controlled bursts, firing only
     when he has the target in his sights, while - Vincent fights
     with a kind of sheer force, a shotgun in one hand, an Uzi in
     the other, he fires at anything and everything that moves,
     and he hits almost all of it - And suddenly the room is
     quiet.  Everybody's dead except for Sam and Vincent.  They
     drop their spent weapons and take out fresh ones even as they
     move towards - THE DOOR - It leads to two passages, each one
     leading to a separate wing of the chateau.

                          SAM
               Let's work our way through the building.
               I'll take one wing, you take the other.

     Vincent and Sam split up, moving into separate WINGS of the
     Chateau, and as they move off Sam speaks a word of warning.

                          SAM
               Watch your back, Vincent.

     And then they're gone, and we're with -

     Deirdre, who's running through the house, going from room to
     room, and we're with her for a minute, the JAPANESE DRUM
     starts to play again, and now it's joined by more and more
     drums, and they continue for the test of this sequence and
     suddenly - A HUGE BURST OF GUNFIRE is heard, dragging
     Deirdre's attention towards -

     THE BALLROOM -

     And Sam's in the middle of a pitched battle with three
     Gunmen.  He kills the first, and then the second, and then -
     No third.  The Third Gunman rolls out of the way as Sam
     fires, the Third Gunman fires back and - Their shots go wide,
     ripping into mirrors and chandeliers, littering the floor
     with glass.  And now we're -

     ON DEIRDRE -

     Running through the halls as we hear one last burst of
     gunfire: somebody in the ballroom is dead.  Deirdre has
     almost reached the ballroom when - Sam comes flying out, and
     the two of them CRASH TOGETHER, sending the two of them
     sprawling into - The shot-up mess that used to be the
     Ballroom - And as they crash to the ground, Sam loses his
     weapon in the fall, but Deirdre manages to hold onto one of
     her two guns.  Now the two of them roll to their feet, and as
     they do we're back in -

     THE DINING ROOM -

     Seamus the Madman is pacing the floor, his face even worse
     than before: with each minute the mask of flesh that is now
     his face is becoming more grotesque.  Little pustules have
     started to form all over its surface, oozing a whitish
     viscous liquid.  A NEW BURST OF FIGHTING SOUNDS can be heard,
     and Seamus, who is no longer capable of thinking straight,
     loses it.

                          SEAMUS
               I can't take it anymore.
                   (to Mikhi)
               Watch him, man, I'm going out and finish
               what needs finishing!

     And Seamus is gone, and so are we -- back to -

     THE BALLROOM -

     Where Deirdre has her two guns pointed at Sam and - Does nothing.
     BEAT.

                          SAM
               Go on, them...

     But Deirdre can't do it.  There's something between these
     two, and now - Sam looks around and sees Deirdre's other
     pistol lying on a broken chair, and now he -

     Kicks out with his foot and hits the chair leg, causing it to
     function as a lever, sending the gun - THROUGH THE AIR in a
     graceful SLOW-MO arc until it - THWACKS into Sam's Hand.  Now
     he's armed and he looks back at - Deirdre.  Her FINGER
     tightens on the trigger, she's almost ready to shoot -- if
     Sam raises his piece, he's a dead man.

                          DEIRDRE
               Let it go, Sam, walk away.

     In response Sam stares at Deirdre for a BEAT and then he
     smiles an enigmatic smile and - He steps sideways, into a
     nearby corridor, vanishing.

                          DEIRDRE
               God damn it!

     She runs after him but she's too late -- The corridor outside
     is empty.  Now we're back in -

     THE DINING ROOM -

     With Gregor and Mikhi, and the tension is unbearable, because
     they can hear the sounds of the fighting as it starts and
     then stops, but they don't have the least idea of what's
     going on.  Still, Mikhi won't let Gregor leave without giving
     up the Briefcase.  Mikhi has a gun on Gregor, who in turn
     holds the Briefcase close, ready to open it and set off the 5
     Second Timer that will blow it up.

                          GREGOR
                   (a feral hiss)
               We'll die if we stay here!

                          MIKHI
                   (threatening with the gun)
               You'll die if you leave here.

     Gregor sits back down, fairly close to Mikhi.  Then, in a
     manner so deft that Mikhi never even notices, Gregor extracts
     a wickedly thin stiletto blade from the leather lining of the
     Briefcase.  Before Mikhi can even react, Gregor stabs his arm
     forward in a savage arc - JAMMING THE BLADE into Mikhi's
     throat.  Mikhi drops his gun and reaches for the blade,
     already gagging on the blood spray which shoots from the
     slashed artery.  Within seconds - Mikhi falls to the ground,
     jerking viciously in his death throes as - Gregor picks up
     the pistol and runs to leave the room, and as he does we move
     to - 

     THE GALLERY -

     Filled with Paintings and Sculptures, nothing less than 200
     years old.  This place is a maze, what with it's walls of
     paintings that jut out here and there, the various corridors
     which lead from room to room, and the sculptures which block
     sight lines.  Now we find - Vincent, pressed against a wall, a
     gun in each hand, while - FIVE RUSSIAN MAFIA GUYS are hunting
     him down.  We do a SERIES OF QUICK CUTS as the Five Guys split
     up and look for Vincent, all the while speaking in low Russian
     voices.  Suddenly one of the Guys turns a corner and sees -
     Nothing.  No Vincent.  Now he turns back and - A FIST CRASHES
     through a painting which hangs on a makeshift wall.  It's
     Vincent.  His hand wraps around Mafia Guy's neck, pinning him
     in place.  Seconds later - Two quick shots rip through the
     painting, hitting Mafia Guy in the head.  Now - The other men
     are alerted by the shots, they come running and - Vincent steps
     out firing -

     And now it's a bullet-fest, as he gets the drop on them,
     using the maze of the Gallery to his fullest advantage,
     gunning them down - First one - Then two - Three, and then -
     No four.  Vincent turns, surprised that his man wasn't where
     he expected him to be when - A SHOT RINGS OUT, hitting
     Vincent, a flesh wound that disarms him.  The Last Guy has
     the drop on Vincent.  Now - The Last Guy smiles a nasty
     little smile at Vincent and - A PISTOL spits fire and - A
     BULLET bursts out of the Last Guy's chest.  It's Sam.  Now
     Sam and Vincent exchange a look: Sam has, once again, saved
     Vincent's life.

                          VINCENT
               You have to stop doing that!

                          SAM
               I'll work on it...

     The two men don't have time for any more words, they move
     from the Gallery and find themselves in -

     THE DINING ROOM -

     Where they find nothing but the bloody remains of Mikhi the
     Gangster.  Sam and Vincent are surveying the room when a
     VOICE comes from BEHIND them -

                          SEAMUS (O.S.)
               Turn around real slow, and try hard not
               to breathe when you do it.

     ANOTHER ANGLE - Seamus Reilly has come in behind them, and
     he's got his gun pointed straight at Sam's heart.  If Seamus
     is enraged at discovering Gregor's absence, he's overjoyed to
     find Sam in his place.

                          SEAMUS
               It's you...
                   (touches his face)
               You're the one did this to my face, are
               you?

                          SAM
               That's me.

                          SEAMUS
               Have a nice afterlife.

     Seamus pulls the trigger and his BULLET spins out towards
     Sam, ready to blow a hole through him except that - Vincent
     leaps forward and takes the bullet -- it rips into his side,
     a huge splash of red against his white shirt.  He falls to
     the ground, horribly wounded, but he's given Sam enough time,
     and now - Sam and Seamus open fire on one another - BULLETS
     RIPPING into the table, chewing up the china and crystal,
     taking glass shattering bites out of the CHANDELIER above the
     table, turning the Dining Room from a primo Louis XIV
     showpiece into shit as the two men move about and then
     suddenly - They're face to face, each with a gun to the other
     - Mexican Standoff.  Suddenly, from Off Screen -

                          DEIRDRE (O.S.)
               Seamus!

     ANOTHER ANGLE - Deirdre has appeared, her gun leveled at the
     two men.

                          SEAMUS
               Deirdre, do for him, woman, put a fucking
               bullet in his head!

     Deirdre hesitates, uncertain.

                          SEAMUS
               Do it, for Christ's sake, do it so we can
               find that stinking Gregor, he's got the
               bloody package!  For God's sake, you're a
               soldier...

     These last words sink into Deirdre: she is a soldier.  Her
     gun swivels towards Sam.

                          SEAMUS
                   (sensing he's getting to
                    her)
               You're one of us...You been born and bred
               with your own people, you can't go
               against your nature.  C'mon, girl, I'm
               you're people.

     Deirdre makes up her mind.

                          DEIRDRE
               I'm no girl, Seamus...

     She fires a shot - Blowing Seamus off his feet and through a
     huge PLATE GLASS WINDOW.

                          DEIRDRE
               And you ain't nobody's people.

     She moves with Sam to Vincent, who is seriously wounded --
     perhaps life-threateningly so.

                          SAM
                   (to Deirdre)
               Let's get him out of here...

                          VINCENT
               Finish the job...

                          SAM
               And now...

                          VINCENT
                   (a commanding whisper)
               Finish it!

     Sam considers, but before he can make up his mind, Deirdre
     sees something through the wreck of the Dining Room Window -

     OUT ON THE BACK LAWN - We've already seen that it's bordered
     on one side by the woods, for the first time we notice - A
     LAKE, which laps against a PRIVATE DOCK, where a row boat is
     tethered.  Now - BENEATH A VERY FULL MOON, the stark figure
     of Gregor makes its way toward the Dock.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (calling out)
               Sam...

     Sam turns at the sound of her voice and sees Gregor making
     his escape.  Sam looks back at Vincent, who is almost passed
     out from blood loss.

                          VINCENT
               I'm really sick of you saving my life.  Go
               out and get the bastard.

     Same makes up his mind, and as Vincent passes out, Sam runs
     out after Deirdre and towards -

     THE PRIVATE DOCK -

     And as the two of them run we MOVE WITH THEM.

                          DEIRDRE
               He's got the briefcase rigged to explode
               five seconds after anybody other than
               himself tries to open it.

     And now they reach the Dock and they find - Nothing -- no
     Gregor.  And the Boat is still there.  Before Sam can
     restrain her - Deirdre stps out towards the Boat.

                          SAM
               Deirdre, wait up --

     But it's too late: Gregor steps out from behind -

     A BOATHOUSE, and before Deirdre can even figure out what
     happened, Gregor has her in an arm lock, a gun to her head.
     His free hand sticks out and we see the Briefcase, which is
     still handcuffed to his wrist.

                          GREGOR
               You might have made a good field agent
               you arrogant American prick, but you're
               not smart enough to go up against me.

     Gregor and Deirdre are poised at the edge of the lake.  This
     Private Dock is made completely of stone, and the drop to the
     water is nearly five feet.  Sam has reached a position where
     there is no right answer.  Still, he points his gun at
     Gregor, who in turn shields himself with Deirdre's body.

                          GREGOR
               Go ahead, shoot... Shoot and kill the
               bitch, I don't care.
                   (beat)
               And yet you don't shoot.  Interesting.
               Put down your weapon and walk away.

                          DEIRDRE
               Don't do it, Sam!

                          GREGOR
               Shut up!

                          DEIRDRE
               He'll kill me anway, Sam, shoot though
               me and kill this fucker.

                          SEAMUS (O.S.)
                   (a horrible croak)
               If you don't, I will...

     ANOTHER ANGLE - Seamus is somehow still barely alive -- he's
     not long for this world, but the will for revenge has driven
     him this far.

                          SEAMUS
                   (to Sam, in a cold pale rage)
               Shoot that traitorous bitch and I'll let
               you live.

     THE TOP OF SEAMUS'S HEAD explodes, finishing him off once and
     for all, killed by -

     Vincent, who has staggered out to make this one necessary
     shot.  But he can go no further, and he collapses in his own
     blood, near death, just as - Gregor takes a step towards the
     boat and - Sam makes up his mind and shoots - THE BULLET
     FLIES ACROSS THE SCREEN -

     IMPACT - The Briefcase bursts, shot open by Sam and now we're
     in SLOW MOTION as -

     Gregor relaxes his grip on Deirdre as he struggles to close
     the case and - Deirdre takes the opportunity to dive the
     other, into the lake, while -

     BABOOM!  The case EXPLODES, a flash of phosphorescent white
     light that incinerates Gregor and the case and whatever was
     inside it with an explosion that knocks Sam to the ground and
     when the light clears - Gregor and the case are gone, while -
     THE EXPLOSION ECHOES out over the lake, booming again and
     again until finally there is - SILENCE.  Sam looks out over
     the lake for any sign of Deirdre - But there is none.  And
     then, after we've held for a BEAT longer than it should be
     possible for her to have survived - her head splits the
     surface and she emerges, coughing.  Sam reaches down to help
     her out.

                          SAM
               Are you alright?

                          DEIRDRE
               Alright?  It's bloody fucking freezing in
               here!

     Sam pulls Deirdre out of the water and then the two of them
     immediately turn and move towards Vincent, and as they do we
     start to PULL BACK on them, and now the SOUNDS of SIRENS can
     be heard, one, then two more, and then a symphony of noise.
     And we're STILL PULLING BACK ON -

     THE CHATEAU - Or what's left of it, because it's started to
     burn, and quickly the flames start to rise into the night,
     like something out of medieval times as we -

     DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. A HOSPITAL WAITING AREA - NIGHT

     Sam waits outside a hospital room, inside of which we get a
     glimpse of - A DOCTOR tending to a heavily bandaged and
     sedated Vincent.  As Sam waits - TWO GENDARMES and a
     PLAINCLOTHES DETECTIVE approach.  The Detective looks at Sam
     for a BEAT, and then goes to push past him.  Sam blocks his
     way.

                          DETECTIVE
               I need to speak with that man.

                          SAM
               I'm sorry, I can't allow that.

     Sam reaches into his coat, and for a moment everybody thinks
     he's going for his gun, but instead he comes out with - A
     PIECE OF PAPER.  He hands it to the Detective.

                          SAM
               Call that number and ask them what you
               should do.

     The Detective eyeballs the number suspiciously.

     FIVE MINUTES LATER -

     The Detective hangs up a nearby wall phone and then looks
     over at Sam in disgust.  Without another word, the Detective
     signals to the two Gendarmes, and all three men exit.  Now -

     The DOCTOR, a beautiful French Woman, comes up and speaks to
     him in FRENCH -- and the amazing thing is that Sam speaks
     back.  Everything in SUBTITLED.

                          DOCTOR
               You can see your friend, now.

                          SAM
               Thank you very much.

                          DOCTOR
               The field dressing you put on saved his
               life.
                   (giving him a look)
               Where di you learn to do that?

                          SAM
               Here and there, I guess.

     The Doctor isn't entirely satisfied with this answer, but
     it's the only one she's going to get, because Sam moves past
     into -

     INT. VINCENT'S ROOM

     He's barely alive -- but alive nonetheless.  And he's heard
     Sam speak in French to the Doctor.

                          VINCENT
               You son-of-a-bitch...

                          SAM
               What?

                          VINCENT
               You speak French.

                          SAM
               What of it?

                          VINCENT
                   (in mock exasperation)
               Nothing...

     He lies back on his pillow, pissed and yet amused.

                          VINCENT
                   (repeating the Doctor's words
                    in English)
               "Your field dressing saved his life."
               That's three I owe you.

                          SAM
               You don't owe me a goddamned thing,
               Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in
               front of a bullet for me.
                   (very seriously, he now
                    believes this)
               I owe you a heavy debt.

                          VINCENT
                   (relishing this)
               I know.

                          SAM
                   (rising to leave)
               You better get some sleep, alright?

                          VINCENT
               Tell me something first.
                   (a quick beat)
               The package: what was it?

                          SAM
               I don't know.  Nobody knows, except a
               bunch of people who are too dead to tell
               us.  There's probably a couple of guys
               back at the Company who know, but I don't
               think they plan to tell me anytime soon.

                          VINCENT
               What happened to it?
     
                          SAM
               Gone.  Destroyed.

                          VINCENT
                   (sighs, then a beat)
               I guess that's for the best.

     Sam turns for the door but Vincent has one last thing to say.

                          VINCENT
               Sam, when Gregor had Deirdre by the lake,
               you could have killed the two of them
               with one shot.  You could have had the
               package, finished the job.  But you
               didn't, you sacrificed the job to save
               her life.  Why?

     Same has to think about this for a second, and his answer
     reveals just how full circle he's come.

                          SAM
               It's what you would have done.

     And on that note Sam exits the room, leaving a bemused
     Vincent behind.

     EXT. THE BANK OF THE RIVER SEINE - EARLY MORNING

     A WISPY FOG atmospherically rises off the river -- not too
     thick, not too thin.

     A TITLE: One month later...

     We're MOVING along the cobble-stone walk next to the river as
     a VOICE cuts through the fog.

                          VINCENT (V.O.)
               Would you just smoke already...

     A RIVERSIDE CAFE - Where Sam, Vincent and Deirdre are having
     morning coffee.  A mostly-healed Vincent is smoking a
     cigarette, trying to get Sam to light up.

                          SAM
               I told you, I quit.

                          VINCENT
               Just to keep me company, Sam -- I hate
               smoking alone.
                   (turning to Deirdre)
               How about you?  I thought all you IRA
               types smoked.

                          DEIRDRE
               Only the stupid ones.  Cigarettes kill
               more patriots than bullets.
                   (a quick beat)
               Besides, I'm not IRA no more.

                          VINCENT
               So where do you go from here?

                          DEIRDRE
               I don't know.  I was thinking...Maybe the
               three of us might partner up -- guns for
               hire, that sort of thing.

                          VINCENT
               I'm up for that...

     The two of them turn to Sam, but he shakes his head.

                          SAM
               Not me.  You work too often with the same
               people and you become friends -- clouds
               your judgement.

                          DEIRDRE
               Come off it, Sam -- if we weren't friends
               already we wouldn't be here now, would
               we?

                          VINCENT
               She's got a point.
                   (playing a trump card)
               Besides, I know of a job that's
               available.

     Sam can't help it -- he's interested.

                          SAM
               How much does it pay?

     SLAM CUT TO:

     EXT. OUT ON THE RIVER SEINE - MEANWHILE

     SILENCE AND FOG.  A RIVER FERRY does a slow ghostly glide
     down the river, and in seconds it approaches -

     THE RIVERSIDE CAFE, which appears through the mist, looked at
     by --

     A SLEEK PAIR OF SUN GLASSES attached to a young PUNK in a
     leather coat, and the Punk is looking at - Sam, Vincent, and
     especially: Deirdre.  Sam looks up and shouts a warning as -
     The Punk pulls a shotgun from beneath his leather coat, pumps
     the gun and screams out at Deirdre with an Irish accent -

                          PUNK
               This is for Seamus!

     BOOM!  The Punk pulls the trigger, a blast of fire as - Sam's
     gun is already out, TWO QUICK SHOTS squeezed off and - The
     Punk is capped twice in the head, dead, sailing away on the
     Ferry which never stops as -

     THE CAFE goes wild, CUSTOMERS running, screaming, WAITERS
     dropping their trays.  But - Sam doesn't run, and neither
     does Vincent.  Sam stands, stunned by what he sees - Deirdre
     lies on the ground, hit full on in the chest: she's dead.  A
     BEAT OF PURE SILENCE - Broken by SIRENS in the distance, but
     quickly growing closer.  Now - Vincent looks at Deirdre's
     corpse, then at Sam, who is unable to move.  For maybe the
     first time in his professional career, Sam is staggered by
     the loss of a life.  Vincent gently takes Sam's arm.

                          VINCENT
                   (soft yet urgent)
               We have to go, Sam, we can't be here.

     Sam looks at Vincent, and for a moment Sam struggles to find
     something to say, but he can't find a goddamned thing.  The
     SIRENS are getting louder -

                          VINCENT
                   (a little louder, bordering
                    desperation)
               Let's go!!

     Vincent literally drags Sam away and now the SIRENS have
     arrived, followed quickly by - THE GENDARMES, who come
     running into the Cafe but - It's empty except for Deirdre's
     body.  Now -

     THE STREET ABOVE THE RIVER -

     Sam and Vincent are running through patchy fog, Vincent
     leading the way, and now -

     We're CLOSER ON Vincent as he runs and runs and runs until he
     feels he's far enough away from the scene of the crime to
     relax.  He collapses against a stone wall, chest heaving,
     shaking out two cigarettes, one for himself and one for Sam.

                          VINCENT
                   (thrusting the cigarettes out to
                    Sam)
               Doctor's orders...

     But Sam isn't there to take the cigarette -- Vincent looks
     around, trying to see what happened to his friend, but the
     fog has covered any sign of Sam.  Vincent stands there,
     stunned, alone, the cigarettes in an outstretched hand that
     slowly falls back to Vincent's side as he realizes that Sam
     has left him on purpose.  Then - Vincent lights both
     cigarettes at the saem time and throws one of them over the
     stone wall - THE GLOWING CIGARETTE arcs through the air until
     it lands in the river where it extinguishes with a hiss.

                          VINCENT (O.S.)
               Goodbye, Sam...

     BACK AT THE CAFE -

     The Gendarmes have secured the scene (there isn't much to
     secure since everyone has run away).  A majority of cops
     surround Deirdre's dead body, but - One GENDARME wanders
     around the cafe, looking about, and then he sees something -

     ON THE STREET ABOVE -

     A SHAPE IN THE FOG.  The wind blows and the fog clears for a
     second, and we see that it's - Sam.  Getting one last look at
     Deirdre.  Quickly - The Gendarme points Sam out but as he
     does the wind continues to blow and - THE FOG swallows Sam.
     Seconds later the fog clears again, and when it does - Sam is
     gone.

     FADE OUT.
Rush Hour

			Original Screenplay

FADE IN:

EXT.  LOS ANGELES - DAY

The whole dysfunctional megalopolis, beige and blurry in the
summer smog. If this is the American Dream, do me a favor and
wake me up.

EXT.  LAX - DAY

The traffic loop outside the terminals is gridlocked -- mostly
with stretch limousines.

INT.  LAX - (INCLUDE NEWS REPORT MONTAGE) - DAY

Inside, the airport is done up with festive posters, streamers
and banners: Welcome - Pacific Partners Summit

A planeload of cheerful CHINESE DELEGATES come into the
crowded terminal. Some sport red T-shirts with a picture of
Mao wearing Mickey Mouse ears.

They get onto the people mover, passing by a TV REPORTER:

				REPORTER
			(to TV CAMERA)
		Eager to mend its tarnished image,
		Los Angeles has really put out the
		welcome mat for tomorrow's summit.
		The city promises quite a party as
		leaders from Japan, China, South
		Korea, Australia, the U.S. and
		others begin talks for the largest
		free-trade treaty in history.

The SCENE changes to TAPE of DELEGATES from other countries
arriving.

Then, we see massive SECURITY PREPARATIONS all around the city.

				REPORTER (VO)
			(continuing)
		The one sour note is North Korea,
		the only Pacific Rim country not
		participating. There are rumors of
		secret meetings with North Korean
		representatives, but U.S. officials
		insist the North must first hold
		democratic elections, and halt its
		nuclear weapons program -- as they
		claimed to have done back in 1995.

We CUT TO a heated debate in the UN SECURITY COUNCIL.

Then ARTILLERY FIRE over the Korean DMZ.

The SCENE returns to LAX.

				REPORTER (VO)
			(continuing)
		Tensions remain high since last
		year's skirmishes between North Korea
		and the U.S. So any chance of the
		communist North joining the Pacific
		Partners seems highly unlikely.

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  FREMONT PLACE - DAY

An exclusive, walled-off section of Hancock Park. There's only
one route in and out, past a manned guardhouse on Wilshire.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

A Colonial-style mansion, surrounded by an imposing, wrought-
iron fence. There is a bronze plaque, in English and Korean,
next to the entranceway:
     
				Consulate
				 of the
		Democratic People's Republic of Korea

The driveway gate opens and a long, black Mercedes with tinted
windows and diplomatic license plates glides out.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

An alert North Korean CORPORAL watches the perimeter MONITORS.
He pushes a switch to close the gate behind the Mercedes.

EXT.  UTILITY POLE - OLYMPIC BLVD - DAY

From atop a pole outside the south wall, a man with binoculars
overlooks the private streets of Fremont Place.

HIS POV - THROUGH BINOCULARS

as the Mercedes cruises through the quiet neighborhood.

BACK TO SCENE

The man, PAUL JAVAL, is thirtyish, nervous; with short, sandy
hair. He takes the binoculars away from his face and we see
his eyes -- they're a strange, unnaturally light gray.

Javal takes an ORANGE PILL from an unlabeled prescription
bottle and pops it into his mouth. He climbs down the pole to
a van with a phone company logo on it.



EXT.  WILSHIRE BLVD - DAY

The Mercedes comes out of the Fremont Place gate, and turns
into the heavy morning traffic.

INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

It is extremely quiet, due to inch-thick glass on the windows
and 4,000 pounds of armor plating on the car's chassis.

The DRIVER is a North Korean Army Major. On the seat beside
him is an AMD-74, a 5.45x39mm-caliber machine gun.

A HAND from the back seat darts between the front seats and
turns on the RADIO to a ROCK station. The Driver turns it off.

NEW ANGLE

The hand belongs to 10-year-old SAM KE HAN. Sam sits back and
sighs to his sister, JOY (15). Between them sits a middle-aged
Scandinavian GOVERNESS.

				SAM
		I can't stand it -- half an hour to
		get to the stupid school every
		morning... with no music...
			(Korean; subtitled)
		[Just our damn Nanny...]

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

Javal's van, also with tinted windows, turns onto Crenshaw. It
follows the Mercedes, several cars behind it.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Javal, wired, drums on the steering wheel while driving. He
glances at some expertly constructed, radio-control REMOTE
UNITS sitting on the seat next to him.

EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

Traffic is moving at about 35 MPH. The Mercedes merges onto
the freeway, heading west. Javal's van follows.

The thumping of a RAP SONG rattles the other drivers' fillings
as a LOWRIDER with its stereo turned up to "11" cruises by.

INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Even 500 watts of bass cannot penetrate the armored silence.
The Driver scans the road, wary but sensing no danger. He puts
on his blinker to take the 405 South exit.



EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

The van follows, now directly behind the Mercedes, in a
procession of vehicles going up the long, curved overpass
arcing 100 feet above the 10, toward the 405.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

As they approach the crest of the overpass, Javal flips a
switch on his radio-control unit...

CLOSE - ROAD SURFACE OF OVERPASS

Six small SEMICIRCLES, exact replicas of the stay-alert bumps
on the white lines of the overpass, EXPLODE. They spew hundreds
of sharp, triangular nails across the roadway. Immediately,
scores of tires on passing cars BLOW OUT...

WIDER

Causing, 50 yards ahead of the Mercedes and van, the most
hellacious, gut-wrenching, piss-your-pants, chain-reaction
PILE-UP you can imagine.

Dozens of drivers LOSE CONTROL of their vehicles... sideswipe
their neighbors... grind against the guard rails. Some
fishtail into 180's, smashing headlong into the traffic still
coming onto the overpass.

Brakes squeal, people scream, metal crumples, airbags deploy,
glass shatters.

And then it gets really nasty...

A Honda gets jammed under a truck hauling cinder blocks. The
truck JACKKNIFES, tipping over like a drunken giant.

It SMASHES through the concrete wall and guard rail...

Along with several cars and their SCREAMING OCCUPANTS, swept
over the edge by the truck like discarded soda cans.

They plummet through space, CRASHING onto the freeway below.

INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Sam, Joy, and the Governess brace themselves as the Driver
slams on the brakes. He barely avoids hitting anything.

				DRIVER
			(Korean)
		[Stay in the car.]



EXT.  FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY

A nightmare scene of smoke, twisted wrecks, dazed victims. The
Mercedes and van sit motionless in the backed-up traffic.

INT./EXT.  JAVAL'S VAN & ROADWAY - DAY

Javal slides open a TRAP DOOR on the floor of the van. He
slips a wheeled, mechanic's repair platform through it.

ANGLE WITH JAVAL

as, unnoticed amid the chaos, he lies on the platform and
rolls under the Mercedes.

The undercarriage of the Mercedes is armored with steel. Javal
stops at a patch of perforations -- an air exchange vent. He
attaches a slim DEVICE over the vent, flips a switch on it,
then rolls back toward the van.

INT.  MERCEDES - DAY

Oblivious to Javal's actions below them, everyone watches as
police and news helicopters circle above. Then, some CHP
motorcycles straddle the lanes and zoom by.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

Sweating, Javal sits back in the driver's seat and checks
another radio unit. Working.

EXT.  FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY

The CHP has cleared a path through the devastation, and
traffic trickles through. As the Mercedes and the van pass by,
Javal looks proudly at the misery he's wrought. He follows the
Mercedes onto the 405 south.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Javal drives behind the Mercedes, with one hand on the radio
unit. The Mercedes signals to take the Venice exit.

Javal fingers the radio unit, itching to use it...

But he PASSES by the Mercedes as it gets off the freeway.

INSERT ANGLE - UNDER THE MERCEDES

Javal's device is armed, and waiting...

							FADE TO:



EXT.  SIERRA BONITA AVENUE - CARSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A pretty street in the Miracle Mile, lined with neat, single-
family homes. Timed SPRINKLER systems water some of the yards.

Every house on the block except the one we're in front of has
a "For Sale" sign on the lawn. From the weathered looks of the
signs, they've been there for quite a while.

INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

It's a hot night. The ceiling fan above the bed spins slowly.

PETE CARSON tosses restlessly in bed, the sheets half-covering
him. Next to him his wife, MIRANDA KNOLL, snores contentedly.

Carson is in his late thirties, outdoorsy, with a tight,
muscular build. Emotionally he's tightly-wound as well.

Miranda is 35, raven-haired, sensible, pretty. She believes
above all else that one should never raise one's voice.

Carson groans... he's DREAMING...

							CUT TO:

EXT.  BEVERLY DRIVE - (CARSON'S DREAM) - DAY

Quick, SILENT IMAGES: A street cordoned off with police tape.
Cops, SWAT teams, FBI surround BEVERLY THRIFT, a bank.

Carson, younger, hair shorter, sits in an FBI COMMAND TRUCK
across from the bank. Covering the mouthpiece of the phone in
his hand, he's arguing with the OTHER AGENTS in the truck.

Suddenly, a huge, fiery EXPLOSION blows out the front of the
bank building. Horrified, Carson runs toward it...

							CUT TO:

INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM AND HALLWAY - NIGHT

Carson is snapped awake by a CAR ALARM going off outside.

				CARSON
		Son of a bitch!

He bolts out of bed, wearing nothing but a pair of striped
bikini briefs. Miranda rolls over, sleepy, unconcerned...

				MIRANDA
		Pete... please... we have to be up
		early tomorrow. Call the police.



				CARSON
		Yeah, right.

He races down the hall -- right past the house alarm keypad,
its LCD reading "ARMED."

He grabs an aluminum baseball bat from the umbrella stand.
Forgetting to disarm the house alarm, he yanks the front door
open. The house alarm begins SHRIEKING.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		Shit!

MIRANDA

pulls the pillows over her head and sighs.

				MIRANDA
		Not again...

EXT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Carson comes around to the driveway, which is illuminated by
the streetlight --

Where two 20-ish ASSHOLES are sitting in his 1965 Mustang
convertible, their presence courtesy of a huge cut they've
made in the otherwise-perfect ragtop.

Car-theft tools in a leather case between them, they're prying
the ignition switch out of the dashboard.

Asshole #1 spots Carson. He gets out of the car, wielding a
crowbar. His partner keeps working.

NEW ANGLE

Asshole #1 lunges viciously, swiping at Carson with the
crowbar, taking a piece out of his side. Carson starts
BLEEDING profusely, but he's too pissed to notice.

Carson uses his bat to take the offensive. They go at each
other like combatants in a swordfight, the CLANKING of metal
echoing through the neighborhood along with the screaming
house and car ALARMS, and frantic neighborhood DOGS.

Surprised at Carson's fury and strength, Asshole #1 backs onto
the lawn, oblivious to the running SPRINKLERS.

As he backs away, his shoe catches on one of the sprinkler
heads. It breaks off, and a huge GEYSER of water sprays out.

Carson holds his bat in both hands and jams the front of it
into Asshole #1's breadbasket. He doubles over.

Carson grabs Asshole #1's arm, and pulls it quickly against
his raised knee. There is a SNAP and a loud howl as the arm
breaks, and Carson tosses him aside.

Seeing this, Asshole #2 gives up on the car. He takes off
toward the street. Carson runs to head him off, but he's a lot
faster in his Air Jordans than Carson is in his bare feet.

WIDER

Carson grabs the metal lid from a garbage can at the curb and
FLINGS it like a huge Frisbee. It sails across the street --

And NAILS Asshole #2's head. He kisses the pavement, stunned.

Carson runs up and grabs him, but he pulls out a long, sharp
screwdriver and jabs at Carson with it.

Then, blue flashing lights appear from around the corner: A
WESTEC Chevy Blazer. Two uniformed GUARDS get out, and fumble
with their sidearms.

				WESTEC GUARD
		Everybody... chill! Bikini boy! On
		the ground!

Asshole #2 is still trying to gouge Carson with the
screwdriver. Carson glares at the dopey Guards.

				CARSON
		Asshole was trying to boost my car!

ANGLE ACROSS STREET

Carson's fiftyish, black, next-door NEIGHBOR, wearing pajamas
and a robe, comes out of his house. Carson sees him.

				CARSON
		Mike -- call 911!

				NEIGHBOR
		Been trying...
			(has a cordless phone)
		It's busy.
			(to Guards; re Carson)
		He's the good guy, you schumcks.

The Guards seem to get it. Without warning, one takes out a
TASER and ZAPS Asshole #2. Carson lets go just in time.

CLOSER

Holding his bleeding side, Carson walks back to his house. He
notices the "Neighborhood Watch" sign has graffiti spray-
painted on it. He touches it -- the paint is still wet. His
Neighbor shrugs -- whatta ya gonna do?

The PAPER GUY drives by... and tosses Carson's newspaper right
under the gushing SPRINKLER.

				CARSON
		I hate this fuckin' town.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - ESTABLISHING - DAY

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - DAY

Joy is standing on the toilet, blowing cigarette smoke into
the exhaust fan. Someone KNOCKS on the door. She flicks the
cigarette into the toilet, puts a ZIPPO LIGHTER in her pocket.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY

Joy opens the bathroom door. Sam is standing there, grinning.

				JOY
		There are six bathrooms in this
		house, Sam.

				SAM
			(fanning the air)
		But only one with a smoking section.

She quickly closes the door behind her. Sam laughs.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DINING ROOM - DAY

Sam and Joy sit at the table. AMBASSADOR HAN and MRS. HAN are
having breakfast: radish soup, kimchi and grilled fish.

Ambassador Han reads through the morning's faxed communiquÈs.
He's 43, rarely smiles, and hates living in the U.S. He's
dressed in an impeccably-tailored, Valentino two-piece suit.

Mrs. Han is slender, soft-spoken, but as iron-willed as her
husband. She, however, is quick to smile. She's wearing a
summery dress with a white sweater over her shoulders.

Ambassador Han pulls the front of Sam's shirt to reveal the
"Nirvana" logo on his T-shirt.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(Korean)
		[Go change.]

Ambassador Han's X-ray stare turns to Joy.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(continuing)
		[You smell like a fireplace.]

A BUTLER appears with a phone. He WHISPERS to Mrs. Han.

				MRS. HAN
		It's the Governess...
			(into phone)
		Hello, Hilda...

CUTAWAY - CLOSE ON GOVERNESS

as she speaks into a cellular phone. She's extremely nervous.
We cannot see her surroundings.

				GOVERNESS
			(thru phone)
		Mrs. Han... I am very sick today...

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DINING ROOM - DAY

				MRS. HAN
			(into phone)
		We will see you next week...
			(hangs up; smiles to kids)
		It appears I'll be taking you to
		school.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

In the back of his van, Javal pats the Governess' hand.

				JAVAL
		Very good. You may go now...

He speaks with a slight accent, French, perhaps. He pops an
orange pill, then unlatches the rear doors of the van. With a
quick glance back at him, she goes to open the doors.

Javal grabs a plastic tarp and throws it over the Governess'
upper body. He puts his arm across her neck, flicks open a
gravity knife and PLUNGES it through the tarp, into her chest.

He drops her on the floor of the van and fastidiously wipes a
small smudge of blood from his hand with a handkerchief.

INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BATHROOM AND BEDROOM - DAY

Carson steps out of the shower. He looks exhausted. Toweling
off, he goes into the bedroom, where Miranda is riding an
exercise bike, listening to music on headphones and reading
the sprinkler-soaked newspaper, all while watching the TV.

ANGLE ON TV

A perky blonde traffic reporter, BOBBI MARCHFELDER, talks to
us from a local NEWS COPTER.



				BOBBI
			(on TV)
		...Good morning, Summit Day! It's
		gonna be the Super Bowl, the 4th of
		July, the Olympics and Woodstock all
		rolled into one! All over town
		there'll be parades, concerts,
		rallies, festivals... So get out
		there everyone, but plan your drive-
		time accordingly! This is Bobbi
		Marchfelder, your Eye in the Sky...

We CUT TO the White House lawn, where the PRESIDENT is about
to board a helicopter.

				MORNING ANCHOR (VO)
			(on TV)
		The President is on his way...

				PRESIDENT
			(on TV)
		...It's an honor hosting my fellow
		leaders in Los Angeles, the capitol
		city of the Pacific Rim...

We CUT BACK to the studio and the MORNING ANCHOR.

				MORNING ANCHOR
			(on TV)
		We'll see the menu for Mayor
		Simpson's Brentwood barbecue, right
		after this...

We CUT TO a MUSICAL MONTAGE of preparations for the events
around town.

BACK TO SCENE

As the MUSIC swells, Carson turns the TV off.

				MIRANDA
		I was watching that.

				CARSON
		If I hear one more Beach Boys song,
		I'll shoot myself.

Miranda points at the headphones -- she can't hear him.

				CARSON
			(continuing; while smiling)
		I said, if we were having sex once in
		a while, you wouldn't need to ride
		that fucking bike every morning.



				MIRANDA
			(hasn't heard a thing)
		Be right with you...

As Carson dresses, we get a LOOK at their bedroom -- Miranda's
nightstand has two neat stacks of periodicals on it, with Los
Angeles magazine and Psychology Today on the top of them.

Carson's nightstand is overflowing with books and magazines
about other cities and states: Wonderland Washington;
Magnificent Oregon; Welcome to North Carolina."

INT./EXT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - PATIO & KITCHEN - DAY

Miranda, dressed in a conservative skirt, jacket, black shoes,
is out on the patio. Her breakfast -- a bowl of fruit and
wheat germ -- sits on the patio table while she waters some
sickly-looking ROSE BUSHES in a planter.

Carson, dressed in shirt and tie, looking beat, fries a steak
and three eggs in butter. He comes outside with his breakfast
and a magazine article: "American Expatriates in New Zealand."

				MIRANDA
			(looks him over)
		Have you gotten any sleep lately?

				CARSON
			(ignores the question)
		Shop's gonna tow the car in --
		goddamn ignition's trashed.

				MIRANDA
		Take mine. I'll ride in with Diane.

Carson watches as she carefully picks the dead leaves off the
rose bushes.

				CARSON
		You ask me, those suckers are a lost
		cause.

She continues, then glances at the article Carson is reading.

				MIRANDA
		It's not for you.

				CARSON
		You mean it's not for you.

				MIRANDA
		I don't chase car thieves in my
		underwear. C'mon, you'd die of
		boredom if we ever sold this house
		and moved.



				CARSON
		I'd die of shock, from finding
		anyone dumb enough to buy the place.
		Even for what it's worth now.

				MIRANDA
		Lots of people bought at the top of
		the market...

				CARSON
		That sure cheers me right up.

				MIRANDA
		I don't know why we even talk about
		it. The city's not the problem. So
		we move. It wouldn't matter. What's
		that saying: "Wherever you go, there
		you are."

Carson just looks at her. Reaching for the salt, he winces
from the cut in his side.

				MIRANDA
			(continuing)
		I hope you're current on your
		tetanus booster. Was it worth it?

				CARSON
		One cut... two assholes in the
		hospital... Yep.

Carson glances at his watch and gets up.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		Well, another day of baby-sitting my
		favorite bunch of people...

He grabs a Bianchi shoulder holster with a Sig-Sauer P-229,
9mm pistol, straps it on, then pulls on a blue windbreaker.
Emblazoned on the back are large yellow letters: FBI.

				MIRANDA
		Ask for a transfer.

				CARSON
		They're not gonna transfer me. You
		know damn well why I was bumped down
		to guard duty...
			(as he's leaving)
		My outstanding people skills.

Miranda tries to return to tending her roses. But instead, she
sadly watches him go.



EXT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - DAY

A look of sorrow crosses Carson's face as he watches some
YOUNG KIDS laugh and shove, getting onto a school bus.

He then glances at his wounded Mustang, parked in the street.
He spots something on the windshield: A pink parking ticket.

The parking sign above the graffiti-stained Neighborhood Watch
sign reads: Street Cleaning - Friday 8-10 AM.

				CARSON
		I hate this fuckin' town.

Carson CHIRPS open Miranda's car: a red Volvo 960.

As he pulls away, we SEE a bumper sticker on the car: a circle
and slash through cartoon weapons on one side, cartoon teddy
bears on the other, and "Arms Are For Hugging" in between.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

The Driver backs the Mercedes out of the garage behind the
Consulate. We notice there is ANOTHER MERCEDES parked inside.

Mrs. Han, Sam and Joy come outside. They hear some heartfelt
SWEARING:

				ANGRY VOICE (OS)
		Goddamn Limey overpriced piece a
		shit...

THEIR POV

In the driveway across the street, a man in a business suit
has his head under the hood of a brand-new Jaguar convertible.
The JAG OWNER's 15-year-old, blonde daughter, LISA, sits in
the car with her schoolbooks in her lap.

JOY

turns to Mrs. Han:

				JOY
		Can we give Lisa a ride?

INT./EXT.  MERCEDES - DAY

It pulls into the driveway across the street. The Jag Owner is
still SWEARING mightily. Lisa climbs into the Mercedes.

				LISA
		Hey, Joy... Sam...

Joy rolls the window up and the SOUND of cursing disappears.



				LISA
			(continuing)
		Excellent -- I can't hear him!

				SAM
			(raps on window)
		The glass is an inch thick.
			(points to doors, roof)
		Armor-plated. Bulletproof. Bomb-
		proof.

				LISA
		Perfect car for L.A.
			(looks back at her Dad)
		Starts, too.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

As the Mercedes travels its usual route down Crenshaw, Javal's
van begins following it.

INSERT ANGLE - UNDER THE MERCEDES

where Javal's DEVICE is attached, still waiting...

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

A dark-green government Dodge pulls up and parks behind one
just like it on a paved area near the Consulate gate.

DAVE JUAREZ, (chubby, 40, Mexican-American, a desk jockey) gets
out of the Dodge and hangs an FBI shield over his top pocket.

He glances over at North Korean Security Chief COLONEL LEE,
(45), who has paused inside the gate to regard Dave, and the
outside world, with profound contempt.

Dave, attachÈ case in one hand and notebook computer in the
other, walks to a 10-by-15 detached guardhouse on the far
corner of the property, just outside the high fence.

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Inside are two desks and four chairs, a console of
communication equipment, a microwave and a Mr. Coffee.

Dave enters. Two FBI agents, finishing their shift, gather
their belongings: ROBBINS (late 20's; male; thinning hair) and
SABATINI, (early 30's; cute; dark, bobbed hair; female).

They wear blue FBI blazers and have standard-FBI-issue 10mm
Heckler & Koch MP-5 machine pistols in oversized shoulder
rigs. Dave is in civilian clothes, and is not armed.



				ROBBINS
		Yo, Dave the Computer Man! Actually
		escaped the office!

				DAVE
		I'm doin' field upgrades. Gives 'em
		a chance to hose out my cage.

He glances through the window at Colonel Lee.

				DAVE
			(continuing)
		Who's the fuckin' gargoyle?

				ROBBINS
		Their Chief of Security, Colonel Lee.

Sabatini makes the jerk-off sign with her hand.

				SABATINI
		"Chuckles," as we're inclined to
		call him.
			(yawns; flops in a chair)
		Friggin' graveyard shift...

				ROBBINS
		Love to know what dope made it the
		Bureau's job to give full-time
		protection to foreign consulates.
			(offers coffee to Dave)
		Cup a mud?

				DAVE
		Not if you made it. Why don't you
		get Sabatini to brew the java? She's
		the alleged chick.

				SABATINI
		Blow me.

				DAVE
		Where's Carson?

				SABATINI
		On his way. Some creeps tried to rip
		off his Mustang last night.
			(beat; solemnly)
		They cut the ragtop.

				DAVE
		Motherfuckers...

Dave takes three PCMCIA computer cards from his attachÈ case.



				DAVE
			(continuing)
		Latest and greatest. Wireless
		network link-ups.

				SABATINI
		Whoa, slow down, I'm gonna pee.

				ROBBINS
		Me, too.

				DAVE
		Ingrates.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

The van drives in the lane alongside the Mercedes.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

HUMMING, Javal drives with one hand, while tapping with his
other on the top of the radio-controlled remote box.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

As they approach the light at Washington Blvd, just turning
yellow, Javal's van gets in front of the Mercedes.

Their lanes stop for the red light. A FRUIT VENDOR holding a
bag of oranges walks from car to car.

Javal slips the van into neutral and lets it roll back until
his rear bumper taps gently against the Mercedes' front bumper.

INT.  MERCEDES - INCLUDE POV THROUGH REAR VIEW MIRROR - DAY

The Driver hits the HORN. The van doesn't move. The Driver
glances in the rear-view:

There's a Jeep Cherokee tight on his tail, and the BLACK LADY
in it is busy dealing with a carpool full of 8-year-old KIDS.

The Driver looks at Mrs. Han, who's peering out the side
window, fascinated by the African-American-themed storefronts.
They're all festooned with Summit-related banners, and SHOP
OWNERS are preparing for a community sidewalk bazaar.

Sam, bored, stuffs several pieces of GUM into his mouth.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - SAME

Javal flips the switch on his radio-controlled remote.



INSERT

Under the Mercedes, the device Javal planted there begins to
emit thick, white CS TEAR GAS.

INT.  MERCEDES - DAY

The GAS pours in through the ventilation system. Everyone
inside starts coughing and choking uncontrollably. The Driver
grabs his AMD-74 machine gun and pops the door locks.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

The Driver, Mrs. Han, Joy, Sam and Lisa pile out of the car.

Jittering with excitement, fear and speed, Javal hops out of
his van, holding a Benelli M-1, a semi-automatic shotgun.

He SHOOTS the Driver in the chest. The BLAST from the shotgun
muzzle, however, is unlike anything we've ever seen before: it
is blindingly BRIGHT, even in broad daylight, belching a huge
cluster of glowing, white-hot magnesium.

The Driver flies back against the Mercedes, EMPTYING his
machine gun into the air. The wound in his chest is full of
BURNING magnesium shrapnel.

WIDER

The other drivers in the intersection see this and go
completely nuts. Some duck for cover under their dashboards.
Others peel away. A few COLLIDE with oncoming traffic.

The Carpool Lady in the Cherokee pushes the kids down on the
floor. The Fruit Vendor hides by rolling under a car.

Sam and Joy are incapacitated by tear-gas coughing fits. Mrs.
Han stumbles toward them, trying to get them to run away.
Javal PUNCHES her, knocking her down.

He turns to Lisa, surprised to see her. Sweating, he points
the shotgun at her... almost pulls the trigger... then notices
Mrs. Han's expression of horror and thinks the better of it.

He spots a MOTORIST in a Ford Escort, peering cautiously over
his dashboard to get a look at the action.

Javal SHOOTS the Motorist through the windshield with another
bright, searing blast of magnesium. The Motorist and the
entire front of his car burst into FLAMES.

Mrs. Han is on her knees, sobbing. Javal grabs her by the arm
and pulls her to the back of the van. He opens the doors.



				JAVAL
		You see that I'm serious in my
		intention, yes?
			(she nods)
		If you cooperate, you and your
		children will be home for dinner
		tonight.

He tightens his grip on her. She nods again, then looks at the
kids. Javal shoves her, Sam, Joy and Lisa into the van.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

He grabs three pairs of handcuffs off a C-shaped bar welded on
both ends to the inside of the van. He handcuffs one of Mrs.
Han's arms, passes the chain through the bar, then handcuffs
the other. He does the same with Sam; then handcuffs one of
Joy's arms, passes the chain through and attaches the other
handcuff to Lisa.

Javal hops in his seat and drives away on Washington.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

Several people, including the Carpool Lady, rush over to the
Driver, who lies DEAD and SMOLDERING on the ground.

His hand is halfway inside his bloody pants pocket, holding a
small plastic card with the Consulate's phone number on it.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Colonel Lee and a North Korean Army OFFICER come running out.
ANOTHER OFFICER starts up a car in the back of the house.

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Robbins and Sabatini see the commotion and go to investigate.
Dave follows.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Ambassador Han runs out. He has a stricken look on his face.

				COLONEL LEE
			(Korean; to Ambassador Han)
		[You must stay here.]

Ambassador Han nods. The FBI agents run up. To them:

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		Someone took my family!

The agents look at each other -- holy shit! Colonel Lee's car
SCREECHES to a stop. Sabatini stands in front of it.



				SABATINI
		You got no jurisdiction outside
		this property!

Colonel Lee shoves a big, ugly Tokorev 7.62x25mm-caliber
pistol in her face as he's opening the car door.

				SABATINI
			(continuing)
		Shit!
			(to Ambassador Han)
		Yank his fuckin' leash!

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		My men are going!

Colonel Lee jumps into the car and it screeches away, almost
running Sabatini over.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(continuing; to Sabatini)
		It's a white telephone van, driving
		west on Washington Boulevard.

The agents rush back to their guardhouse. Dave's government
Dodge is blocking theirs.

				ROBBINS
		Keys!

Dave tosses them to Robbins. Sabatini shoves Dave into the
back seat. He looks at her, dumbfounded.

				SABATINI
		You're ridin' shotgun.

INT.  DAVE'S DODGE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Dave is thrown against the back of the seat by the ACCELERATION.

				ROBBINS
		Cherry?

				DAVE
		Under the seat.

Sabatini grabs the red flashing light, puts it on the dashboard.

				ROBBINS
		Siren?

				DAVE
		I don't know! I'm never in a fuckin'
		hurry..!



EXT.  FREMONT PLACE - DAY

Just as they race out of Fremont Place past the guard gate,
Carson, in Miranda's Volvo, comes in on the other side.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson sees the agents in the Dodge and floors the Volvo. He
fishtails, making a U-turn.

He straddles the lanes on Wilshire to pull up next to them.
All the cars in front of them swerve to clear out of the way.

He rolls down his window. Sabatini shouts over to him:

				SABATINI
		Someone snatched Han's family! White
		phone van, westbound on Washington!

Carson looks like he's been punched in the stomach.

				CARSON
		Give me a secure radio!

Sabatini takes a small two-way MOTOROLA RADIO out of her
pocket and throws it through her window to Carson. Dropping it
in his lap, he punches the gas. Robbins floors Dave's piece-of-
shit Dodge, trying to keep up.

EXT.  FEDERAL BUILDING, WESTWOOD - ESTABLISHING - DAY

INT.  FEDERAL BUILDING - STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICES - DAY

Diplomatic Liaison EARL WALTHER is using the reflection in his
office window to adjust his necktie. Walther is 30, good-
looking, black; a GS lifer working his way up the ranks by
virtue of his quiet competence.

A CO-WORKER sticks his head into the office, then shields his
eyes from the sight of Walther's sharp new suit.

				CO-WORKER
		Someone's been to Nordstroms, big

				WALTHER
		Clothes make the man.

				CO-WORKER
		But does the man make enough for the

				WALTHER
			(smiles)
		The man makes payments on his Visa.

Walther's SECRETARY rushes in.



				SECRETARY
		Mr. Walther... priority line!

				WALTHER
			(into phone)
		This is Diplomatic Liaison Earl
		Walther... What's the nature of your
		emer --
			(grimaces)
		Aw, Jesus... not today...
			(beat)
		I'll inform channels and get a copter
		in the air. For God's sake, keep it
		quiet. Do what you can, but don't
		endanger civilians or the family!

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson drives with one hand, while holding the radio.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		You bet -- nice and easy.

Real easy, until he narrowly MISSES a bunch of cars when
SCREECHING around a corner.

INT.  FEDERAL BUILDING - STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICES - DAY

Walther presses the intercom button on the phone.

				WALTHER
			(into phone)
		Get the Secretary of State on the
		horn.
			(listens)
		I know he left already. I'm familiar
		with the concept of time zones. Find
		his ass.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson turns the frequency on his two-way.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Robbins, Sabatini... Chopper's on
		its way.

EXT.  WASHINGTON BLVD - DAY

Driving skillfully, Carson edges past the North Koreans.



INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

And then, Carson can't believe it: he spots Javal's van, a
couple blocks ahead, driving at normal speed.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Check it out! Ahead, on the right!

				SABATINI (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Think it's them?

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Yeah... but it seems too easy... I'll
		move up; he won't suspect a civilian
		car. Stay back, then get on his ass
		when I signal. We'll box him in.

He looks over at Colonel Lee, whose car is pacing his.

				CARSON
			(continuing; into radio)
		If the Mod Squad gets in your way,
		don't be shy about getting 'em out.

				SABATINI (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Copy that one.

INT.  COLONEL LEE'S CAR - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Glaring, Colonel Lee looks over at the FBI cars as they pass.

INT.  DAVE'S DODGE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Sabatini pulls out her machine pistol, and tosses the two-way
to Dave. He looks scared, and carsick.

				SABATINI
		Don't puke... I hate when guys puke!

EXT.  WASHINGTON BLVD - DAY

Carson tries to approach Javal without drawing his attention.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

He still drives at the same speed as the surrounding traffic.

HIS POV

As Carson nonchalantly passes, Javal NOTICES the government-
issue two-way radio sitting on the seat of Carson's Volvo.



JAVAL

grins... it's show-time. He STOMPS on the gas.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Pissed that he's been made, Carson speeds up.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Driving fast, Javal makes a hard right. As the van leans with
the turn, something rolls out from under a sheet of canvas on
the floor -- the Governess' BODY, bloodied and grotesque under
the plastic tarp it's wrapped in.

Joy starts SCREAMING, as does everyone else when they see it.

Javal pulls out a Beretta Centurion 9mm pistol and FIRES a
deafening round through the roof of the van.

				JAVAL
		I need to concentrate!

EXT.  WASHINGTON BLVD - DAY

During a lull in traffic, a WELL-DRESSED WOMAN jaywalks across
the street. An LAPD black-and-white changes lanes and puts on
its flashing lights. As two COPS write her a ticket...

Around the corner TWO MEN make a quick exchange of money and a
vial of crack.

NEW ANGLE

The Cops do notice Javal speeding by, with Carson's Volvo, the
FBI Dodge and Colonel Lee's car in hot pursuit. They shove the
ticket in the Well-Dressed Woman's hand and hop in their car.

EXT.  LA CIENEGA BLVD / SIDE STREETS - DAY

Javal turns onto the side streets -- rows of run-down
apartment buildings. He takes a circuitous route, gaining a
one-block lead on Carson and the others.

Then, he makes a sudden turn into a one-way alley.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Javal hits a remote garage door opener. Ahead, rickety doors
on one of a line of detached garages facing the alley OPEN up.

Across from the garage, parked parallel against the back of an
empty building, we notice a duplicate van. It's facing the
same direction as Javal is driving.

Javal slams on the brakes, stopping just past the garage, and
then quickly backs up into the garage.

INT.  ALLEYWAY GARAGE / JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

As he pulls in, we catch GLIMPSES of the van slipping backwards
into a FIBERGLASS SUPERSTRUCTURE that fits tightly around the
rear two-thirds of it. As the van comes to a stop, several snap-
buckles on the edge of the superstructure spring closed.

Javal reaches out the van window and pulls on a rope hanging
from the ceiling of the garage. The rope releases the door
from the opening mechanism, so it immediately falls CLOSED.

Then, Javal turns several switches on another of his neatly-
constructed remotes:

INT.  DUPLICATE VAN - SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY

Steel straps are holding the steering wheel rigid.

A set of relays, triggered remotely, start the engine;

Engage the transmission;

And supply fuel to the carburetor.

EXT.  ALLEYWAYS

The duplicate van takes off down the alley. Just as it gets up
to speed, Carson and the others round the corner into the alley
behind it. As far as they know, they're still chasing Javal.

The alley is several blocks long, running parallel to the main
road, separated at each block by perpendicular streets. The
duplicate van races along, scraping against parked cars and
the rear walls of buildings...

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		He's gonna wrap it around something!

EXT.  ALLEYWAYS - DAY

Indeed, as the duplicate van crosses a street, cars swerve to
avoid hitting it. It continues into the next alley.

Up ahead, a garbage truck lumbers into the far end of the
alley, its metal lift-rods extended to pick up a dumpster.

				CARSON (OS)
		Oh, shit...

The duplicate van CRASHES into the garbage truck and EXPLODES.



NEW ANGLE

Carson, horrified, jumps out of his car. Robbins and Sabatini
run up. They have to hold Carson away from the burning van.
Dave hurries to the back of a building and gets sick.

Colonel Lee, wide-eyed with anger, gets in Carson's face.

				COLONEL LEE
		You should not have interfered!

Carson shoves Colonel Lee out of his way, hard.

				CARSON
		I'm in no mood...

Colonel Lee comes back, ready for a fight. Carson is happy to
oblige, but Robbins grabs Carson's arm.

				ROBBINS
		Forget about him!

By now, ONLOOKERS have begun to gather, as LAPD black-and
whites and helicopters converge on the area.

EXT.  ALLEYWAY GARAGE - DAY

A block away, the garage door opens, and we hear something
eerie and unexpected: a scratchy, music-box kids' SONG, coming
from a loudspeaker.

Javal's van pulls out and we see its TRANSFORMATION: The
superstructure surrounding the body of the van makes it look
like a graffiti-covered, unlicensed ice cream vendor.

EXT.  ALLEYWAYS - DAY

The entrance of the alley is blocked by a black-and-white. So,
accompanied by the SONG, Javal drives along the one-way alley
in his camouflaged van, passing unnoticed by the authorities.

Anguished, Carson is staring at the BURNING duplicate van...

							CUT TO:

EXT.  BEVERLY DRIVE - (FLASHBACK) - DAY

Beverly Thrift EXPLODES and BURNS...

							CUT TO:

EXT.  ALLEYWAYS - DAY

Carson tries to shake the memory away. He looks around, sensing
that something isn't right, then turns to the other agents.



				CARSON
		Let's get back to the Consulate.

Off their perplexed looks, we

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

One room, bathroom and kitchenette. A laptop computer and
peripherals are on a table, along with some cell phones, a
toolbox, and some jumbles of electronic circuitry.

In the main room, there are three large Lazy-Boy easy chairs,
side by side, facing a 27-inch TV on a stand. A cloth covers
two OBJECTS sitting atop the TV.

The door opens. Mrs. Han, Joy, Sam, and Lisa walk in, rigid
with fear. Javal, Beretta 9mm in hand, comes in behind them
and closes the door. Javal strips off his sweat-soaked shirt
and wipes his face with it. Mrs. Han realizes he's wired to
the moon... and it terrifies her.

				JAVAL
		Does anyone need to use the rest
		room? This will be your last
		opportunity for a few hours.
			(no takers)
		Very well. Mrs. Han, Sam, Joy,
		please sit here.
			(indicates the Lazy Boys;
			then turns to Lisa)
		And you... what is your name?

				LISA
			(after a beat)
		Lisa...

Still holding the Beretta, he grabs a polo shirt from the
closet and pulls it on. As the family sits in the chairs:

				JAVAL
		No, Mrs. Han, this one. Thank you.

He takes a pair of handcuffs out of his pants pocket. He tries
to handcuff Lisa, hands behind her back, but she resists.

				JAVAL
			(continuing; sotto)
		You afford me some additional
		bargaining power. But not much.

She wilts. Javal cuffs her to the handles of the refrigerator.
He puts a strip of duct tape from his tool box across her mouth.

He uncovers one of the items atop the TV: An electronic box with
three pairs of oversized, LED VU meters on the front of it.

We NOTICE neat lines of wires running from each of the chairs
up into it. Javal flips one of a row of switches on it; a
green light and the meters come to life.

				JAVAL
			(continuing)
		There. No taping your mouths, no
		restraints. Please remain still
		while I explain. The meters on the
		left indicate sound pressure --
		Decibels. There are microphones on
		your chair backs. If you raise your
		voices above certain level, putting
		your meter in the red zone for more
		than one sustained second, the
		circuit will be closed.
			(beat)
		The right meters indicate motion.
		There are pressure sensors inside the
		armrests and seats. The sensors don't
		like to get wet, so I hope you were
		honest about not needing to use the
		loo. If you make any excess
		movements, or try to leave your
		chair, the circuit will be closed.

				MRS. HAN
		I don't understand...

She looks at her sound meter, which jumped close to the red.

				MRS. HAN
			(continuing; softly)
		What happens if the circuit closes?

				JAVAL
		Kaboom...

He uncovers the other item atop the TV -- a one-pound brick of
C-4 high explosive with the detonation mechanism jammed into
it. Mrs. Han gasps and begins to PANIC.

				JAVAL
			(continuing)
		Easy... deep breath...
			(to the kids)
		Do each of you understand?

They nod. Tears roll down Joy's face.

				JAVAL
			(continuing)
		Keep your wits, and all will be fine.

He flips another switch and the green light turns yellow. He
then turns on the TV. COVERAGE of the Summit is everywhere.

				COMMENTATOR #1
			(on TV)
		...Not since the '84 Olympics has the
		whole city had an such an opportunity --

Javal turns the channel to a SOAP, and MUTES it. He starts
pacing, and glances at his watch. It's 9:15 AM.

INT.  GOVERNMENT HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Earl Walther looks through the window as his copter lands on
the lawn behind the North Korean Consulate.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

As the copter lands, Carson comes out to meet Walther.

				WALTHER
		Carson?
			(Carson nods)
		Walther. Who told the Ambassador?

				CARSON
		His Security Chief.
			(beat)
		There was a civilian with them --
		fifteen-year-old girl from across
		the street. We're trying to reach
		the parents.

				WALTHER
		Goddamn it...
			(sotto)
		Look, Mrs. Han was the North Korean
		Premier's niece! We're hearing
		rumors they're gonna make a major
		issue out of what happened here...

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY

Carson and Walther come into the house. We hear only the
TICKING of the grandfather clock in the foyer.

Colonel Lee and his Officers stand by the stairs; Robbins,
Sabatini and Dave stand together near the front door.

				CARSON
		I'm not so sure what happened here.
		Something smells. Asshole was acting
		like he wanted us to spot him...



				WALTHER
		What the hell are you talking about?

				AMBASSADOR HAN (OS)
		Mr. Walther?

Ambassador Han comes down the stairs, his face tight with
repressed emotion.

				WALTHER
		Ambassador Han... my deepest --

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		-- I have no wish for condolences.
		Just answers.

				WALTHER
		As soon as we have any to give...

Suddenly, the Butler sprints across the foyer. He shoves the
cordless phone into Ambassador Han's hands.

Ambassador Han listens to the phone, then takes in a sharp
breath and sits on the steps.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(into phone)
		Yoon..?!

				CARSON
			(to FBI agents)
		Start a trace!

Carson is elated. Robbins, Sabatini and Dave rush out. Walther
pulls out a cell phone and hits a speed-dial key.

				WALTHER
			(into phone)
		Mr. Secretary... they're alive!

				COLONEL LEE
			(to Carson; incensed)
		You are tapping our phones?!

				CARSON
			(while crossing to
			Ambassador Han)
		Yeah, you didn't know. And I'm Meryl
		Streep.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

Javal is holding his cell phone next to Mrs. Han's face.



				MRS. HAN
			(into phone)
		We are not hurt. But this man is
		very serious --

He pulls the phone from her, takes a breath to compose himself.

				JAVAL
			(into phone)
		I want you to remember the feeling
		you had when you thought your family
		was dead, and use it to inform the
		choices you're about to make.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY

				CARSON
		Say you want to talk to the kids...

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(into phone)
		I need to know my children are all
		right.

				JAVAL (VO)
			(thru phone)
		Be in front of a television in two
		minutes. Tune it to channel four.
		You'll get the picture.

Javal hangs up. Stunned, Ambassador Han stands up.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		There is a television in my office.

As Carson, Ambassador Han, Colonel Lee and Walther hurry to
the office in the back of the house, Carson's radio crackles:

				ROBBINS (VO)
			(thru radio)
		We're screwed on the trace -- he's
		on a cell phone.

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Dave and Robbins watch Sabatini work the comm console.

				DAVE
		Play the tape back. I might be able
		to pull the electronic serial number
		out of the subcarrier.

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Ask Dave if he knows how to find the
		phone's serial number.

				ROBBINS
			(smiles; into radio)
		Hey, great idea...

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Ambassador Han turns on the TV to channel 4.

ANGLE ON TV

It's the same medical SOAP that's on at the apartment -- a
DOCTOR and NURSE are screwing in a deserted operating room.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

Javal is standing in the kitchenette, pointing a DIGITAL STILL
CAMERA at the family. It FLASHES as he takes a picture.

CLOSER

There is a cable running from Javal's computer to his cell
phone. He hooks another cable to the digital camera, and an
IMAGE appears on the screen of his laptop. He clicks on "SEND."

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Everyone stares expectantly at the TV. They turn as the fax
machine on the credenza RINGS. An IMAGE begins to emerge from
the machine: the picture from Javal's digital camera.

CLOSE ON FAXED PICTURE

It shows the Han family sitting in their booby-trapped chairs
in front of the TV. The explosives and the electronics are
clearly visible atop the set, as is the program on the TV.

				CARSON (OS)
		Oh, Jesus, those're explosives!
			(beat)
		Look at the TV -- this was just
		taken.

BACK TO SCENE

A second page on the fax begins to come through. As it does,
the telephone RINGS. Carson and Colonel Lee both go for the
extension near the sofa; Carson grabs it first. Ambassador Han
picks up the phone on his desk.



				JAVAL (VO)
			(thru phone)
		There must surely be several people
		in the room; you may put me on the
		speakerbox if you wish.

Ambassador Han clicks on the SPEAKERBOX. Carson and the others
look at the second faxed page: a list of instructions.

				JAVAL (VO)
			(continuing; thru
			speakerbox)
		I am not a terrorist. Your
		countries' political posturing means
		nothing to me. So do not waste time
		trying to negotiate.
			(beat)
		The Federal Reserve Bank of Los
		Angeles can furnish ten million
		dollars U.S. by 2:00 PM. The
		required denominations are in the
		instructions, as is the method of
		packaging. Be in your car at 3:00
		PM, and drive north on Highland
		Avenue. I will call with where to
		leave the money, which you will do
		at 3:30. If I am unmolested, I will
		call again at 4:00 with the family's
		location and the method for removing
		them from their... predicament.
		Could you please refer to page one?
			(they look at the photo)
		Any deviation from these instructions
		and my device will fulfill its
		function at exactly 5:00 PM.

CLICK. Ambassador Han looks around, feeling totally helpless.
Carson says nothing, trying not to show how uneasy he feels.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(to Walther)
		P'yÚngyang must approve the ransom...

				WALTHER
		Of course. The FBI's top Hostage
		Negotiator is on the way --

				CARSON
		-- Goddamn Negotiator's the last
		thing we need! This asshole sound
		like he was interested in bargaining?

Walther glares at Carson, then continues to Ambassador Han:


				WALTHER
		We have people who are experts in
		these situations. We really feel it
		would be best if you let them
		coordinate everything...

Numb, Ambassador Han nods.

				WALTHER
			(continuing; to Carson)
		Let's get on it...

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Robbins, Sabatini and Dave look up as Carson and Walther enter.

				CARSON
		...You're gonna just pay up, count
		on his good nature to return the
		family?!

				WALTHER
		It's the President's intention to
		keep this quiet, move forward with
		the Summit, and work with the North
		Koreans. Jesus, you've already
		embarrassed the shit out of us over
		the phone surveillance --

				CARSON
		-- They know their phones are tapped!
		They tap our fucking phones!

				WALTHER
		That's not the point! The point is
		not acknowledging it!
			(beat)
		We got an international incident
		brewing, with a country we were
		practically at war with last year!
		Our best Negotiator is gonna run
		point. If you got a problem, you can
		take the goddamn rest of the day off.

				CARSON
		This Consulate is my responsibility.

				WALTHER
		Not any more.

Carson is stunned. (OS), we hear a CHOPPER approaching.



				WALTHER
			(continuing)
		That's the Negotiator. You do the
		briefing.

Carson shoots a disgusted look at the others, then leaves.

							CUT TO:

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Carson turns off the Beach Boys SONG on the TV behind him.

Holding Javal's faxes, he's facing Ambassador Han, Colonel Lee
and the Hostage Negotiator (whom we don't yet see.)

				CARSON
		...Our worst enemy'll be the city.
		There are events gearing up all
		around town, and a dozen world
		leaders arriving. Add the Friday
		rush hour and usual L.A. bad
		behavior and it'll be a nightmare
		out there by 3 PM. It all works to
		the advantage of the kidnapper,
		hinders our pursuit efforts...
			(frowns)
		You don't agree?

WIDER


The Negotiator stands and takes the faxes from Carson.


It's Miranda, his wife. Her FBI shield-holder is folded over
the breast pocket of her jacket.

				MIRANDA
		I'm wondering whether to believe him
		when he says he's strictly motivated
		by money.

				CARSON
			(grabs faxes back)
		You see one word of Peoples'-
		Liberation, Holy-Jihad, Revolutionary
		whatever-it-is-we're-pissed-off-about-
		this-week bullshit in this entire
		letter?

				MIRANDA
		I still want to check the MO against
		known politicals, terrorists --



				CARSON
		-- Already doing it. We're
		coordinating with the Secret
		Service, the NSA and the CIA.

				MIRANDA
		Have someone talk to the LAPD, give
		them a cover story for the media
		about the crash on La Cienega.

Walther comes in and looks at Carson.

				WALTHER
		Why didn't you tell me Doctor Knoll
		is your wife?!

This surprises Ambassador Han and Colonel Lee.

				CARSON
			(while looking at Miranda)
		If she'd changed her name when we
		got married, I wouldn't have to.

				MIRANDA
			(to Carson)
		I'm so enjoying this opportunity to
		finally work together...

				WALTHER
		Jesus, forget I asked.
			(beat)
		The cash will be here in an hour.
			(to Miranda)
		Any thoughts on the kidnapper's
		thoughts?

				MIRANDA
		Everything indicates he's working
		alone. And his concerns do seem to
		be solely about the money... so I
		agree that he's only using the
		Summit and the tension with North
		Korea to create extreme motivation
		to pay the ransom.

				COLONEL LEE
		I will bring the money to him.

				CARSON
		My ass.

				COLONEL LEE
		The hostages are citizens of the
		People's Republic of Korea --

				CARSON
		-- Hey, do I go to the torture
		chambers in your prisons, tell you
		how to do your job?

				WALTHER
		All right, you're outta here! Is
		this the same insubordinate crap you
		pulled at Beverly Thrift?

Carson glares coldly at Walther.

				CARSON
		I'll coordinate the drop.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		Perhaps that is better. Inspector
		Carson knows the terrain --

				COLONEL LEE
		-- Then he can come with me.

Walther looks at Miranda. She nods her assent.

				WALTHER
			(firm; to Carson)
		It's settled.

				CARSON
		It sucks.

				MIRANDA
		But it means we can get on with it.

The Americans leave the room.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY

Still fuming, Carson walks ahead. Miranda pulls Walther aside.

				MIRANDA
			(sotto)
		Get one thing straight, Mr. Walther.
		If the Bureau had listened to Pete,
		Beverly Thrift never would've
		happened.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

Hands shaking with nerve- and speed-induced jitters, Javal
turns two switches on the unit atop the TV. Two LED readouts
light up: one shows the current time -- 2:30 PM -- the other
is fixed at 5:00 PM. Below, the TV is still on.

Javal flips the channels, stopping at a rerun of "Lifestyles
of the Rich and Famous." He suppresses a gleeful giggle.

				JAVAL
		That's more like it...

He checks the contents of his prescription bottle. Two pills.
He takes one, stuffs the bottle in his pocket, and leaves.

EXT.  PíY³NGYANG, NORTH KOREA - DAY

SUPER: PíyÚngyang. Capitol of North Korea.

Poster city for the charms of Communism: dreary, crumbling,
gray, stifling, hopeless.

INT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - CONFERENCE CHAMBER - DAY

In the main government offices, a meeting of ten overly-
decorated MILITARY MEN and their SUPPORT STAFFS.

Sour GENERAL KAI (50's) is ARGUING heatedly in KOREAN with an
aged MODERATE GENERAL. The weak-willed PREMIER OF NORTH KOREA
sits up front and listens passively.

An ARMY MAJOR sitting behind General Kai stands and slips out
the door.

EXT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - ROOFTOP - DAY

Crouched behind an air-conditioning unit, the Major, an
American Operative, speaks in UNACCENTED ENGLISH into a small
UPLINK DEVICE, disguised to look like a palmtop computer.

				OPERATIVE
			(into uplink device)
		...They've got the Premier agreeing
		to the hard-line position --

He hears footsteps approaching (OS).

				OPERATIVE
			(continuing; sotto)
		More to follow...

He angles skyward a tiny dish-shaped antenna on the Device. On
its screen it says COMPRESSING... SCRAMBLING... UPLINKING...

After it's finished, the Operative snaps it closed and puts it
into a false bottom in his attachÈ case. He disappears just
before a GUARD rounds the corner.

EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

"Welcome Pacific Partners" banners hang everywhere.

WORKERS and CATERERS prepare for the various parties and
events around town. COPS and PRIVATE SECURITY do their best to
keep traffic moving, but it's already getting congested.

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Dave stares at his computer, looking through a DATABASE of
kidnappers and their modus operandi. He rubs his eyes.

				DAVE
		I wanted to be home by now, take the
		kids to the rally in Boyle Heights.

				SABATINI
		We got a cabin in Big Bear. By now,
		L.A. was supposed to be a brown
		blotch in the rear-view mirror.

She's helping Walther stack packs of THOUSAND-DOLLAR-BILLS
into a series of small plastic bags, tying each one off when
it's the size of a brick. They then put the individual bags
into two larger bags.

Robbins rubber-bands a matchbook-sized HOMING TRANSMITTER in
between two packs of cash. He then hollows out a dime-sized
space inside a different pack of money with a razor knife.

He puts a tiny, SECOND homing transmitter in the space. Carson
checks some hand-held receivers. Miranda crosses to him.

				MIRANDA
		He'll expect a homing device --

				CARSON
		-- I expect him to expect it. He'll
		check the cash with an RF detector...
			(re larger transmitter)
		Meaning he'll find this one.
			(re smaller transmitter)
		This only has a quarter-mile range,
		but on a frequency too low to detect.
			(turns off receiver)
		And I doubt the asshole will have an
		X-ray machine or a metal detector.

				MIRANDA
		Why must you always refer generically
		to criminals as "assholes?"

				CARSON
		Gosh, you're right. It could
		undermine their self-esteem and spoil
		their chances for rehabilitation.

	
				MIRANDA
		You been reading my magazines in the
		bathroom again?

She returns to listening to an AUDIO TAPE:

				JAVAL (VO)
			(thru recorder)
		"And my device will fulfill its
		function at exactly 5:00 PM..."

				MIRANDA
		He's really exhibiting pressured
		speech... big effort here to sound
		calm. Same with his vocabulary... if
		he were in control, he wouldn't feel
		such a need to sound that way.

				CARSON
		Just tell me if we can use it.

				MIRANDA
		If we needle him he could get sloppy
		and give us an opening, but I'm not
		going to risk it. This is the worst
		kind of perpetrator: anything makes
		him deviate from his carefully-
		scripted plan, he could become
		extremely volatile.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

During this, Colonel Lee stands in a window on the top floor,
pointing a LASER EAVESDROPPING UNIT at the FBI guardhouse.

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru headphones)
		Do we have back-up if the bleeper
		fails?

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru headphones)
		Nothing but physical surveillance.

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

				MIRANDA
		It's real important we don't lose
		him. He didn't go through all the
		trouble of designing that bomb not
		to use it.

Carson looks at her as the thought of it hits him.



				CARSON
		Well, it ain't gonna happen.
			(beat; sotto)
		Not again...

EXT.  WHITE HOUSE, WASHINGTON, DC - ESTABLISHING - DAY

INT.  WHITE HOUSE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

The National Security Council: VICE PRESIDENT, SECRETARIES OF
DEFENSE, STATE, CHIEFS of the FBI, CIA and NSA -- sit
nervously around a table, facing a video conferencing setup.
The President, in Air Force One, APPEARS on it.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		What the hell is the big crisis?

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		We just received a missive from the
		North Korean attachÈ. They say the
		kidnapping is a U.S. plot to provoke
		and humiliate them during the Summit.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		Bullshit. They're just ticked because
		we don't want the Chinese dragging
		their asses into the treaty talks.

The SENIOR INTELLIGENCE OFFICER refers to his notes.

				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
		We have a covert operative in place.
		He reports the hard-liners and
		moderates in the High Command are
		arguing about how to respond, should
		the Premier's niece and her children
		should be killed.

				PRESIDENT
			(scowls; thru video link)
		Respond?! Christ. What about the
		damn Premier?

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		He's weak. He has to look tough to
		save face, keep control of hard-
		liners... otherwise he risks a coup.

				CIA CHIEF
		Which is a real possibility. Most of
		those old-fart Generals don't want to
				-more-

				CIA CHIEF (Cont'd)
		be part of the Summit any more than
		we want them to. They're mad as hell
		he even talked to the Chinese.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		I don't want to deal with this right
		now! Get our diplomats on it. Tell
		the North we'll pay the ransom for
		'em... Placate 'em! And make damn
		sure we get that family back in one
		piece. Who's in charge in L.A.?

				FBI CHIEF
		The Bureau, Sir. We have a crack
		team in place.

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		There's a Diplomatic Liaison from
		State, too.

				CIA CHIEF
			(to FBI Chief)
		What about your man stationed at the
		Consulate...
			(refers to notes)
		Carson? He was demoted from the FBI
		Hostage Program, couple years back.
		And this did happen on his watch...

				FBI CHIEF
			(irritated)
		There's no way he could've prevented
		this abduction! Besides, I've got one
		of my top Negotiators in charge --

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		-- Whatever. I want a total news
		blackout and I want this over with,
		quickly! Without giving those Commie
		little bastards any excuse to shit
		all over my Summit!

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Inside, the grandfather clock in the foyer CHIMES THREE TIMES.

Colonel Lee, carrying an AMD-74 machine gun, goes to get in the
driver's side of the second armored Mercedes, but Carson is
already there. Grumbling, he crosses to the passenger's side.

Carson drives off just a moment before Colonel Lee is
completely in the car.



EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY

The Mercedes crosses Melrose, going into Hollywood. The town
is all done up with posters and banners.

Robbins and Walther follow a block behind the Mercedes in an
unmarked car; Sabatini and Dave drive ahead in Dave's Dodge.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Miranda, Ambassador Han, and Lisa's father (the cussing Jag
Owner) wait by the phone. Miranda smiles reassuringly at the
two nervous fathers. The phone RINGS; she picks it up.

				MIRANDA
			(into phone)
		Yes, please go ahead...

				JAVAL (VO)
			(long beat; thru phone)
		Ah... this must be one of those
		professionals --

				MIRANDA
			(into phone)
		-- I'm only here to see that
		everyone gets what they want --

				JAVAL (VO)
			(thru phone)
		-- I've got my shotgun in little
		Lisa's mouth, and I will pull the
		trigger in five seconds unless you
		put the Ambassador on the phone.

Miranda hands the phone to Ambassador Han.

INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

From the two-way radio in Carson's pocket:

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru radio)
		The drop is at the DeMille barn,
		across from the Hollywood Bowl.
		You're to leave the money in the
		center of the parking lot.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Shit... no way we can set up a stake-
		out in...
				-more-

				CARSON (Cont'd)
			(checks watch)
		Four minutes. Call the Park Rangers
		at the Bowl. Have them clear the
		area of civilians.

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Remember, Pete... we're dealing with
		a customer with a lot of rage.

				CARSON
			(to himself)
		Must've bought a house same time we
		did.

EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

Robbins and Walther are inching along in traffic on Highland
near Hollywood Blvd.

Elsewhere, we see unmarked police and government cars cruising
around, dropping off disguised FOOT-SURVEILLANCE OFFICERS, etc.

A BIKER CLUB

of twenty aging, weekend-warriors, all on custom Harleys, turn
from the Boulevard onto Highland.

EXT.  DEMILLE BARN - DAY

Carson drives the Mercedes into the entrance of the Hollywood
Museum Park. Carson stops in front of a yellow barn with a
sign atop it: "Jesse Lasky Famous Players."

INT./EXT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

Still disguised as an ice-cream truck, the van is parked
across Highland by the entrance to the Hollywood Bowl, where a
Summit-related concert is being readied.

Javal watches the Mercedes, and takes his last pill. He's flying.

INT.  MERCEDES - DAY

Colonel Lee grabs the two large plastic bags full of money
from the back seat, opens his door, and drops them onto the
pavement. Carson looks around.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		There's about a hundred ways he can
		scurry off like a cockroach from
		here... So spread out.

Colonel Lee checks their BEEPING homing receiver. Carson hangs
a left onto Highland, going back the way he came.

INT.  DAVE'S DODGE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Dave holds their homing receiver. Sabatini, behind the wheel,
smacks his arm and points ahead:

EXT.  DEMILLE BARN - DAY

Javal's van drives into the parking lot, and stops right above
the bags of money.

				DAVE
			(into radio)
		Our boy's in a fuckin' ice cream
		truck!

EXT.  ODIN STREET - DAY

Sabatini and Dave watch Javal's van through the trees.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

Javal, sweating and shaking, quickly runs a metal-detector
wand over each of the individual bags of money. One of them
makes the speaker in the wand handle WHINE.

INT.  DAVE'S DODGE - INCLUDE POV OF DEMILLE BARN - DAY

The van pulls away.

Dave glances at the homing receiver. The signal isn't moving.
He looks up...

Two of the small bags of money are sitting on the pavement.

				DAVE
		Son of a bitch!
			(into radio)
		He found the bleepers -- both of
		them!

INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Fuck! Okay, stay back. It's not like
		he'll be hard to see in that truck.
		Which way's he heading?

				DAVE (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Toward the freeway.

Carson hangs a U-turn.



EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY

At the complex intersection where Highland ends at the 101,
Javal bears to the right, toward the South on-ramp.

Sabatini and Dave follow a few cars behind as he gets on it.

Suddenly, he scoots over to the shoulder and slams the van
into REVERSE. He backs off the on-ramp, past a row of angry
drivers, passing by Sabatini and Dave.

Peeling in reverse onto Highland, Javal stomps on the brakes.
The snap buckles holding the ice-cream-truck superstructure
around his van BREAK APART, and the whole thing slides off...
blocking Sabatini's way.

Javal drives forward again, this time getting onto the 101
North on-ramp.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Miranda looks at Ambassador Han and Lisa's father while
anxiously clutching her two-way radio.

				MIRANDA
			(into radio)
		What happened?

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru radio)
		We're made! Gotta grab him!

				MIRANDA
			(beat; into radio)
		All right... Carefully...

INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson follows Javal onto the freeway. Colonel Lee grabs his
AMD-74 machine gun.

				CARSON
		Watch it! We need him alive!

EXT.  HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - DAY

Colonel Lee leans out and SHOOTS Javal's rear tires out.

The van drives erratically, held in its lane by bumping
against the cars around it.

Carson pulls up closer...

Suddenly, the rear doors of the van burst open...

And Javal flies out, riding a motorcycle. He's got the money
stuffed into two big, chaps-sized SADDLEBAGS slung over the
back of the machine.

He straddles the lanes, going against traffic, riding like a
maniac back the way he came.

Carson watches him in the rear-view... and speeds up, driving
away from him.

				COLONEL LEE
		Turn around!

But Carson hugs the shoulder, moving through the heavy
traffic, until he spots what he was looking for:

The Biker Club, riding in formation up ahead.

Carson cuts in front of them and slams on the brakes. He jumps
out and grabs one of the Biker's machines by the handlebars,
wrestling it to a stop. While pulling its BURLY OWNER off it:

				CARSON
		FBI. Call our office, they'll take
		care of you.

Meanwhile, the other BIKERS have come to help their friend.
They pull guns, knives, chains...

They're stopped by Sabatini, who appears holding her MP-5
machine pistol. The Biker yells at Carson as he drives way:

				BIKER
		I'm a taxpayer! I'm a goddamn
		dentist!

COLONEL LEE

gets in the driver's seat of the Mercedes and turns it around.

JAVAL

continues down the freeway on his bike, straddling lanes,
driving the wrong way, retracing his route back to Highland,
leaving CAR HORNS, CURSING, and COLLISIONS in his wake.

WIDER

When everyone thinks they've seen it all, here comes another
mad biker -- Carson -- riding against traffic in pursuit.



EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY

Javal rides against traffic down the Cahuenga on-ramp, then
jumps the divider, runs the light crossing Highland, and gets
into the southbound lanes.

He just misses a BUS, nearly wiping out.

				CARSON
		Just don't kill yourself, you piece
		of shit...

Carson fishes out his two-way.

				CARSON
			(continuing; into radio)
		Helicopter or two would be nice!

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Listening to the two-way, Miranda tries to follow the action.

				MIRANDA
			(into radio)
		Love to be in the loop on this...

EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY

Speeding up, Carson precariously cuts in between traffic.

				CARSON
			(to himself)
		Not just now, dear...

Seeing Carson approaching on his right, Javal pulls his Benelli
shotgun from one of the saddlebags. He rests the barrel on his
arm and FIRES a blinding-white load of magnesium at Carson.

Carson grabs the brake handles to slow down, and the BLAST
crosses just in front of him. A few BURNING pieces pepper the
front fender of the bike, but the bulk HITS the concrete art-
deco statue in the entrance to the Hollywood Bowl. The statue
shatters into a million FLAMING fragments.

				CARSON
			(continuing; grumbling)
		I coulda had a ranch... maybe some
		horses... but no, we moved to L.A.

JAVAL

speeds up. A car passing on the right BUMPS him. Javal grabs
for the handlebar to stabilize himself, DROPPING the shotgun.

A HELICOPTER appears, and flies just above him.

Then, spotting some police cars ahead, he quickly hangs a
right, ducking onto Alta Loma Terrace.

EXT.  ALTA LOMA TERRACE - DAY

Carson stops at the entrance to the winding, hillside
neighborhood, accessible only by footpaths. The area is
covered by thick foliage, hiding Javal from the helicopter.

Carson revs down so he can listen for Javal's machine. He
HEARS it up above and takes off, up a steep flight of stairs.

NEW ANGLE

Javal has reached the summit, only to find he's boxed in. He
can either turn around, or take the neighborhood's unique,
outdoor elevator, housed in a free-standing, three-story
concrete tower.

He jumps off his bike. Carrying the saddlebags, he runs into
the elevator -- but it needs a key to operate.

Javal comes back out, panicking.  He HEARS Carson coming up
the hill. He spots a GARDENER watering nearby with a hose.

ANGLE WITH CARSON

as he reaches the summit. He sees Javal's motorcycle,
abandoned, lying on its side...

And then he sees the Gardener, sprawled on the ground, a
BULLET HOLE in the center of his forehead.

Carson turns off his motorcycle and pulls out his Sig 9mm. He
moves slowly toward the elevator tower and looks inside.

HIS POV

The casement window in the back of the tower is broken. One end
of the gardener's hose is tied to a grate, and the hose is
hanging through the broken window.

Carson looks out the window as Javal climbs down the outside of
the tower on the hose to High Tower Drive, the street below.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		He's on foot, at the base of the
		elevator tower!

But just as Carson is about to climb down the hose...



EXT.  HIGH TOWER DRIVE - DAY

Javal spots a COLLEGE GIRL backing a tiny Geo out of her
garage. He rips her out of the car, jumps in and tears away.

EXT.  ALTA LOMA TERRACE - DAY

Carson jumps back on his motorcycle and starts it up.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Goddammit! He's in a blue Geo!

EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY

In the Geo, Javal drives out onto Highland. He muscles his way
through traffic, then cuts across to Franklin.

Behind him, Robbins and Walther drive along the divider lane.

On the bike, Carson emerges from Alta Loma, joining Sabatini
and Dave in Dave's Dodge and Colonel Lee in the Mercedes as
they all try to catch up to Javal.

The helicopter flies ahead, then disappears past the hill
below Franklin.

EXT.  VINE STREET - DAY

Javal hangs a hard right off of Franklin onto Vine, putting
him on top of a hill that drops down to Sunset.

Carson and Colonel Lee close in on the Geo.

Suddenly, the helicopter RISES UP from the bottom of the hill.
It's less than fifty feet in front of Javal, at eye level.

Javal FIRES at the copter with his Beretta.

Colonel Lee indiscriminately FIRES his machine gun at the Geo.

Carson SHOUTS at Colonel Lee, furious at his carelessness!

INT.  PURSUIT COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Colonel Lee's BULLETS trace across the cockpit of the
helicopter; one hits the PILOT in the neck. Clutching it with
one hand, the Pilot loses control of the copter.

EXT.  VINE STREET - DAY

Everyone on the road scatters to get out of the copter's way.
It appears as though it's going to crash onto the street, then
it gains altitude, GYRATING wildly just above the Geo.

Javal tries to move away, but one of its landing runners
SMASHES through the top of the windshield, WEDGING itself
against the inside of the Geo's roof.

Snared, the little Geo is LIFTED off the ground -- instantly
too high for a terrified Javal to escape from it.

INT.  PURSUIT COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

The wounded Pilot, barely conscious, searches for safe area to
set down -- but there are cars and people everywhere.

The Pilot wrestles his stick; his copter is almost impossible
to control with the car hanging from it. He's fading...

EXT.  VINE STREET - DAY

The copter and Geo lurch over and past the round Capitol
Records building, KNOCKING the spindle off the top of it.

The impact further destabilizes the copter's flight. It's
heading right toward the 20-story Sunset Vine Tower, at the
bottom of the hill.

INT.  JAVAL'S GEO - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Javal, trapped inside, looks through the windshield as the
glass and steel side of the tower looms closer. He SCREAMS.

EXT.  SUNSET VINE TOWER - DAY

The copter and the Geo CRASH into the side of the Tower, 12
floors up. Glass blows out in all directions; the rotor
shatters; office furnishings are blown through the hole like
backwash.

The Geo hangs passenger's side down from the runner.

CLOSER

From the series of jerking, slipping MOVEMENTS, it is clear
the copter is not going to stay where it is for long.

The Geo's passenger side door pops open. Javal, panting with
fear, jimmies his foot against the dashboard and holds the
steering wheel to keep from falling out.

ANGLE ON VEHICLES BELOW

In the clog of traffic, cars swerve away, rapidly reverse...
anything to get away from the area below the impact.



JAVAL

reacts to another SLIP. The big saddlebags of money on the
seat start to slide toward the open door.

He gingerly reaches over to grab them... the copter SHIFTS
again... he loses his grip...

And, clutching the saddlebags, he TOPPLES out of the car.

We stay with him as he FALLS 12 stories, SCREAMING...

Then LANDING on top of a parking meter. It RIPS though his
chest and he hits the sidewalk with a wet THUD.

EXT.  VINE AND SUNSET - DAY

Carson rushes across the street to Javal's body. The teetering
copter and Geo are right above it.

Grimacing, Carson tries to lift Javal's body up off the
parking meter, but it's messy, slippery work...

Unable to move the body, Carson quickly searches its pockets.
All he finds is the now-empty prescription bottle.

Above, the copter GROANS... it's about to come loose...

Carson pulls out his Sig 9mm and FIRES several times at
Javal's right wrist, then TEARS the HAND off the body.

With a loud WRENCHING of metal, the copter and Geo break away
from the building.

Carson grabs the saddlebags and runs like hell across the
street, diving for cover behind a car.

BEHIND CARSON

the copter and Geo crash to the sidewalk and EXPLODE.

NEW ANGLE

Sooty, covered in Javal's blood, Carson crosses to the others.
He throws Walther the saddlebags and Sabatini the severed hand.

				CARSON
		Fingerprint it.
			(to Walther)
		He's not gonna tell us where to find
		the hostages...
				-more-

				CARSON (Cont'd)
			(looks at watch)
		Meaning we got exactly 80 minutes to
		figure it out for ourselves.

				WALTHER
		Figure it out?! With what?!

				CARSON
			(ignores him; into radio)
		Miranda! We need a copter, pronto!
			(to Robbins)
		Get back to his van. There were no
		plates, but check the VIN, look it
		over, then meet us at the Consulate.

Robbins is still trying to process what just happened.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		Go!

							CUT TO:

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

The clock reads 3:50 PM. Carson, Miranda, Robbins, Sabatini,
Ambassador Han and Colonel Lee are all TALKING at once.

				CARSON
			(to Walther)
		...Scrounge us some bodies: National
		Guard, State Troopers, CHPs, local
		PD's, meter maids --

				WALTHER
		-- They're gonna search the whole
		city in a goddamn hour..?!

				CARSON
		Look, I don't need you to tell me
		how fucked we are!

				WALTHER
		Fuck you!! Every time you're on a
		case something explodes!

Carson looks like he's going to explode. Before he can reply:

				MIRANDA
		Stop! The clock's running! Arguing
		is a luxury we can't afford!
				-more-

				MIRANDA (Cont'd)
			(looks at Carson)
		What's done is done. There'll be
		plenty of time to point fingers
		later.

Carson would love to get into it, but he lets it slide. He
looks Sabatini, wandering aimlessly with Javal's severed hand.

				SABATINI
		I need some fuckin' ink!!

Carson grabs one of the expensive pens from Ambassador Han's
desk, SNAPS it in half, and hands it to her.

In the b.g. she stands at the credenza, inks the hand's fingers
and thumb and rolls them onto a piece of letterhead paper.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		This is impossible! How can you even
		begin to find them?

Good question. All eyes go to Miranda.

				MIRANDA
		Well, the normal procedure is to
		negotiate with the perpetrator...

Her head is spinning. She looks at Carson.

				CARSON
		Let's take stock. We've got a picture
		of where he hid the family, and
		recordings of his calls --

				MIRANDA
		-- That's right! We can send them to
		our experts for analysis...

				CARSON
			(to Ambassador Han)
		Same with his fingerprints. But that
		means we need high-quality image and
		data transmission. We can piss away
		ten minutes coptering this shit to
		our offices in Westwood, or we can
		use your surveillance equipment.

				COLONEL LEE
		There is no surveillance equipment.
		This is a diplomatic facility --

				CARSON
		-- You want to play games, fine.

He turns to go. Ambassador Han turns to Colonel Lee.



				AMBASSADOR HAN
		Take them upstairs.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

In the converted attic, several North Korean ESPIONAGE AGENTS
monitor military and police frequencies, downlinks from remote
wiretaps and surveillance units; short-wave, cellular, etc.
Their equipment, being of Chinese and Iranian manufacture, is
hardly cutting-edge technology.

Colonel Lee and Ambassador Han enter. The Espionage Agents are
surprised when Carson, Miranda, Walther and Sabatini follow.
Walther looks around, amazed. Carson grabs a pair of headphones.

				CARSON
		South Korean Consulate's just down
		the street -- want to take a listen?

Colonel Lee pulls the phones away from him.

Carson takes the page with the fingerprints from Sabatini. The
Espionage Agents back away from her and Javal's hand.

				CARSON
			(continuing; re hand)
		Shitcan that thing, will you?!

She looks around. Then, shrugging, she tosses it into a
wastepaper basket.

				CARSON
			(continuing; to Colonel Lee)
		Got a digital scanner?

				COLONEL LEE
		Analog.

				CARSON
			(looks equipment over)
		You might want to drop a few bucks at
		Radio Shack and get with the decade.
			(into radio)
		Dave -- get in here. Bring your
		computer, a city map, and the tapes
		of the ransom calls.

				DAVE (VO)
			(thru radio)
		On my way...

He's also HEARD, faintly, through the laser eavesdropping unit
by the window. Carson notices, but doesn't comment.



				MIRANDA
			(to Colonel Lee)
		Colonel, you saw the perp. Describe
		him to the Ambassador, see if it's
		anyone he knows.

Colonel Lee begrudgingly obliges. Carson dials a phone.

				CARSON
			(into phone)
		This is Carson in L.A. There's a set
		of prints coming over. Narrow the
		search criteria: Male, thirties,
		Caucasian... French, Belgian, Swiss,
		maybe Canadian. Try kidnappers and
		bombers first. We need an answer in
		fifteen minutes.

EXT.  HOOVER BUILDING, WASHINGTON, DC - DAY

FBI headquarters, with the Washington Monument in the b.g.

INT.  HOOVER BUILDING - FINGERPRINT LAB - DAY

A TECHNICIAN, wearing thick glasses, sits in front of a high-
resolution computer monitor.

				FINGERPRINT TECH
			(into phone)
		That yellow air out there finally
		rot your brain?! It's impossible!

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru phone)
		Dazzle me.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Carson clicks off the phone, then, as he dials another number:

				CARSON
			(to Walther)
		We got one of the best sound guys
		right here in town...
			(into phone)
		Newman in Audio Analysis...

				DAVE (OS)
		Newman's gone.

WIDER

Dave comes into the room.



				DAVE
		He quit, couple weeks ago. Opened a
		bed and breakfast in Wyoming.

Carson looks at Miranda and hangs up the phone.

				DAVE
			(continuing; looks around)
		Damn... they get HBO? I'd sure like
		to see the fight tonight.

				CARSON
		Get those tapes transferred to a
		sound guy. We need ambient and
		background analysis, the whole
		enchilada.

				DAVE
		Enchilada -- you saying that because
		I'm Mexican?

				CARSON
		No... 'cause you're fat.

				MIRANDA
			(picks up Javal's fax)
		Photo enhancement... Isn't there
		some amazing tech with the LAPD --

				DAVE
		-- Bronsky. Transferred to Seattle
		PD a month ago.

				CARSON
		Jesus H. Christ...

				SABATINI
		I'd send it to Langley. Let the CIA
		earn their keep.

				CARSON
		Do it.

Carson tosses Javal's bloody, unlabeled prescription bottle to
Miranda. She looks it over, runs her finger inside, tastes the
dust on her fingertip.

				MIRANDA
		Given his behavior, this orange
		residue... I'd say Desoxyn, 25 mg.
		Amphetamines.

				CARSON
		Any significance?



				MIRANDA
		It's consistent with the lone wolf
		scenario: A handful of these is pure
		bravery-in-a-bottle, 'til the
		psychosis and paranoia kick in.
			(beat)
		We could check pharmacy records, on
		the remote chance he got them
		legally... if we had a couple of
		weeks, that is.

				CARSON
			(to Sabatini)
		Get the Bureau on it.

				MIRANDA
		Forget it. It's a waste of manpower.

				CARSON
		Look, goddammit, you start skipping
		no-chance-in-hell leads, we can all
		quit and go to the beach right now.

Sabatini looks at them -- which will it be? Miranda frowns and
nods her okay, then spreads the L.A. map out on the table.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		He grabbed the family at 8:30. The
		last certain visual we had was just
		before his van went into the alley
		on La Cienega at 8:42. He called the
		Consulate at 9:30.

				MIRANDA
		That gives him about fifty minutes
		to get to his location, move and
		secure the hostages, and activate
		his time bomb.

				CARSON
		He probably waited a while to pad
		the time -- he wanted us know the
		family was still alive...
			(sotto; re Koreans)
		...So these crazy bastards wouldn't
		throw a premature shit hemorrhage,
		but he didn't want to call too soon,
		either. I say they're within 15 to
		20 minutes, via surface streets, of
		where we last saw them.

He draws a circle on the city map: Beverly Hills to downtown,
Hollywood to Inglewood.



				MIRANDA
		The most densely-populated part of
		the L.A. basin. This narrows it down
		to about 200,000 dwellings.

A beat while this sinks in.

				MIRANDA
			(continuing)
		He was traveling west --

				CARSON
		-- Bet he doubled back.

				MIRANDA
		C'mon, that's total conjecture --

				SABATINI
			(re Carson)
		-- I'd trust his instincts when
		dealing with maniacs. He is deeply
		disturbed.

				MIRANDA
		You're telling me?

INT.  WHITE HOUSE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Everyone is smoking. Their tension has increased tenfold since
we last saw them. The President, SEEN through the video setup,
is pacing on Air Force One.

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		...North Koreans have gone ballistic,
		accusing us of botching the ransom
		drop on purpose.

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		They're still harping on that
		"American plot" nonsense.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		Meaning?

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		They say the death of the Premier's
		niece and her family would justify
		immediate retaliation.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		Are they out of their fuckin' minds?!
		What kind of retaliation?

Everyone in the room looks at one another.



				CIA CHIEF
		They're threatening to pull a Saddam
		Hussein: remember the Scuds he lobbed
		at Jerusalem during Desert Storm?
			(beat)
		They're talking about firing a
		missile into Los Angeles --

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		-- A goddamn WHAT??

				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
		Best guess is an AS-15, medium-range
		cruise -- their version of our
		Tomahawk, launched from offshore.

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		The AS-15 is gyro-guided. It will
		find the city, but it's not too
		accurate beyond that.

				VICE PRESIDENT
		Still, for their purposes it's
		perfect: Hit somewhere in L.A., take
		out a city block or two...

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		To the eyes of the world it's a
		measured response -- like what Reagan
		did to Qaddafi. But actually striking
		at an American city would be a huge
		psychological victory for them.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		I don't believe I'm hearing this!
			(beat)
		So if we know it's coming, we can
		knock it out of the fuckin' sky!

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		These weapons fly subsonically, below
		radar... we don't have the defenses
		in place... If we'd had the time to
		deploy a string of Patriot anti-
		missile batteries across the coast --

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		-- You're saying we got all this
		lousy hardware and can't stop one
		goddamn missile??

Everyone's silence answers his question.



				PRESIDENT
			(continuing; thru video
			link)
		I want an immediate search for all
		ships within range.

				FBI CHIEF
		We better inform the other leaders,
		stall on the Summit --

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		There's no reason to panic yet --
		they can't launch until after the
		family's confirmed dead!

				CIA CHIEF
		Afraid that's not the case...

The Intelligence Officer illustrates his explanation with
FOOTAGE and DIAGRAMS on a nearby COMPUTER SCREEN:

				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
		The North Korean Premier holds what
		we call a "Brinksman Switch." He's
		able to destroy a missile in flight,
		right up to the moment before it
		achieves its target.

				CIA CHIEF
		Our Op says they've timed their
		retaliation to hit right after 5:00.

				FBI CHIEF
		And if the family turns up okay,
		they'll just make it self-destruct.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		Shit! I really don't need this today!

				VICE PRESIDENT
		We're forgetting one thing here: the
		family. Intelligence is sure the
		North will abort their attack if Mrs.
		Han and her kids are safely returned?

				CIA CHIEF
		Absolutely. Their whole game depends
		on claiming a legitimate provocation.

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		Still, we should let them know there'd
		be a response... if it comes to it.



				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		I'd like to turn 'em into a
		radioactive parking lot.

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		That's the problem: we can't. We're
		the last superpower. Our hands are
		tied by politics, alliances, goddamn
		stacks of treaties... most we could
		do is give 'em a "measured response"
		back again, or everyone starts
		crying that we're the bullies.

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		Damn, I miss the Cold War. Russians
		wouldn't have dreamt of pulling a
		stunt like this.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		Believe me, the North drops one in
		my fuckin' city, I'm dropping ten in
		theirs. Get some bombers in the air.
		And don't tell me any more bad news!

		Who's got those kinds of skills:

				DAVE
		Military. Cop, maybe. Shit, your

		Keep... the sun... to my left!!

The Cameraman and the Pilot sigh at each other.

		Nada. Total news blackout.

				BOBBI
		Go back over the hill.

		We got the valley traffic report in

She takes an industrial-sized bottle of Mylanta out of her

takes a huge swig and grimaces.

EXT.  PACIFIC OCEAN - ANGLE ON FISHING TRAWLER - DAY

SUPER: Pacific Ocean. 500 miles west-northwest of Los Angeles.

We FIND a nondescript commercial fishing vessel. Up top, some
Asian "FISHERMEN" crank in and stow their nets.



INT./EXT.  FISHING TRAWLER - DAY

Coming closer, we see it's actually a disguised North Korean
SPY VESSEL. Several MEN, working under hanging tarps, secure
a 20-foot-long missile launching track to the bow.

Two MISSILE EXPERTS install a green, cone-shaped WARHEAD of
high explosives onto the nose of a 23-foot-long, short-winged
CRUISE MISSILE. They wait for the CAPTAIN's orders...

		Jump a copter to the Consulate. See

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

At the kidnapping site, the intersection is blocked off with
yellow police tape. Several LAPD cruisers are parked nearby.
Some COPS are interviewing the Carpool Lady.

Despite this, the neighborhood's bazaar -- a sidewalk sale
with MUSIC, food vendors, etc. -- has half-heartedly begun.

The government helicopter HOVERS and Carson helps Miranda climb
down a long chain ladder. Colonel Lee follows impatiently.

NEW ANGLE

Carson uncovers the bodies of the Driver and the Motorist,
lying on the sidewalk. He grimaces. Colonel Lee does not.
Miranda wants to look, but Carson drops the cover. She picks
it up, then turns away in horror.

A young BLACK COP crosses to them. He's holding a plastic bag
with a spent shotgun shell in it.

				YOUNG COP
		Inspector! Look at this...
			(reads from shell)
		"Dragon's Breath..?"



				CARSON
		Twelve-gauge shell filled with
		magnesium and ignition powder. Shit's
		worse than napalm -- Geneva
		Convention outlawed it for warfare.

				MIRANDA
		Then how did he get it?

				CARSON
		Easy -- you can buy 'em mail order.

		Where's the Consulate's car?

				YOUNG COP

		Uh... apparently it was stolen...

		Shut up!

		You'd be surprised...

		I hate this fuckin' town.

INT./EXT.  FISHING TRAWLER - PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY

The North Korean COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER puts down his
headphones and hurries on deck to the Captain. It's time.

Suddenly, a BEARDED CREWMAN crosses to the Captain. He calmly
SHOOTS him and the FIRST MATE.

The rest of the Crew is shocked. Holding his pistol on the
Crew, the Bearded Crewman nods at the Missile Experts.
Saluting, they remove the green warhead from the missile.

Two OTHER CONSPIRATORS, carrying a metal locker, appear from
below deck. The Crew murmurs nervously as they remove from the
locker a red warhead and attach it to the missile.

Finishing, one of the Experts pushes the firing trigger and
the missile WHOOSHES from its launching pad.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

The government helicopter touches down behind the Consulate.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Ambassador Han, Walther and Sabatini are looking at a series
of high-definition faxes spread out on a table.

Carson, Miranda and Colonel Lee hurry back in. Disgusted,
Carson throws his jacket on a chair.

				CARSON
		Wasted trip: Witnesses say he was
		working alone, and he was a vicious
		son of a bitch. Old news.

				COLONEL LEE
			(to Ambassador Han)
		And our car was stolen.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		I felt safer when I was the
		Ambassador to Libya.

				SABATINI
		Image enhancements came back.

POV OF PICTURES

The CIA technicians have enlarged and enhanced every part of
the fax deemed significant, in individual blowups.

BACK TO SCENE

Colonel Lee is standing right beside Carson, leaning over to
look at the pictures. Carson looks at him, irritated.

				CARSON
		We going steady?



				SABATINI
		The sun position tells us the
		windows are facing northeast.
			(beat)
		Here's the best -- look at the glass
		on the prints hanging in the
		background. There's a reflection of
		a reflection, out on the street: the
		corner of a billboard.

				CARSON
		Looks like the wheel of a car.

				MIRANDA
		We talked about these billboards,
		when we were car shopping! Four-
		door... they make a wagon, too.
			(beat)
		Something Japanese... God, what was
		it? Toyota... Mazda... Honda... You
		thought it had no character.

				CARSON
		I thought that about all of them.
		C'mon, think, dammit!!

				MIRANDA
		You think!! You were there, too!

They're stumped, and bitterly frustrated. To Sabatini:

				CARSON
		Call the outdoor advertising
		companies. Get the location of all
		the billboards for Japanese cars
		within our search parameters.

Meanwhile, Dave and Robbins are calling car alarm shops:

INT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - GENERAL KAI'S OFFICE - DAY

General Kai stands in hushed conversation with the Army Major
Operative and another trusted AIDE. The PHONE buzzes; the
others leave the room before General Kai picks it up.



INT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - OPERATIVE'S OFFICE - DAY

Behind closed doors, the Operative LISTENS to the phone call
with an EAVESDROPPING RECEIVER. What he hears stuns him.

							CUT TO:

EXT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - ROOFTOP - DAY

The Operative is in his hiding spot with his uplink device.

				OPERATIVE
			(urgently; into device)
		...Missile heading to L.A. has a

A GUNSHOT rings out (OS), and the Operative's chest EXPLODES
in blood. He pitches forward... but presses the "transmit"
button on the uplink device before dying.

On screen it says UPLINKING... (without scrambling)... then
another GUNSHOT destroys it.

Angry, General Kai steps INTO FRAME and kicks the Operative
over with his foot.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - LOS ANGELES - DAY

Mrs. Han and Joy sit motionless. Sam, on the other hand, is
trying not to squirm. Mrs. Han looks at him, angry.

				MRS. HAN
		He asked you if you had to go...

The family becomes aware of a shrill SOUND, (OS), distant at
first, but growing increasingly louder... The sound-level
meters all begin to creep upward...

EXT.  APARTMENT BUILDING - CLOSE - DAY

A team of GARDENERS has arrived on the property for their
weekly mow, blow, and go. They have lawnmowers, edgers, blowers
-- it's as NOISY as an aircraft carrier during takeoffs.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

The SOUND is getting louder, and louder...

				JOY
		Oh, my God...

The meters are hovering just below the red...



SAM

pivots his head and looks at the tiny microphone, no bigger
than a pencil eraser, attached neatly to the headrest.

He begins chewing his wad of GUM... leans in toward the
microphone, his head obscuring what he's doing...

He moves back and we see he's SEALED the front of the mic with
a small piece of the gum.

And his meter drops to zero.

WIDER

Sam tilts his head forward and bends his wrist upward so he
can get the rest of the gum out of his mouth. Then, while
keeping pressure on the armrest with his elbow, he moves his
hand over to Mrs. Han. They can't quite reach each other...

He FLICKS the piece of gum and she catches it.

Meanwhile, the NOISE increases. The two meters peak into the
red... the yellow WARNING LIGHT begins to flash...

Mrs. Han quickly puts the gum in her mouth, bites it in half,
and cautiously passes the remainder over to Joy.

Joy puts the gum in her mouth. She tries to push it over her
mic, but her hair is in the way. She shakes her head; some
hair strands remain, but she covers the mic just as the
Gardeners' noise reaches a CRESCENDO...

All three sound meters sit pinned to zero. The yellow light
stops flashing.

Sam, sweating, looks at his mother and sister... and starts
laughing. They join him: a celebration for a small victory.

INT.  WHITE HOUSE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DUSK

The clock on the wall reads 7:13, eastern time. The President,
still on Air Force One, APPEARS on the VIDEO LINK. Cut the
tension in the room with a knife? You'd need a chainsaw.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		So what the hell does "Kipchak" mean?

				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
		Uh, it's a code name... for weapons
		using the Yersinia Pestis bacillus...

He really doesn't want to be the one telling the President
about this.



				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
			(continuing)
		Kipchaks were Asian nomads. In 1347
		they attacked a Genoese fort, and
		catapulted infected corpses over the
		walls. The Genoese who survived
		carried the disease back to Europe...
		and it killed half the population.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		Get to the goddamn point, Major.

The Intelligence Officer looks at the CIA Chief.

				CIA CHIEF
		Seems the missile is armed with a
		warhead carrying the Pneumonic
		Plague.

The President goes nuts.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		The Black Plague?! Every time I talk
		to you fuckin' guys it gets worse!
		What happened to this "limited
		retaliation" shit?

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		The North Koreans insist the missile
		carries a conventional payload. They
		say we're trying to trick them into
		aborting the attack.

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		Especially since the uplink from our
		Op in P'yÚngyang was unencrypted.

				CIA CHIEF
		We think one of the Hard-liners
		switched the warhead without the
		Premier's knowledge. But he's not
		about to take our word for it, and
		he's too weak to risk the
		humiliation of backing down.

				PRESIDENT
			(incredulous; thru video
			link)
		They use a biological weapon on
		American soil, they have to know
		we'll respond!



				SECRETARY OF STATE
		Maybe they don't think we got the
		guts. Maybe they want a war, 'cause
		they think they can whip us, like
		what happened in 'Nam. Look who
		we're dealing with: a teetering,
		outlaw regime, and inside it, some
		wild-ass renegades working their
		screwy agenda!

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		What the hell are we doing in L.A.?

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		We've deployed Marines from Pendleton
		and Twenty-Nine Palms, Army from Ft.
		Irwin, put 'em in protective suits,
		but it's 40 minutes before they're on
		the ground.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		All right. Assuming the worst...
		What'll happen?

The Intelligence Officer demonstrates with another of his
COMPUTER GRAPHICS.

				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
		The warhead vents the plague
		bacteria above the target area,
		infecting about 50,000 people. First
		symptoms are vomiting, lymph nodes
		become swollen; temperature rises to
		105. Victims turn deep purple from
		lung hemorrhaging, usually die the
		same day.
			(beat)
		There are treatments -- streptomycin
		and tetracyclines -- but we'd be
		overwhelmed by the numbers and its
		extreme contagiousness.

				CIA CHIEF
		We could have 500,000 infected in a
		week, who knows how many after that.

Long beat as everyone tries to contemplate the unthinkable.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		I'm gonna toast those fuckers! Have
		the Summit leaders been warned?



				FBI CHIEF
		Yes, sir... no one's landing in L.A.
		'til we give the all-clear.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		And you're sure it's safe if we can
		get 'em to destroy the missile in
		flight?

				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
		The bacteria can't survive the heat
		of an explosion.

				CIA CHIEF
		I suggest none of this go any
		further -- not even to the agents
		working to find the family. Word
		leaks out to a city of 12 million
		people there's rocket full of the
		Plague coming at 'em, you'll create
		a panic of biblical proportions.

Colonel Lee mutters something to Ambassador Han in Korean.

		Perhaps someone will decide it is
		foolish to incur the wrath of North

		Yeah, the U.S. is behind the whole

				CARSON
		Let's grab a few beers, kick back

		Why wait until five?

Ambassador Han and Walther keep Carson and Colonel Lee from
going at each other.

				MIRANDA
		Pete!

		Hey, I'm not the only one with a rep

Meanwhile, we hear the high-pitched whine as Dave's MODEM
connects with another computer. Dave's fingers fly across the
keyboard, and in a moment, a PICTURE of Javal appears: hair
longer, bearded... but the eyes are unmistakable.

				DAVE

		He's on our hit parade. Interpol

		Raised in Quebec. Moved to Europe;

				CARSON
		Get his Driver's License number;
		Social; bank accounts; charge cards;

		On occasion, my wife has been known
		to kick my ankle under the table.

Miranda gives Carson a "your turn to be gracious" look.

				CARSON
		Sounds like her aim's a little low.

Not exactly what Miranda was hoping for. Dave hands Carson a
piece of paper.

				DAVE
		Address, according to the Auto Shop.

				CARSON
			(looks at paper)
		Apartment 1060! He's in a high-rise!
		Sabatini -- you're with us.
			(off Robbins' disappointed
			look)
		She's got the field experience.

Carson and Miranda grab their jackets, then she stops.

				MIRANDA
		There still could be accomplices.
		If there are, they'll hear us in
		the helicopter.

Carson looks again at the address...

				CARSON
		There's a TV station a couple blocks
		away. We'll land on their pad.
			(to Robbins)
		K-EYE. Clear it with 'em. Have a
		SWAT team assemble, but tell 'em to
		hang back unless we need 'em.

EXT.  OSAKA, JAPAN - ESTABLISHING - DAY

SUPER: Osaka. Western Japan.

INT.  OSAKA APARTMENT - DAY

In the tiny bedroom of a wheelchair-bound JAPANESE TEENAGER,
computers and HAM RADIO equipment are stacked everywhere.

He turns on a tape recorder. We hear a faint, crackling VOICE:



				OPERATIVE'S VOICE (VO)
			(on recorder)
		...Missile heading to L.A. has a
		Kipchak Warhead! Repeat: missile is
		Kipchak equipped!

The Teenager rolls to a computer running CompuServe. He clicks
the CHAT icon, types: "Anyone up on their spy terminology?"

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - LOS ANGELES - DAY

With the gardeners gone, and their sound sensors disabled,
Mrs. Han, Joy and Sam are SHOUTING for help.

They listen for a response; it is completely quiet.

EXT.  K-EYE STUDIOS - LANDING PAD - LOS ANGELES - DAY

Just as the government helicopter lands, Bobbi's news copter
lands right next to it.

Bobbi intercepts Carson, Sabatini, Miranda and Colonel Lee on
the pad. Her Cameraman follows, ENG camera on his shoulder,
videotaping everything.

				CARSON
		Oh, great, the media...
			(realizing)
		It's the goddamn traffic girl!

				MIRANDA
		Traffic person.

				BOBBI
		Where are you going?

				CARSON
		We can't get into that right now...

				BOBBI
		Hey, you expect to use my station's
		facilities and not even tell us --

Carson grabs the ENG camera, pops the videotape out of it and
crushes the tape.

				MIRANDA
			(to Bobbi)
		Sorry...



				BOBBI
			(looks Miranda over)
		What the fuck are you, the Barbie
		Corporate Ass-Lick model?

Miranda is utterly aghast. She reaches under Carson's jacket
and takes the handcuffs off his shoulder rig. She grabs Bobbi
by the arm and gets her in a half-Nelson.

				MIRANDA
		Guess what, Sister... you're about
		to spend the next five years in a
		penitentiary for interfering with a
		federal investigation.

The STATION MANAGER comes running out of the building.

				STATION MANAGER
		Bobbi! I promised we'd respect their
		news blackout!

				BOBBI
			(to herself)
		Figures... you dickless wonder.

Bobbi wriggles out of Miranda's grasp. Carson looks at his
wife, who's still fuming, and smiles to himself.

The Station Manager hands Carson the keys to his Lexus.

				STATION MANAGER
		I get an exclusive later, right?

				CARSON
		This works out, I'll play the
		fuckin' banjo for you.

EXT.  SKY OVER PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY

The cruise missile makes a slight course adjustment.

EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

People begin to arrive at the events. BOOSTERS pass out food,
wine and beer... and crank up the Beach Boys TUNES.

Meanwhile, law enforcement cars move into the areas with high
rises -- Century City, Westwood, downtown, etc.

EXT.  U.S. AIR BASE - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

A sign on the control tower reads: U.S. Air Force, Okinawa.

Flight Crews direct a squadron of planes out onto the flight
line: F-16 fighter bombers, along with F-15 fighter escorts.

They begin to TAKE OFF...



EXT.  FOUNTAIN AVENUE - DAY

The Lexus is stuck in a dense knot of traffic.

Carson gets out and walks across the hoods of the stopped
vehicles around him -- to much COMPLAINING by their owners --
until he finds the reason for the jam-up:

Along the shoulder of the road, a long line of equipment
trailers and motor homes, cables, lights, rent-a-cops and
gawkers. A MOVIE SHOOT. Carson groans.

He hurries back to the Lexus. Miranda rolls her window down.

				CARSON
		We're hoofing it.

Miranda and Colonel Lee immediately get out of the car and run
off, leaving Sabatini to contend with it.

				SABATINI
			(pissed)
		'She's got the field experience'...
		To park the fuckin' car!

EXT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - DAY

A boxy, ten-story complex built in the sixties.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - DAY

Carson, (FBI jacket folded over his arm) Miranda, and Colonel
Lee rush into the lobby.

Carson is about to show the CONCIERGE behind the desk his i.d,
but the Concierge is nervous and sweating. Carson pulls out
his Sig 9mm, approaches the door behind the desk, which is
ajar... He pushes it open...

And finds himself staring at the muzzles of three M-16 rifles.

Three SWAT TEAM members are standing there in full body armor.

				CARSON
			(pulls out his i.d.)
		Whoa... FBI..!

They lower their weapons.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		How the hell you get here so fast?



				SWAT TEAM #1
		They're shootin' a cop movie down
		the street. We're workin' as extras.

				CARSON
		Terrific. Who else is here?

				SWAT TEAM #1
		Three officers on the roof, next
		building over, and two in the tenth-
		floor hallway.

				CARSON
		Tell 'em to be cool. We're going up.
			(to Concierge)
		Give me your master key.

EXT.  ADJACENT APARTMENTS - DAY

The SWAT team SHARPSHOOTERS crouch on the roof.

				SWAT TEAM #1
			(thru radio)
		Feds going up -- Anglo male and
		female; Asian male.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - DAY

Sabatini drives the Lexus in and parks it in the fire lane.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - HALLWAY - DAY

The fire door opens next to an elevator with the number "10"
on it, and Carson, Miranda and Colonel Lee come out.

Carson and Miranda creep quietly along the hallway, toward
apartment 1060. Carson listens at the door, hears nothing.

He moves to the next door down, apartment 1058, and quietly
unlocks the door.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - #1058 - DAY

The shades are drawn, and the apartment is dark.

As Carson and Miranda cut through the apartment, they realize
there's a WOMAN lying in the bed. She's naked, and she's not
alone. Someone is under the sheets. ANOTHER WOMAN.

The first Woman opens her eyes, sees the intruders, and grabs
for a Colt Gold Cup .45 auto in the dresser drawer.

				WOMAN
		What the fuck..!

Her friend sits up. Miranda holds her finger to her lips and
shows them her FBI shield.

				MIRANDA
		Sorry...

Carson cranks open their window and steps out onto the foot-
wide, ornamental balcony.

				CARSON
			(to Miranda)
		Wait here.

She begins to protest. He shoots her a look that silences her.

EXT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - DAY

The SWAT sharpshooters watch from the next building over as
Carson, ten floors up, peers through the slit in between the
curtains into the window of Javal's apartment.

He swings his legs over onto Javal's ornamental balcony... the
bolts holding the rail onto the wall are loose and rusty...
the balcony SLIPS a little...

He leans on the crank-operated window until it SNAPS open.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - JAVAL'S APARTMENT - DAY

Carson steps inside. He looks around the bedroom -- it's
empty. No furnishings, the closet shelves are bare, even the
pictures on the walls are gone, leaving only their outline.

Carson cautiously goes into the living room --

It's also empty. All that remains are a few cardboard boxes,
and three flower pots in macramÈ ceiling hangers by the living
room window. Some dead leaves lie on the floor beneath them.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		I'm in. It's empty, but sit tight
		while I look around.

Carson cautiously approaches the cardboard boxes.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - #1058 - DAY

The clock on the bedstand reads 4:25. Miranda smiles
uncomfortably at the two naked women together in bed.

				MIRANDA
		I like what you've done with the
		place...



INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - HALLWAY - DAY

The elevator DINGS. Sabatini comes out, H&K MP-5 in hand.

SWAT Team #2, standing on the far side of the hallway with
Colonel Lee, sees her machine pistol and takes aim.

				COLONEL LEE
		Wait!

Colonel Lee walks over to Sabatini.

				SABATINI
		Where's Carson?

				COLONEL LEE
		Inside.

Sabatini starts down the hall. Colonel Lee stays where he is.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - JAVAL'S APARTMENT - DAY

Carson cautiously peers in the moving boxes. They're empty.

He crosses to the front door, looks it over, unlocks the
deadbolt. He turns the knob, the button POPS open...

He stops, noticing a HAIRLINE SEAM in the doorjamb where a
piece was cut, then neatly replaced.

Then, he's startled as he hears a strange, mechanical whining
NOISE coming from the kitchen.

He goes to investigate -- it's an almost-dead, avocado-green
refrigerator straining to start its compressor. He looks for
booby-traps, opens it, and looks inside. Empty.

Looking down, he notices he's got a dead leaf stuck to the
bottom of his shoe.

Glancing in the living room, he sees the dead leaves on the
floor below the three hanging plants. He looks at the plants:
two are dead. The one in the middle is not. It's plastic.

We HEAR the jiggle of the front doorknob.

				CARSON
		NO! --

Too late... The front door opens....

Carson crouches behind the big, heavy refrigerator door...

As the middle flower pot EXPLODES. It's a shrapnel bomb: it
spews thousands of tiny carpet tacks 360 degrees around room.

Sabatini is HIT full on -- she falls backwards into the hall.



INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - #1058 - DAY

Miranda and the women in the darkened bedroom SCREAM as the
tacks tear hundreds of HOLES through sections of the wall.

Tiny shafts of LIGHT appear in the wall, except where it is
covered by furniture (keeping them from being shredded.)

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - HALLWAY - DAY

SWAT Team #2 and Colonel Lee come running, as does Miranda.

Carson is kneeling next to Sabatini. She looks up at him and
tries to say something, but a only long, mournful, final
BREATH escapes her. Agonized, Carson looks around...

And sees Colonel Lee. He lunges for him.

				CARSON
		I said keep everyone back!!

He punches Colonel Lee in the jaw. Colonel Lee slams against
the wall, then comes back at Carson, hitting him in the throat.

				MIRANDA
		Stop it!

Miranda and SWAT Team #2 pull them apart.

				CARSON
			(to Colonel Lee)
		Get out of my sight.

He kneels next to Sabatini, and closes her eyes.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

It's in between reports. The Cameraman listens to the Grateful
Dead on a BOOM BOX. Bobbi answers her ringing CELL PHONE.

				BOBBI
			(into phone)
		Marchfelder.

				STATION MANAGER (VO)
			(thru phone)
		You dated the Mayor, right?

				BOBBI
			(sighs; into phone)
		You need a traffic ticket fixed?



				STATION MANAGER (VO)
			(excited; thru phone)
		Try to confirm something for us.
		There's an incredible buzz on the
		Internet -- someone picked up a
		classified message on a U.S.
		Intelligence frequency. We think
		it's authentic!

EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

The streets of Hollywood are even more congested than before,
as the festivities really start rockin'.

INT.  GOVERNMENT HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson and Miranda sit together in the back and Colonel Lee
sits next to the Pilot as they fly back to the Consulate.

Miranda looks at Carson, who's trying real hard not to let
Sabatini's death slow him down.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		What's the status?

				ROBBINS (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Wilshire and West PD Divisions had
		seven vehicles running with sirens at
		9:32. They're getting the routes from
		the officers now.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Hurry it the hell up.

He glances over at Miranda. After a beat:

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		I should've known she'd come up.

				MIRANDA
		Pete --

				CARSON
		-- "Should've." Shit, there's a
		familiar word.
			(long beat)
		That day... I was there soon enough.
		We should've rushed 'em, before they
		could finish setting up...



				MIRANDA
		The Bureau never would've let you.
		They want it by the book: talk them
		out.

Carson looks out the window, not hearing a word she says...

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT./EXT.  BEVERLY THRIFT - (FLASHBACK) - DAY

Carson is in the FBI command truck, talking on the phone to:

A BANK ROBBER, barricaded inside the bank. Phone in hand, he
holds a shotgun on a dozen hostages: BANK EMPLOYEES and
CUSTOMERS -- including a couple of YOUNG KIDS. One is holding
a soccer-sized, rainbow-colored rubber ball.

The OTHER BANK ROBBER wires up a series of explosive charges.

Both Robbers rush inside the vault, and pull the door closed
to protect themselves...

The front of the building, where the hostages are, EXPLODES.

Carson runs to the bank. He spots the kid's ball, rolling in
the street... BURNING. He turns away, horrified, devastated...

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  GOVERNMENT HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

				CARSON
		Twelve bodies -- only the hostages.

				MIRANDA
		You were a greenhorn. It wasn't your
		decision. You can't keep living as
		such a raw nerve, never sleeping --

				CARSON
		-- Those kids were ten years old!
			(sotto)
		Same age as the Han boy...

He turns away. She takes his hand.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

The family continues to call for HELP. As they do, we

							CUT TO:



INT.  HALLWAY JUST OUTSIDE APARTMENT - DAY

Their CRIES echo faintly through a deserted tangle of ladders,
construction equipment, sheets of drywall, etc.

A warning sign taped to the wall near the elevator reads:
     
		This Floor Has Been Temporarily Vacated
		For Minor Earthquake Retrofitting.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

The mood is glum. Carson looks at Robbins, Dave and Walther,
then at the empty chair where Sabatini had been sitting.

				CARSON
		C'mon! Who's pulling Javal's bank
		records? What about cross-referencing
		possible aliases? We got 33 minutes!

Hearing Beach Boys MUSIC on the TV's and radios on the
surveillance console, Carson angrily punches them all off.

Suddenly, Miranda looks at him:

				MIRANDA
		Camry! The billboard! Toyota Camry!
			(reaches for phone)
		Where are the numbers for the
		outdoor ad companies?

				ROBBINS
		Parker Center's making those calls.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Bobbi and the News Cameraman are arguing bitterly:

				BOBBI
		Turn the fuckin' camera on! DO IT!!

				CAMERAMAN
		Maybe it's true... probably is true.
		That's why they got a news blackout!

				BOBBI
		I'll rip your miserable eyeballs
		out! NEWS IS OUR FUCKIN' JOB!!

He sighs and turns the CAMERA on.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - INCLUDE ANGLE ON TV - DAY

The Han family listens to Bobbi, amazed, horrified...



				BOBBI
			(on TV)
		...A warning was radioed to U.S.
		Intelligence that a biological weapon,
		allegedly containing the deadly
		Pneumonic Plague, is approaching Los
		Angeles. While unconfirmed, the
		President and other leaders are all
		late in arriving...

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

The TV's are off -- so they see none of Bobbi's report.

Carson crosses to Dave. He's at his computer, looking at a
long column of telephone numbers.

				DAVE
		Finally got the call list from
		Javal's phone. Most aren't his;
		they're from the legit user who
		didn't know his number was cloned.

				CARSON
		Go to the bottom of the list, work
		back through the last 12 hours.

Dave jumps to the bottom, points at a number.

				DAVE
		Here's the call to the Consulate --
		965-5000.
			(while scrolling)
		The rest are dupes... all from the
		other guy...

				CARSON
		Wait... go back... the one at seven
		this morning...

Dave highlights a number: 213-965-5666.

WIDER

Carson glances over at the telephone on Colonel Lee's desk.

(FLASHBACK) - CLOSE ON PHONE

from when Carson took a call there, pushing the mute button.

(FLASHBACK) - EXTREME CLOSE UP

on the label showing the phone's extension number: "x666."



BACK TO SCENE

Across the room, Colonel Lee is watching Carson intently.

Carson turns to look at him. They make eye contact.

Time stands still.

Realization.

Feeling like he's moving in SLOW MOTION, Carson reaches for
the Sig 9mm in his shoulder holster.

Colonel Lee grabs the AMD-74 machine gun on the desk.

				CARSON
		Get down!

Colonel Lee STRAFES the room and backs toward the door.

The BULLETS trace a line across the room. One of the North
Korean Espionage Agents is HIT. He slams against the console.

Carson tackles Ambassador Han and shoves him onto the floor,
while popping off several ROUNDS in Colonel Lee's direction.

Robbins also dives for cover, pushing Walther down first.
Robbins takes a BULLET in the shoulder.

Miranda is HIT. The impact tumbles her over the desk.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		MIRANDA!

Colonel Lee, still FIRING, slips out the door.

Gunsmoke hangs in the air as Carson scrambles to Miranda.
Several PHONES have begun ringing. No one notices them.

Dave never moved -- he sits hunched over, clutching his
notebook computer, muttering the HAIL MARY.

Carson rolls Miranda over. She's got a large, scorched bullet
hole in the front of her blouse. Carson tears her blouse open.
She's wearing a kelvar vest under it, and the slug is
mushroomed against the vest.

She awakens, GASPS and starts swinging her fists at him.
Carson is overwhelmed with relief.

Then he notices Robbins, bleeding profusely, propped against
the wall next to Walther. Walther is dead -- shot in the head.

OS, we hear several SPURTS of machine gun fire, and a car
ENGINE roaring to life. Miranda looks at Carson...

				MIRANDA
		Go..!

EXT.  WILSHIRE BLVD - DAY

The city's reaction to Bobbi's announcement is immediate and
severe. It makes the panic during the '92 riots look like a
drive in the country.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Carson bursts through the door just as the second armored
Mercedes CRASHES through the wrought-iron entry gates. Carson
fires several SHOTS, which ping harmlessly off the Mercedes.

Carson sprints for a car. Miranda's Volvo is the closest one.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - DAY

As Carson is starting it, the passenger door opens and
Ambassador Han gets in.

				CARSON
		Get the fuck out of here!

Ambassador Han responds by putting on his seat belt. Carson
sighs and tears out of the driveway.

EXT.  FREMONT PLACE - DAY

Colonel Lee crashes through the Fremont Place guard gate, then
hangs a right on Wilshire. He drives the center turn lane,
zooming past the snarl of cars.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

In the back of the Consulate, Miranda, sore as hell, climbs
into the government copter. It WHINES to life and TAKES OFF.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson looks around at the chaos around them.

				CARSON
		Shit, it's like a Godzilla movie out
		here!

Then he HEARS, on a nearby car's FM RADIO:



				FM NEWSCASTER (VO)
			(thru car radio)
		...These words, which have terrified
		the city:

				RECORDING OF BOBBI (VO)
			(thru car radio)
		...A biological weapon, allegedly

Stunned, Carson looks over at Ambassador Han, who buries his
face in his hands.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Miranda..!

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru radio)
		I heard. I'm in the copter.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		I want you to get out of here...

INT.  GOVERNMENT HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Miranda is flying just behind Carson's Volvo. The TRAFFIC is
beyond nightmarish. She smiles at his concern for her.

				MIRANDA
			(into radio)
		Shut up and keep your eyes on the
		road. That's my goddamn car.
			(beat; into radio)
		Dave? You staying on top of the
		research?

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Sweating, Dave is watching the ACTION outside on a TV while
hurriedly bandaging Robbins' shoulder with some torn cloth. He
grabs for the two-way and we realize he's panicking.

				DAVE
			(into radio)
		I can't... My kids...

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru radio; calmly)
		Listen: the best way to help them is
		to stay at your computer. If any

He squeezes his eyes shut... After a long beat:



				DAVE
			(into radio)
		Okay...

EXT.  SKY OVER LOS ANGELES - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Several large military helicopters approach -- troop
contingents from Pendleton and Ft. Irwin.

The big CH-54 dual-rotor copters set down and offload MARINES
and ARMY INFANTRY.

Others, like Apache Gunship combat copters and Hueys, begin to
follow the pursuit. They join the police and TV copters, and
it looks like the Ride of the Valkyries.

EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

People flee from the festivities in droves. Seeing the
helicopters and TROOPS in bio suits only fuels the hysteria.

We hear news REPORTS coming from car radios, boom boxes, TV's.
Reporters chatter urgently in English, Spanish, Japanese,
Korean, Farsi, their voices mixing with the shouts of
pedestrians, the rumbling and horn-blowing of the traffic...

Everyone, everywhere is getting into their cars in a mad dash
to get out of town or rendezvous with loved ones.

This is the mother of all rush hours.

EXT.  WESTERN AVENUE - DAY

Colonel Lee's car turns right onto Western Avenue. He's in the
heart of Koreatown -- hardly any of the signs are in English.

He swerves through the panicked drivers jamming the roads --
in the center lane, or into the oncoming traffic. The cars he
HITS crumple against the Mercedes without slowing it down.

Carson's Volvo follows, squeezing through traffic in its wake.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) DAY

Bobbi is salivating with excitement (and antacid.) She snaps
off her mic and yells at her Cameraman:

				BOBBI
		Don't lose the Benz, moron... pull

		us... this is fuckin' great...

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Ambassador Han looks glumly at the chaos in the streets.



				CARSON
		...The Colonel hired Javal, made it
		look like he was working alone. Then
		he made sure Javal got killed, so
		we'd never find your family -- and
		they'd have an excuse to drop their
		bomb. But what's in it for 'em?

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		There are men in my government whose
		power depends on North Korea staying
		as it is: Socialist, repressive,
		isolated from the world. They'll
		resort to anything, even war, to
		keep it that way. They have the
		Hitler Syndrome: if their country
		cannot exist the way they want it,
		they would rather see it destroyed.

EXT.  WESTERN AVENUE - DAY

Colonel Lee gets stuck in a line of cars trying to get onto
the 10 East. Above, a swarm of HELICOPTERS circle him.

				VREELAND (VO)
			(thru radio)
		We've got the situation in hand.

INT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - DAY

Colonel Lee sees the Apache helicopter approach. He leans into
the back seat, knocking the top off a long, plastic crate.



INT.  APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

The SUNROOF on the Mercedes slides open. Colonel Lee's upper
body pokes through the sunroof. He's holding a manportable
S.A.M. -- a 3-foot-long, fiberglass rocket launcher.

Vreeland tries to bring his machine guns to bear on Colonel
Lee, but there's no time...

				VREELAND
			(to Pilot)
		Shit! Pull back!

EXT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - DAY

Colonel Lee depresses the trigger on the launcher and a
rolling-pin-sized rocket is EXPELLED.

EXT.  SKY ABOVE WESTERN AVENUE - DAY

The rocket SLAMS into a police helicopter just in front of the
Apache, creating a huge FIREBALL, turning the copter into two
tons of red-hot shrapnel.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - DAY

Carson and Ambassador Han watch with horror.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

A hundred yards away, they're BUFFETED by the explosion.

		Jesus fuckin' God!!!

		Uh, I think we're gonna set down
		now. Back to you, Brent.

EXT.  WESTERN AVENUE - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

The burning hull of the police copter CRASHES into a mini-
mall, causing a FIRE and EXPLOSION.

Hot metal and debris PINGS and POPS as it rains over the
neighborhood, sending cars and pedestrians rushing for cover.

EXT.  HELICOPTERS - DAY

Vreeland's Apache and the remaining helicopters scramble away.

				VREELAND
			(into radio)
		Out of the air, or retreat 7,000

The copters set down in parking lots, rooftops, wherever.
Armed troops climb out to keep PANICKED MOBS from swarming
them in an attempt to leave the city.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - INCLUDE ANGLE ON TV - DAY

The Han family watches the TV, amazed, as Colonel Lee ducks
back down into the Mercedes and closes the sunroof.

				JOY
		I always hated that guy...

EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

Other drivers, not knowing whether Colonel Lee's rocket is the
biological missile, scatter away from him. Colonel Lee
squeezes onto the freeway on-ramp.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Pieces of burning DEBRIS are still landing nearby. Carson
looks at Ambassador Han:

				CARSON
		One of yours?
			(Han nods)
		What the hell do you need heat-

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		There could be another riot...

				CARSON
			(shakes his head)
		And they call me Mr. Overkill.

He looks at Han.

		Strela-2...

		Strela-2 anti-aircraft rockets?

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Dave, calmer but still sweating, taps at his computer. A

Several police cars clear a path for two huge, yellow DWP
BULLDOZERS borrowed from a construction cite.

They rumble up onto the eastbound freeway, turn, and then
stop, side by side, facing oncoming traffic. They lower their
huge front shovels to create a roadblock.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - CLOSE - DAY

Bobbi sits impatiently, microphone in hand...

WIDER

The copter has landed behind an AM-PM Minimart/gas station.

Bobbi, her Pilot and her Cameraman turn when they hear a
KNOCKING on the windshield of their copter...

Oblivious to the panic on the streets, a raggedy HOMELESS GUY
stands with a spray bottle, wanting to wash the windows on the
copter. Bobbi gulps some Mylanta and waves him away:

				BOBBI
		Save it for someone who gives a
		shit!



EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

All of the celebration locales are trampled, abandoned messes.
So much for "Fun Fun Fun" and L.A. putting on its best.

MOBS make panicked runs on the stock in grocery, drug and
hardware stores. Violence breaks out in the aisles and parking
lots.

PEOPLE in their homes work feverishly to seal their doors and
windows against the plague with tape, towels, plastic.

INT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Colonel Lee screeches to a stop 500 feet from the bulldozers,
angling the Mercedes so the driver's door is facing them.

EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

The windows on the Mercedes glide open....

Carson hurries to catch up to it...

Colonel Lee FIRES a rocket at the bulldozers through the
driver's side window. The BACKBLAST from the launcher vents
through the passenger's side.

The ROCKET impacts the bulldozer on the left; the EXPLOSION
actually FLIPS the huge machine head over tail into the air.

The bulldozer lands upside down on the lane divider, crushing
a portion of it.

Colonel Lee rolls up his windows and drives around the burning
wreckage.

The other drivers really give him wide berth now...

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Approaching downtown, Colonel Lee turns onto the 110 north.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Traffic moves aside for Colonel Lee's notorious Mercedes.
Carson catches up to it.

				DAVE (VO)
			(thru radio)
		...The Strela-2 needs 45 meters to
		arm, so stay tight on his ass.

Carson SLAMS his Volvo into the Mercedes. Ambassador Han
braces himself on the dashboard. Carson looks over at him.



				CARSON
		That Kraut-mobile have any weaknesses
		you'd like to tell me about?

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		I don't think so -- they said it was
		solid as a rock.

				CARSON
			(looks at his crumpled car)
		No shit...

As Carson moves forward, Colonel Lee's window opens enough to
allow the barrel of his AMD-74 machine gun to poke through.

Carson shoves Ambassador Han's head down and ducks. Colonel
Lee STRAFES the Volvo.

Carson looks up just in time to see...

A pickup truck, ahead, stalled on the shoulder.

Carson slams on the brakes, but it's too late... The Volvo
CRASHES headfirst into the back of the truck.

The Volvo's AIRBAGS deploy, stopping Carson and Ambassador Han
from plowing into the dashboard. After a beat:

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(dazed)
		I can't believe I'm still alive...

				CARSON
		This were a Hyundai you wouldn't be.

Ambassador Han looks at Carson, wondering if he's putting him
on. The car is a twisted mess. Carson can't get the door open.

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

A red and white LAFD paramedic's ambulance puts on its SIREN
and hurries to the Volvo. Two PARAMEDICS jump out.

				CARSON
		Get me out of here...

They pry his door open with a crowbar. Carson climbs onto the
roof of his car. Grimacing from pain, he looks around.

				CARSON
			(continuing; into radio)
		Anybody see him?

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Still heading north on the 110.

The Paramedics pry the passenger door open and help Ambassador
Han out. Carson looks at the ambulance. He's getting an idea...

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Dave... You're sure those rockets
		are heat-seeking?

				DAVE (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Classic IR, reflective optical
		system. How come?

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Just keep working your leads...

Carson climbs into the back of the ambulance.

INT.  AMBULANCE - DAY

Carson rummages through the supplies, finds what he's looking
for, and (BELOW FRAME) starts stuffing them into a canvas bag.

EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

Carson climbs onto the roof of the ambulance.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		This is Carson. I need a copter.

EXT.  HELICOPTERS - (VARIOUS ANGLES) - DAY

Everyone in the grounded helicopters -- LAPD, National Guard,
Marines, media -- react to Carson's request as if he's crazy.

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Something small and nimble.
		Anybody... come in low, from the
		south... I'm on an ambulance by the
		9th Street exit.

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Are you out of your mind?

INT.  NEWS COPTER - DAY

Bobbi is standing next to her copter in the back of the
minimart, listening to this exchange on a POLICE SCANNER. Her
Cameraman is eating a microwave burrito. Bobbi jumps in, grabs
the ENG camera, and yells at her Pilot:



				BOBBI
		Get this fuckin' thing in the air!
			(to Cameraman)
		Out! Not enough room for four.

				CAMERAMAN
			(as they TAKE OFF)
		What am I supposed to do when the
		plague comes, hold my breath?

INT.  POLICE CRUISER - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

They rapidly cut through the traffic.

				MIRANDA
			(into radio)
		Switch to a secure channel.
			(flips a switch)
		What on earth are you thinking?

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru radio)
		I'll make him open the sunroof.
		Someone can shoot tear gas or a
		percussion grenade inside.

				MIRANDA
			(into radio)
		Pete, you haven't gone... suicidal or
		anything on me, have you?

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru radio)
		No way. I couldn't stand making so
		many people happy.

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Carson waves his arms as he sees a helicopter approaching.

The glare from the sun masks the copter's markings. It HOVERS
above him. With the canvas bag slung over his shoulder, Carson
jumps up onto the runner, then climbs up inside the cockpit.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson closes the door, then sees Bobbi.

				CARSON
		You?! I wanted a police copter!

				PILOT
		Just tell me what to do. I flew two
		tours in 'Nam.



				BOBBI
		And he doesn't go unless I go!

				CARSON
		Wrong-o...

							CUT TO:

EXT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

The door opens and Bobbi comes TUMBLING out of it!

WIDER

They're hovering above the roof of a high-rise hotel downtown.
Bobbi lands with a huge SPLASH in the rooftop swimming pool.

BOBBI

surfaces, sputtering and screaming:

				BOBBI
		I'm a respected electronic
		journalist, you fuckin' prick!!

Carson replies by tossing her industrial-sized bottle of
Mylanta out after her.

EXT.  SKY ABOVE OCEAN - FOLLOW CRUISE MISSILE - DAY

In the distance, there is smog on the horizon.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

They follow the 110 north. Ahead, Carson sees the Mercedes
cutting across lanes.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Got 'im -- looks like he's headed
		for the 101.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson has the Pilot hover just above and behind the Mercedes.
It comes to a stop and the sunroof opens up.

Carson lashes himself to the copter's center post with a piece
of the seat harness, then slides the door open.

He reaches into the canvas bag and takes out a road flare. He
breaks the flare open, IGNITING it.



				CARSON
			(to Pilot)
		Pull hard to the left, on my
		signal...

He braces himself on door jamb...

Below, Colonel Lee's head pokes up from the sunroof.

EXT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - DAY

Colonel Lee calmly aims the rocket launcher and FIRES.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson tosses the lit flare, hard, away from the helicopter.

				CARSON
		Now!

The Pilot swings the helicopter in the other direction, and
the rocket FOLLOWS the flare, streaking past the helicopter.

A few seconds later, the rocket EXPLODES in midair behind them.

INT.  POLICE CRUISER - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Miranda sees what Carson is doing.

				MIRANDA
		You fucking lunatic!!

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

The News Pilot looks over at Carson.

				PILOT
		Hope you got more flares than he's
		got rockets.

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Miranda and the L.A. Cop, both holding small tear gas pistols,
split up. Crouching behind the cars on the freeway, they sneak
up on the stopped Mercedes.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson takes another flare out of the canvas bag. He breaks
the top off... and it doesn't ignite.

Below, Colonel Lee loads another rocket into the launcher...



EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Miranda is climbing the metal stairs leading to a graffiti-
covered freeway sign.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson fumbles to pull another flare out of the canvas bag.

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Avoiding coils of razor-sharp concertina wire around the sign,
Miranda FIRES a tear gas canister at the Mercedes' sunroof.

It misses, bouncing off the windshield, filling the area with
white smoke. Colonel Lee keeps his eye on the copter...

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson gets the new flare lit and throws it away from the
copter just as Colonel Lee FIRES another rocket.

The rocket EXPLODES a few dozen yards away. Shrapnel PEPPERS
the copter, DAMAGING the rear rotor.

Struggling to maintain control, the Pilot heads for the Sixth
Street on-ramp, below the freeway, out of the line of fire.

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Colonel Lee spots Miranda, up on the freeway sign, loading
another tear gas canister. He STRAFES the sign.

She flattens; the BULLETS tear through the sign above her.

The L.A. Cop rushes the Mercedes. Colonel Lee FIRES at him,
hitting him across the legs.

Colonel Lee ducks back into the Mercedes and drives away.

VARIOUS ANGLES

As Miranda comes down from the sign...

Carson climbs up the embankment from Sixth Street to the 101...

The downed L.A. Cop waves as a pair of ambulances drive up,
lights flashing and sirens WAILING.

Carson runs alongside one of the ambulances, pulling the
driver's door open before it's stopped.

The Paramedic is the one who helped him and Ambassador Han out
of the Volvo. Carson yanks him out of his ambulance.



				MIRANDA
		Sorry...

INT.  AMBULANCE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson jumps in. Miranda climbs in the passenger's side. As he
peels away, Miranda smacks Carson on the head.

				MIRANDA
		You're completely deranged! Playing
		chicken with rockets!

				CARSON
		Well, what the hell were you doing
		out there?

				AMBASSADOR HAN (OS)
		What are both of you doing?

Carson turns, surprised and annoyed to see Ambassador Han, his
arm bandaged, lying in the cot in the back.

				CARSON
		Oh, for Christ's sake... Hold on!

Lights and SIRENS going, they rush into the 110/101 interchange.

Ahead, Colonel Lee's Mercedes is driving through the cars that
are parting like the Red Sea for him.

				MIRANDA
		Even if we can pry him out with...
			(looks at her watch)
		Twelve minutes to go, I doubt he'll
		be very cooperative.

				CARSON
		I'll just use my outstanding people
		skills.

Carson glances up at the sign showing the upcoming exit:
Glendale Blvd - Echo Park. A thought is forming...

				CARSON
			(continuing; to Ambassador
			Han)
		That car's like a rock, right?

EXT.  HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - DAY

Carson suddenly cuts to the left. When they reach the Glendale
Blvd exit, he SLAMS the ambulance into the side of the
Mercedes, forcing it onto the freeway off-ramp.



INT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson pushes the Mercedes across Bellevue Avenue, toward the
park surrounding Echo Lake. Colonel Lee STRAFES the ambulance.

EXT.  GLENDALE BLVD - DAY

Carson keeps BUMPING the Mercedes as they reach Glendale Blvd,
running right alongside the lake.

With a hard shove, Carson sends the Mercedes SKIDDING off the
road, through the small guardrail, and INTO the lake.

Carson slams on the brakes, fishtailing the ambulance into the
grass surrounding the lake. Sig 9mm in hand, he hops out.

The Mercedes is so heavy that it's already half-submerged.

INT./EXT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - DAY

WATER pours in from the floorboards, the air vents...

Colonel Lee climbs out through the sunroof and FIRES at Carson
with his AMD-74.

EXT.  ECHO LAKE - DAY

Carson ducks behind the ambulance, takes careful aim...

And SHOOTS Colonel Lee, WINGING him in the shoulder. Colonel
Lee's machine gun goes flying, and he tumbles into the water.

Meanwhile, Cops, Army, Marines, etc. arrive via helicopter and
car. Major Vreeland is among them. The news media, ENG cameras
bouncing on their shoulders, run alongside them.

CLOSER

Carson races over to grab Colonel Lee, who is slogging out of
the lake. There is a glint of bright steel... and Colonel Lee
SLASHES at Carson with a knife.

Carson moves aside... but the knife SLICES across his upper
arm. Carson falls backwards.

Colonel Lee, on hands and knees, tries to crawl away. Suddenly,
someone KICKS him in face, flipping him over.

It's Miranda. Colonel Lee's knife goes flying.

Carson, bleeding, piles onto Colonel Lee. Vreeland assists.
Colonel Lee fights like mad to break free...

Until Miranda JAMS her heel into his groin. He cries out.



				MIRANDA
		Ever hear of "fuck-me" pumps?
		Well, these are fuck you pumps!
			(pushes harder)
		Where's the family?

Surprised at his wife's new negotiating technique, Carson
shoots a look at Vreeland. Vreeland grimaces.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Dave sits in front of his computer, phone receiver resting on
his shoulder, riveted by the ACTION on the TV.

				DAVE
		Holy shit -- Knoll-It-All's turned
		into Dirty Harriet!

He turns as his MODEM squawks and another download comes in.

				DAVE
			(continuing; into phone)
		You're sure there were no accounts in
		the other names I gave you?

EXT.  ECHO LAKE - DAY

While Miranda continues to apply encouragement to Colonel
Lee's gonads, Ambassador Han limps over. He yells some ORDERS
at Colonel Lee. After a moment, Colonel Lee sags.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		Let him up.

Carson's not so sure, but they're completely surrounded by
military and law enforcement personnel. He releases his grasp.
Miranda removes her heel.

Then, with lightning reflexes, Colonel Lee grabs Vreeland's
Rock Island Arsenal Colt .45 Auto from its snap-holster.

				COLONEL LEE
		Victory!

Carson dives back onto him. But he twists his arm around and
PULLS the trigger -- with the muzzle underneath his own chin.

Carson, Miranda and Ambassador Han are SPRAYED with his blood.

WIDER

Dumbfounded everybody looks at each other...

Carson, dogged, kneels next to Colonel Lee's body and searches
through his pockets, looking for something, anything.



EXT.  SKY ABOVE OCEAN - FOLLOW CRUISE MISSILE - DAY

Shaking his head, Dave glances at his computer...

Just in time to glimpse the words "First & Last + Deposit" on

				JOY
		They must know we're here...

				ALL
		Help!

No answer.

EXT.  PARK LA BREA - DAY

Police cars, military vehicles, fire trucks, etc. converge on
the complex from all directions.

Several helicopters circle the complex. One has a PA in it:

				VOICE THRU PA
		Han family. Show us your location...

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

The family listens, frustrated, as the HELICOPTERS circle (OS).

Joy carefully slides her arm along the arm rest, then tries to
coax something out of her pocket -- her Zippo lighter.

				JOY
		Mother... Sam...

They look over at her as she lights it. After a beat, Mrs. Han
understands... She hesitates, then:

				MRS. HAN
		Do it.

Joy drops the lighter to the floor, then swats it with her
foot to Mrs. Han. She does the same, passing it to Sam, who's
sitting closest to the window.

With one eye on the VU movement meter, Sam kicks the lighter,
sliding it across the carpet toward the curtains.

INT.  PARK LA BREA OFFICE - DAY

Several COPS and MARINES burst into the office. Milton, the
Assistant Manager, cowers as they SHOOT the lock off the door
to the inner office and rush in.

				MILTON
		It's a brown binder... Says "Rental
		Manifest." You can't miss it...

They literally tear the office apart.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

The FIRE is consuming the curtains. Thick, toxic SMOKE begins
to fill the tiny apartment, and everyone starts coughing.

INT.  APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

They circle, overwhelmed by the sheer number of apartments.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Apartment number would be real
		helpful, gang...

Miranda points to a wisp of SMOKE above one of the towers.

				MIRANDA
		There!

They come around, and spot the FIRE in the apartment's window.
It is nine stories up, four stories below the top floor.

EXT.  SKY ABOVE OCEAN - FOLLOW CRUISE MISSILE - DAY

The coast looms closer.

EXT.  PARK LA BREA - INCLUDE APACHE HELICOPTER - DAY

The Apache hovers parallel to the apartment, 20 feet away.
Carson feeds out a steel cable from a winch...

Then throws a spring-loaded grappling hook onto the thick,
iron balcony railing.

Hanging onto a webbed rescue harness, Carson slides quickly
across the line, onto the balcony. Using the butt of his Sig
9mm, he BREAKS a hole in the glass on the locked sliding glass
door. He reaches through and unlatches it.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

The FLAMES have engulfed both sets of curtains and have begun
to creep across the floor and the ceiling.

Carson glances over at the electronics on the TV: 4:55 PM.

The family is coughing from the smoke, trying not to panic.

In the kitchen, Lisa can't cough through the tape on her
mouth. She's freaking out.

Seeing this, Carson runs over to her and pulls the tape off.
She starts SCREAMING, so he grabs her face.

				CARSON
		Okay... work with me here!

He grabs one of the refrigerator handles and pulls, but it
won't come loose. Lisa cries out in frustration.

				LISA
		Hurry, please hurry...

Carson spots Javal's toolbox. In it, he finds a socket set
handle, which he levers in between the refrigerator handle and
the door. He rips one handle loose, then the other.

Carson turns his attention to the booby-trapped chairs.

Lisa sits on the floor, frantically pulling her handcuffed
hands around her feet so they're in front of her, then runs
for the front door. Just as she reaches it:

				CARSON
		DON'T!

He grabs her before she opens the door. There's a small
magnetic sensor at the top of the door jamb.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		We have to go out the window.

				MRS. HAN
		Can't you disarm the bomb?



				CARSON
		Too risky. Let's concentrate on
		getting you out of here.

He looks at the meters on the electronic units.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		Sound detectors?

				MRS. HAN
		Sam covered them with chewing gum.

				SAM
		High-tech problem, low-tech solution.

Carson looks at Sam, impressed, then peers under the chairs.

				CARSON
		Pressure sensors. Use 'em in
		convertibles: Bad guy sits on your
		seat, he sets the alarm off. These
		are rigged backwards -- get up, you
		set 'em off.

				SAM
		You a bomb expert?

				CARSON
		Nope. But I've had some car alarms
		in my day.
			(to himself)
		For all the goddamn good they do...

Carson looks around, thinking. He spots the roll of duct tape
on the table, grabs it and unrolls a long piece.

				CARSON
			(continuing; to Mrs. Han)
		Slide your arm forward... Watch the
		meter... Keep the pressure on the
		armrest with your elbow...

He wraps the armrest with tape, cinching it tight.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		It'll squeeze the sensor, duplicate
		the weight of your arm... Okay...
		pick it up.

They look at each other, scared... After a beat, she does.

The meter JIGGLES... but stays in the black! Everyone sighs
with relief. Carson repeats the process on her other armrest.



				CARSON
			(continuing; to Sam)
		Low-tech solution...
			(to Mrs. Han)
		Lean back... Carefully.

Carson feels for the sensor in the seat, finding it buried
under Mrs. Han's thighs. He runs a long piece of tape around
the seat and wraps it tightly.

He tries to lift Mrs. Han, but the meter moves to the red.

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru radio in his pocket)
		How's it going in there?

				CARSON
			(to himself)
		Nag, nag, nag...

He wraps another piece of tape around the seat, and tries
again to lift her. This time it works!

an incredible racket.

Carson is helping Joy get free of her chair. As she stands,
the pieces of her hair stuck to the gum over the microphone
head begin to PULL the gum away!

Mrs. Han sees the meter heading for the red, and the yellow
warning light flashing... She grabs Carson's arm.

Carson quickly covers the mic... The meter drops to zero.

WIDER

The FIRE is spreading across the carpet and walls. Carson is
hurrying everyone out onto the small balcony. He helps Lisa
into the rescue harness. She's terrified.

				CARSON
		You'll be over in five seconds...

She nods. Miranda pulls her across the cable and send the
harness back. Carson turns next to Sam, but he stands back so
his sister can go.

ANGLE ON BOMB

One minute... fifty-nine seconds...

CARSON

sends Sam across... the harness comes back... he straps Mrs.
Han into it...

				CARSON
		Tell 'em I'm gonna release the hook

He pushes her across. As soon as she's there, he gestures to
the Apache Pilot to move closer so he can release the hook.

ANGLE ON BOMB

Thirty seconds... twenty-nine...

THE HARNESS

slides back across to him; Carson grabs it with one hand and
tries to undo the hook buckle with the other...

But the cable is crooked, and the buckle is JAMMED -- if he
can't release it, he's stuck there! Carson tries to free the
hook, but it's dug in between the concrete and the railing.

Fifteen seconds to go...

Carson looks over at the helicopter and waves them away.

				CARSON

		Release the cable from your side!
		Get out of here!

HANGING on the harness next to it...

The helicopter turns and flies away...

The force of the blast HITS them like a tidal wave. The Pilot

Huge chunks of debris, glass, furniture, etc. rain down.

Carson and the section of railing underneath the helicopter
swing like a pendulum from the force of the blast.

Groggy, he loosens his grasp on the harness, and jumps clear
as the helicopter lands.

Miranda leaps out of the Apache and runs to him...

his hand. Mrs. Han and Miranda cry. Joy and Sam grin at him.
After a beat, Carson gathers the kids up in his arms. It is a
profound catharsis for him...

EXT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - P'YÚNGYANG - DAY

General Kai is getting into his car. He look up as an ARMY
OFFICER approaches... and SHOOTS him! The Officer pushes his
body into the passenger's seat, gets in, and drives off.

							FADE THRU TO:

DARKNESS

and the sound of RUNNING WATER.

EXT.  PASTORAL SCENE - DAY

A beautiful ranch house and horse barn, sitting on a meadow
beside a brook, overlooking an unspoiled pine forest.

INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

The pastoral scene is a COMMERCIAL on the TV.

Carson, wrapped in a towel, holds the phone and paces.

				CARSON
			(into phone)
		...I'll call you next week.

Carson hangs up, and CLICKS off the TV as he leaves the room.
The sound of RUNNING WATER continues (OS)...

EXT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - PATIO - NIGHT

Miranda, wearing a bathrobe, is WATERING her sickly roses.
Carson comes outside.

				MIRANDA
		Who was that on the phone?

				CARSON
		The Bureau.
			(beat)
		They want me back on the hostage
		team.

				MIRANDA
		What did you say?

				CARSON
		Told 'em I'd sleep on it...

Miranda smiles, then looks at him, surprised, as he crouches
down and helps her turn the soil around the rose bushes. They
work in silence. Then, tentatively, she leans over and kisses
him. Soon they're in each other's arms, holding tight...

INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Still entwined, Carson and Miranda stumble in. While kissing:

				MIRANDA
		Working with you today was
		certainly... interesting, Inspector.

				CARSON
		It's my outstanding people skills.

He slips her out of her robe and they fall onto the bed. It is
a tender, romantic moment...

Until, (OS), a CAR ALARM goes off. Miranda bolts up.

				MIRANDA
		I hate this fucking town...

Carson ignores the ALARM -- and Miranda's comment. He pushes
her back onto the bed and turns off the bedside lamp.

All of the books and magazines about other places to live
spill from his nightstand, onto the floor...

FADE IN:

EXT.  LOS ANGELES - DAY

The whole dysfunctional megalopolis, beige and blurry in the
summer smog. If this is the American Dream, do me a favor and
wake me up.

EXT.  LAX - DAY

The traffic loop outside the terminals is gridlocked -- mostly
with stretch limousines.

INT.  LAX - (INCLUDE NEWS REPORT MONTAGE) - DAY

Inside, the airport is done up with festive posters, streamers
and banners: Welcome - Pacific Partners Summit

A planeload of cheerful CHINESE DELEGATES come into the
crowded terminal. Some sport red T-shirts with a picture of
Mao wearing Mickey Mouse ears.

They get onto the people mover, passing by a TV REPORTER:

				REPORTER
			(to TV CAMERA)
		Eager to mend its tarnished image,
		Los Angeles has really put out the
		welcome mat for tomorrow's summit.
		The city promises quite a party as
		leaders from Japan, China, South
		Korea, Australia, the U.S. and
		others begin talks for the largest
		free-trade treaty in history.

The SCENE changes to TAPE of DELEGATES from other countries
arriving.

Then, we see massive SECURITY PREPARATIONS all around the city.

				REPORTER (VO)
			(continuing)
		The one sour note is North Korea,
		the only Pacific Rim country not
		participating. There are rumors of
		secret meetings with North Korean
		representatives, but U.S. officials
		insist the North must first hold
		democratic elections, and halt its
		nuclear weapons program -- as they
		claimed to have done back in 1995.

We CUT TO a heated debate in the UN SECURITY COUNCIL.

Then ARTILLERY FIRE over the Korean DMZ.

The SCENE returns to LAX.

				REPORTER (VO)
			(continuing)
		Tensions remain high since last
		year's skirmishes between North Korea
		and the U.S. So any chance of the
		communist North joining the Pacific
		Partners seems highly unlikely.

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  FREMONT PLACE - DAY

An exclusive, walled-off section of Hancock Park. There's only
one route in and out, past a manned guardhouse on Wilshire.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

A Colonial-style mansion, surrounded by an imposing, wrought-
iron fence. There is a bronze plaque, in English and Korean,
next to the entranceway:
     
				Consulate
				 of the
		Democratic People's Republic of Korea

The driveway gate opens and a long, black Mercedes with tinted
windows and diplomatic license plates glides out.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

An alert North Korean CORPORAL watches the perimeter MONITORS.
He pushes a switch to close the gate behind the Mercedes.

EXT.  UTILITY POLE - OLYMPIC BLVD - DAY

From atop a pole outside the south wall, a man with binoculars
overlooks the private streets of Fremont Place.

HIS POV - THROUGH BINOCULARS

as the Mercedes cruises through the quiet neighborhood.

BACK TO SCENE

The man, PAUL JAVAL, is thirtyish, nervous; with short, sandy
hair. He takes the binoculars away from his face and we see
his eyes -- they're a strange, unnaturally light gray.

Javal takes an ORANGE PILL from an unlabeled prescription
bottle and pops it into his mouth. He climbs down the pole to
a van with a phone company logo on it.



EXT.  WILSHIRE BLVD - DAY

The Mercedes comes out of the Fremont Place gate, and turns
into the heavy morning traffic.

INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

It is extremely quiet, due to inch-thick glass on the windows
and 4,000 pounds of armor plating on the car's chassis.

The DRIVER is a North Korean Army Major. On the seat beside
him is an AMD-74, a 5.45x39mm-caliber machine gun.

A HAND from the back seat darts between the front seats and
turns on the RADIO to a ROCK station. The Driver turns it off.

NEW ANGLE

The hand belongs to 10-year-old SAM KE HAN. Sam sits back and
sighs to his sister, JOY (15). Between them sits a middle-aged
Scandinavian GOVERNESS.

				SAM
		I can't stand it -- half an hour to
		get to the stupid school every
		morning... with no music...
			(Korean; subtitled)
		[Just our damn Nanny...]

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

Javal's van, also with tinted windows, turns onto Crenshaw. It
follows the Mercedes, several cars behind it.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Javal, wired, drums on the steering wheel while driving. He
glances at some expertly constructed, radio-control REMOTE
UNITS sitting on the seat next to him.

EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

Traffic is moving at about 35 MPH. The Mercedes merges onto
the freeway, heading west. Javal's van follows.

The thumping of a RAP SONG rattles the other drivers' fillings
as a LOWRIDER with its stereo turned up to "11" cruises by.

INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Even 500 watts of bass cannot penetrate the armored silence.
The Driver scans the road, wary but sensing no danger. He puts
on his blinker to take the 405 South exit.



EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

The van follows, now directly behind the Mercedes, in a
procession of vehicles going up the long, curved overpass
arcing 100 feet above the 10, toward the 405.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

As they approach the crest of the overpass, Javal flips a
switch on his radio-control unit...

CLOSE - ROAD SURFACE OF OVERPASS

Six small SEMICIRCLES, exact replicas of the stay-alert bumps
on the white lines of the overpass, EXPLODE. They spew hundreds
of sharp, triangular nails across the roadway. Immediately,
scores of tires on passing cars BLOW OUT...

WIDER

Causing, 50 yards ahead of the Mercedes and van, the most
hellacious, gut-wrenching, piss-your-pants, chain-reaction
PILE-UP you can imagine.

Dozens of drivers LOSE CONTROL of their vehicles... sideswipe
their neighbors... grind against the guard rails. Some
fishtail into 180's, smashing headlong into the traffic still
coming onto the overpass.

Brakes squeal, people scream, metal crumples, airbags deploy,
glass shatters.

And then it gets really nasty...

A Honda gets jammed under a truck hauling cinder blocks. The
truck JACKKNIFES, tipping over like a drunken giant.

It SMASHES through the concrete wall and guard rail...

Along with several cars and their SCREAMING OCCUPANTS, swept
over the edge by the truck like discarded soda cans.

They plummet through space, CRASHING onto the freeway below.

INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Sam, Joy, and the Governess brace themselves as the Driver
slams on the brakes. He barely avoids hitting anything.

				DRIVER
			(Korean)
		[Stay in the car.]



EXT.  FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY

A nightmare scene of smoke, twisted wrecks, dazed victims. The
Mercedes and van sit motionless in the backed-up traffic.

INT./EXT.  JAVAL'S VAN & ROADWAY - DAY

Javal slides open a TRAP DOOR on the floor of the van. He
slips a wheeled, mechanic's repair platform through it.

ANGLE WITH JAVAL

as, unnoticed amid the chaos, he lies on the platform and
rolls under the Mercedes.

The undercarriage of the Mercedes is armored with steel. Javal
stops at a patch of perforations -- an air exchange vent. He
attaches a slim DEVICE over the vent, flips a switch on it,
then rolls back toward the van.

INT.  MERCEDES - DAY

Oblivious to Javal's actions below them, everyone watches as
police and news helicopters circle above. Then, some CHP
motorcycles straddle the lanes and zoom by.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

Sweating, Javal sits back in the driver's seat and checks
another radio unit. Working.

EXT.  FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY

The CHP has cleared a path through the devastation, and
traffic trickles through. As the Mercedes and the van pass by,
Javal looks proudly at the misery he's wrought. He follows the
Mercedes onto the 405 south.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Javal drives behind the Mercedes, with one hand on the radio
unit. The Mercedes signals to take the Venice exit.

Javal fingers the radio unit, itching to use it...

But he PASSES by the Mercedes as it gets off the freeway.

INSERT ANGLE - UNDER THE MERCEDES

Javal's device is armed, and waiting...

							FADE TO:



EXT.  SIERRA BONITA AVENUE - CARSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A pretty street in the Miracle Mile, lined with neat, single-
family homes. Timed SPRINKLER systems water some of the yards.

Every house on the block except the one we're in front of has
a "For Sale" sign on the lawn. From the weathered looks of the
signs, they've been there for quite a while.

INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

It's a hot night. The ceiling fan above the bed spins slowly.

PETE CARSON tosses restlessly in bed, the sheets half-covering
him. Next to him his wife, MIRANDA KNOLL, snores contentedly.

Carson is in his late thirties, outdoorsy, with a tight,
muscular build. Emotionally he's tightly-wound as well.

Miranda is 35, raven-haired, sensible, pretty. She believes
above all else that one should never raise one's voice.

Carson groans... he's DREAMING...

							CUT TO:

EXT.  BEVERLY DRIVE - (CARSON'S DREAM) - DAY

Quick, SILENT IMAGES: A street cordoned off with police tape.
Cops, SWAT teams, FBI surround BEVERLY THRIFT, a bank.

Carson, younger, hair shorter, sits in an FBI COMMAND TRUCK
across from the bank. Covering the mouthpiece of the phone in
his hand, he's arguing with the OTHER AGENTS in the truck.

Suddenly, a huge, fiery EXPLOSION blows out the front of the
bank building. Horrified, Carson runs toward it...

							CUT TO:

INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM AND HALLWAY - NIGHT

Carson is snapped awake by a CAR ALARM going off outside.

				CARSON
		Son of a bitch!

He bolts out of bed, wearing nothing but a pair of striped
bikini briefs. Miranda rolls over, sleepy, unconcerned...

				MIRANDA
		Pete... please... we have to be up
		early tomorrow. Call the police.



				CARSON
		Yeah, right.

He races down the hall -- right past the house alarm keypad,
its LCD reading "ARMED."

He grabs an aluminum baseball bat from the umbrella stand.
Forgetting to disarm the house alarm, he yanks the front door
open. The house alarm begins SHRIEKING.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		Shit!

MIRANDA

pulls the pillows over her head and sighs.

				MIRANDA
		Not again...

EXT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Carson comes around to the driveway, which is illuminated by
the streetlight --

Where two 20-ish ASSHOLES are sitting in his 1965 Mustang
convertible, their presence courtesy of a huge cut they've
made in the otherwise-perfect ragtop.

Car-theft tools in a leather case between them, they're prying
the ignition switch out of the dashboard.

Asshole #1 spots Carson. He gets out of the car, wielding a
crowbar. His partner keeps working.

NEW ANGLE

Asshole #1 lunges viciously, swiping at Carson with the
crowbar, taking a piece out of his side. Carson starts
BLEEDING profusely, but he's too pissed to notice.

Carson uses his bat to take the offensive. They go at each
other like combatants in a swordfight, the CLANKING of metal
echoing through the neighborhood along with the screaming
house and car ALARMS, and frantic neighborhood DOGS.

Surprised at Carson's fury and strength, Asshole #1 backs onto
the lawn, oblivious to the running SPRINKLERS.

As he backs away, his shoe catches on one of the sprinkler
heads. It breaks off, and a huge GEYSER of water sprays out.

Carson holds his bat in both hands and jams the front of it
into Asshole #1's breadbasket. He doubles over.

Carson grabs Asshole #1's arm, and pulls it quickly against
his raised knee. There is a SNAP and a loud howl as the arm
breaks, and Carson tosses him aside.

Seeing this, Asshole #2 gives up on the car. He takes off
toward the street. Carson runs to head him off, but he's a lot
faster in his Air Jordans than Carson is in his bare feet.

WIDER

Carson grabs the metal lid from a garbage can at the curb and
FLINGS it like a huge Frisbee. It sails across the street --

And NAILS Asshole #2's head. He kisses the pavement, stunned.

Carson runs up and grabs him, but he pulls out a long, sharp
screwdriver and jabs at Carson with it.

Then, blue flashing lights appear from around the corner: A
WESTEC Chevy Blazer. Two uniformed GUARDS get out, and fumble
with their sidearms.

				WESTEC GUARD
		Everybody... chill! Bikini boy! On
		the ground!

Asshole #2 is still trying to gouge Carson with the
screwdriver. Carson glares at the dopey Guards.

				CARSON
		Asshole was trying to boost my car!

ANGLE ACROSS STREET

Carson's fiftyish, black, next-door NEIGHBOR, wearing pajamas
and a robe, comes out of his house. Carson sees him.

				CARSON
		Mike -- call 911!

				NEIGHBOR
		Been trying...
			(has a cordless phone)
		It's busy.
			(to Guards; re Carson)
		He's the good guy, you schumcks.

The Guards seem to get it. Without warning, one takes out a
TASER and ZAPS Asshole #2. Carson lets go just in time.

CLOSER

Holding his bleeding side, Carson walks back to his house. He
notices the "Neighborhood Watch" sign has graffiti spray-
painted on it. He touches it -- the paint is still wet. His
Neighbor shrugs -- whatta ya gonna do?

The PAPER GUY drives by... and tosses Carson's newspaper right
under the gushing SPRINKLER.

				CARSON
		I hate this fuckin' town.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - ESTABLISHING - DAY

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - DAY

Joy is standing on the toilet, blowing cigarette smoke into
the exhaust fan. Someone KNOCKS on the door. She flicks the
cigarette into the toilet, puts a ZIPPO LIGHTER in her pocket.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY

Joy opens the bathroom door. Sam is standing there, grinning.

				JOY
		There are six bathrooms in this
		house, Sam.

				SAM
			(fanning the air)
		But only one with a smoking section.

She quickly closes the door behind her. Sam laughs.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DINING ROOM - DAY

Sam and Joy sit at the table. AMBASSADOR HAN and MRS. HAN are
having breakfast: radish soup, kimchi and grilled fish.

Ambassador Han reads through the morning's faxed communiquÈs.
He's 43, rarely smiles, and hates living in the U.S. He's
dressed in an impeccably-tailored, Valentino two-piece suit.

Mrs. Han is slender, soft-spoken, but as iron-willed as her
husband. She, however, is quick to smile. She's wearing a
summery dress with a white sweater over her shoulders.

Ambassador Han pulls the front of Sam's shirt to reveal the
"Nirvana" logo on his T-shirt.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(Korean)
		[Go change.]

Ambassador Han's X-ray stare turns to Joy.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(continuing)
		[You smell like a fireplace.]

A BUTLER appears with a phone. He WHISPERS to Mrs. Han.

				MRS. HAN
		It's the Governess...
			(into phone)
		Hello, Hilda...

CUTAWAY - CLOSE ON GOVERNESS

as she speaks into a cellular phone. She's extremely nervous.
We cannot see her surroundings.

				GOVERNESS
			(thru phone)
		Mrs. Han... I am very sick today...

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DINING ROOM - DAY

				MRS. HAN
			(into phone)
		We will see you next week...
			(hangs up; smiles to kids)
		It appears I'll be taking you to
		school.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

In the back of his van, Javal pats the Governess' hand.

				JAVAL
		Very good. You may go now...

He speaks with a slight accent, French, perhaps. He pops an
orange pill, then unlatches the rear doors of the van. With a
quick glance back at him, she goes to open the doors.

Javal grabs a plastic tarp and throws it over the Governess'
upper body. He puts his arm across her neck, flicks open a
gravity knife and PLUNGES it through the tarp, into her chest.

He drops her on the floor of the van and fastidiously wipes a
small smudge of blood from his hand with a handkerchief.

INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BATHROOM AND BEDROOM - DAY

Carson steps out of the shower. He looks exhausted. Toweling
off, he goes into the bedroom, where Miranda is riding an
exercise bike, listening to music on headphones and reading
the sprinkler-soaked newspaper, all while watching the TV.

ANGLE ON TV

A perky blonde traffic reporter, BOBBI MARCHFELDER, talks to
us from a local NEWS COPTER.



				BOBBI
			(on TV)
		...Good morning, Summit Day! It's
		gonna be the Super Bowl, the 4th of
		July, the Olympics and Woodstock all
		rolled into one! All over town
		there'll be parades, concerts,
		rallies, festivals... So get out
		there everyone, but plan your drive-
		time accordingly! This is Bobbi
		Marchfelder, your Eye in the Sky...

We CUT TO the White House lawn, where the PRESIDENT is about
to board a helicopter.

				MORNING ANCHOR (VO)
			(on TV)
		The President is on his way...

				PRESIDENT
			(on TV)
		...It's an honor hosting my fellow
		leaders in Los Angeles, the capitol
		city of the Pacific Rim...

We CUT BACK to the studio and the MORNING ANCHOR.

				MORNING ANCHOR
			(on TV)
		We'll see the menu for Mayor
		Simpson's Brentwood barbecue, right
		after this...

We CUT TO a MUSICAL MONTAGE of preparations for the events
around town.

BACK TO SCENE

As the MUSIC swells, Carson turns the TV off.

				MIRANDA
		I was watching that.

				CARSON
		If I hear one more Beach Boys song,
		I'll shoot myself.

Miranda points at the headphones -- she can't hear him.

				CARSON
			(continuing; while smiling)
		I said, if we were having sex once in
		a while, you wouldn't need to ride
		that fucking bike every morning.



				MIRANDA
			(hasn't heard a thing)
		Be right with you...

As Carson dresses, we get a LOOK at their bedroom -- Miranda's
nightstand has two neat stacks of periodicals on it, with Los
Angeles magazine and Psychology Today on the top of them.

Carson's nightstand is overflowing with books and magazines
about other cities and states: Wonderland Washington;
Magnificent Oregon; Welcome to North Carolina."

INT./EXT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - PATIO & KITCHEN - DAY

Miranda, dressed in a conservative skirt, jacket, black shoes,
is out on the patio. Her breakfast -- a bowl of fruit and
wheat germ -- sits on the patio table while she waters some
sickly-looking ROSE BUSHES in a planter.

Carson, dressed in shirt and tie, looking beat, fries a steak
and three eggs in butter. He comes outside with his breakfast
and a magazine article: "American Expatriates in New Zealand."

				MIRANDA
			(looks him over)
		Have you gotten any sleep lately?

				CARSON
			(ignores the question)
		Shop's gonna tow the car in --
		goddamn ignition's trashed.

				MIRANDA
		Take mine. I'll ride in with Diane.

Carson watches as she carefully picks the dead leaves off the
rose bushes.

				CARSON
		You ask me, those suckers are a lost
		cause.

She continues, then glances at the article Carson is reading.

				MIRANDA
		It's not for you.

				CARSON
		You mean it's not for you.

				MIRANDA
		I don't chase car thieves in my
		underwear. C'mon, you'd die of
		boredom if we ever sold this house
		and moved.



				CARSON
		I'd die of shock, from finding
		anyone dumb enough to buy the place.
		Even for what it's worth now.

				MIRANDA
		Lots of people bought at the top of
		the market...

				CARSON
		That sure cheers me right up.

				MIRANDA
		I don't know why we even talk about
		it. The city's not the problem. So
		we move. It wouldn't matter. What's
		that saying: "Wherever you go, there
		you are."

Carson just looks at her. Reaching for the salt, he winces
from the cut in his side.

				MIRANDA
			(continuing)
		I hope you're current on your
		tetanus booster. Was it worth it?

				CARSON
		One cut... two assholes in the
		hospital... Yep.

Carson glances at his watch and gets up.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		Well, another day of baby-sitting my
		favorite bunch of people...

He grabs a Bianchi shoulder holster with a Sig-Sauer P-229,
9mm pistol, straps it on, then pulls on a blue windbreaker.
Emblazoned on the back are large yellow letters: FBI.

				MIRANDA
		Ask for a transfer.

				CARSON
		They're not gonna transfer me. You
		know damn well why I was bumped down
		to guard duty...
			(as he's leaving)
		My outstanding people skills.

Miranda tries to return to tending her roses. But instead, she
sadly watches him go.



EXT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - DAY

A look of sorrow crosses Carson's face as he watches some
YOUNG KIDS laugh and shove, getting onto a school bus.

He then glances at his wounded Mustang, parked in the street.
He spots something on the windshield: A pink parking ticket.

The parking sign above the graffiti-stained Neighborhood Watch
sign reads: Street Cleaning - Friday 8-10 AM.

				CARSON
		I hate this fuckin' town.

Carson CHIRPS open Miranda's car: a red Volvo 960.

As he pulls away, we SEE a bumper sticker on the car: a circle
and slash through cartoon weapons on one side, cartoon teddy
bears on the other, and "Arms Are For Hugging" in between.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

The Driver backs the Mercedes out of the garage behind the
Consulate. We notice there is ANOTHER MERCEDES parked inside.

Mrs. Han, Sam and Joy come outside. They hear some heartfelt
SWEARING:

				ANGRY VOICE (OS)
		Goddamn Limey overpriced piece a
		shit...

THEIR POV

In the driveway across the street, a man in a business suit
has his head under the hood of a brand-new Jaguar convertible.
The JAG OWNER's 15-year-old, blonde daughter, LISA, sits in
the car with her schoolbooks in her lap.

JOY

turns to Mrs. Han:

				JOY
		Can we give Lisa a ride?

INT./EXT.  MERCEDES - DAY

It pulls into the driveway across the street. The Jag Owner is
still SWEARING mightily. Lisa climbs into the Mercedes.

				LISA
		Hey, Joy... Sam...

Joy rolls the window up and the SOUND of cursing disappears.



				LISA
			(continuing)
		Excellent -- I can't hear him!

				SAM
			(raps on window)
		The glass is an inch thick.
			(points to doors, roof)
		Armor-plated. Bulletproof. Bomb-
		proof.

				LISA
		Perfect car for L.A.
			(looks back at her Dad)
		Starts, too.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

As the Mercedes travels its usual route down Crenshaw, Javal's
van begins following it.

INSERT ANGLE - UNDER THE MERCEDES

where Javal's DEVICE is attached, still waiting...

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

A dark-green government Dodge pulls up and parks behind one
just like it on a paved area near the Consulate gate.

DAVE JUAREZ, (chubby, 40, Mexican-American, a desk jockey) gets
out of the Dodge and hangs an FBI shield over his top pocket.

He glances over at North Korean Security Chief COLONEL LEE,
(45), who has paused inside the gate to regard Dave, and the
outside world, with profound contempt.

Dave, attachÈ case in one hand and notebook computer in the
other, walks to a 10-by-15 detached guardhouse on the far
corner of the property, just outside the high fence.

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Inside are two desks and four chairs, a console of
communication equipment, a microwave and a Mr. Coffee.

Dave enters. Two FBI agents, finishing their shift, gather
their belongings: ROBBINS (late 20's; male; thinning hair) and
SABATINI, (early 30's; cute; dark, bobbed hair; female).

They wear blue FBI blazers and have standard-FBI-issue 10mm
Heckler & Koch MP-5 machine pistols in oversized shoulder
rigs. Dave is in civilian clothes, and is not armed.



				ROBBINS
		Yo, Dave the Computer Man! Actually
		escaped the office!

				DAVE
		I'm doin' field upgrades. Gives 'em
		a chance to hose out my cage.

He glances through the window at Colonel Lee.

				DAVE
			(continuing)
		Who's the fuckin' gargoyle?

				ROBBINS
		Their Chief of Security, Colonel Lee.

Sabatini makes the jerk-off sign with her hand.

				SABATINI
		"Chuckles," as we're inclined to
		call him.
			(yawns; flops in a chair)
		Friggin' graveyard shift...

				ROBBINS
		Love to know what dope made it the
		Bureau's job to give full-time
		protection to foreign consulates.
			(offers coffee to Dave)
		Cup a mud?

				DAVE
		Not if you made it. Why don't you
		get Sabatini to brew the java? She's
		the alleged chick.

				SABATINI
		Blow me.

				DAVE
		Where's Carson?

				SABATINI
		On his way. Some creeps tried to rip
		off his Mustang last night.
			(beat; solemnly)
		They cut the ragtop.

				DAVE
		Motherfuckers...

Dave takes three PCMCIA computer cards from his attachÈ case.



				DAVE
			(continuing)
		Latest and greatest. Wireless
		network link-ups.

				SABATINI
		Whoa, slow down, I'm gonna pee.

				ROBBINS
		Me, too.

				DAVE
		Ingrates.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

The van drives in the lane alongside the Mercedes.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

HUMMING, Javal drives with one hand, while tapping with his
other on the top of the radio-controlled remote box.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

As they approach the light at Washington Blvd, just turning
yellow, Javal's van gets in front of the Mercedes.

Their lanes stop for the red light. A FRUIT VENDOR holding a
bag of oranges walks from car to car.

Javal slips the van into neutral and lets it roll back until
his rear bumper taps gently against the Mercedes' front bumper.

INT.  MERCEDES - INCLUDE POV THROUGH REAR VIEW MIRROR - DAY

The Driver hits the HORN. The van doesn't move. The Driver
glances in the rear-view:

There's a Jeep Cherokee tight on his tail, and the BLACK LADY
in it is busy dealing with a carpool full of 8-year-old KIDS.

The Driver looks at Mrs. Han, who's peering out the side
window, fascinated by the African-American-themed storefronts.
They're all festooned with Summit-related banners, and SHOP
OWNERS are preparing for a community sidewalk bazaar.

Sam, bored, stuffs several pieces of GUM into his mouth.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - SAME

Javal flips the switch on his radio-controlled remote.



INSERT

Under the Mercedes, the device Javal planted there begins to
emit thick, white CS TEAR GAS.

INT.  MERCEDES - DAY

The GAS pours in through the ventilation system. Everyone
inside starts coughing and choking uncontrollably. The Driver
grabs his AMD-74 machine gun and pops the door locks.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

The Driver, Mrs. Han, Joy, Sam and Lisa pile out of the car.

Jittering with excitement, fear and speed, Javal hops out of
his van, holding a Benelli M-1, a semi-automatic shotgun.

He SHOOTS the Driver in the chest. The BLAST from the shotgun
muzzle, however, is unlike anything we've ever seen before: it
is blindingly BRIGHT, even in broad daylight, belching a huge
cluster of glowing, white-hot magnesium.

The Driver flies back against the Mercedes, EMPTYING his
machine gun into the air. The wound in his chest is full of
BURNING magnesium shrapnel.

WIDER

The other drivers in the intersection see this and go
completely nuts. Some duck for cover under their dashboards.
Others peel away. A few COLLIDE with oncoming traffic.

The Carpool Lady in the Cherokee pushes the kids down on the
floor. The Fruit Vendor hides by rolling under a car.

Sam and Joy are incapacitated by tear-gas coughing fits. Mrs.
Han stumbles toward them, trying to get them to run away.
Javal PUNCHES her, knocking her down.

He turns to Lisa, surprised to see her. Sweating, he points
the shotgun at her... almost pulls the trigger... then notices
Mrs. Han's expression of horror and thinks the better of it.

He spots a MOTORIST in a Ford Escort, peering cautiously over
his dashboard to get a look at the action.

Javal SHOOTS the Motorist through the windshield with another
bright, searing blast of magnesium. The Motorist and the
entire front of his car burst into FLAMES.

Mrs. Han is on her knees, sobbing. Javal grabs her by the arm
and pulls her to the back of the van. He opens the doors.



				JAVAL
		You see that I'm serious in my
		intention, yes?
			(she nods)
		If you cooperate, you and your
		children will be home for dinner
		tonight.

He tightens his grip on her. She nods again, then looks at the
kids. Javal shoves her, Sam, Joy and Lisa into the van.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

He grabs three pairs of handcuffs off a C-shaped bar welded on
both ends to the inside of the van. He handcuffs one of Mrs.
Han's arms, passes the chain through the bar, then handcuffs
the other. He does the same with Sam; then handcuffs one of
Joy's arms, passes the chain through and attaches the other
handcuff to Lisa.

Javal hops in his seat and drives away on Washington.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

Several people, including the Carpool Lady, rush over to the
Driver, who lies DEAD and SMOLDERING on the ground.

His hand is halfway inside his bloody pants pocket, holding a
small plastic card with the Consulate's phone number on it.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Colonel Lee and a North Korean Army OFFICER come running out.
ANOTHER OFFICER starts up a car in the back of the house.

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Robbins and Sabatini see the commotion and go to investigate.
Dave follows.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Ambassador Han runs out. He has a stricken look on his face.

				COLONEL LEE
			(Korean; to Ambassador Han)
		[You must stay here.]

Ambassador Han nods. The FBI agents run up. To them:

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		Someone took my family!

The agents look at each other -- holy shit! Colonel Lee's car
SCREECHES to a stop. Sabatini stands in front of it.



				SABATINI
		You got no jurisdiction outside
		this property!

Colonel Lee shoves a big, ugly Tokorev 7.62x25mm-caliber
pistol in her face as he's opening the car door.

				SABATINI
			(continuing)
		Shit!
			(to Ambassador Han)
		Yank his fuckin' leash!

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		My men are going!

Colonel Lee jumps into the car and it screeches away, almost
running Sabatini over.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(continuing; to Sabatini)
		It's a white telephone van, driving
		west on Washington Boulevard.

The agents rush back to their guardhouse. Dave's government
Dodge is blocking theirs.

				ROBBINS
		Keys!

Dave tosses them to Robbins. Sabatini shoves Dave into the
back seat. He looks at her, dumbfounded.

				SABATINI
		You're ridin' shotgun.

INT.  DAVE'S DODGE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Dave is thrown against the back of the seat by the ACCELERATION.

				ROBBINS
		Cherry?

				DAVE
		Under the seat.

Sabatini grabs the red flashing light, puts it on the dashboard.

				ROBBINS
		Siren?

				DAVE
		I don't know! I'm never in a fuckin'
		hurry..!



EXT.  FREMONT PLACE - DAY

Just as they race out of Fremont Place past the guard gate,
Carson, in Miranda's Volvo, comes in on the other side.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson sees the agents in the Dodge and floors the Volvo. He
fishtails, making a U-turn.

He straddles the lanes on Wilshire to pull up next to them.
All the cars in front of them swerve to clear out of the way.

He rolls down his window. Sabatini shouts over to him:

				SABATINI
		Someone snatched Han's family! White
		phone van, westbound on Washington!

Carson looks like he's been punched in the stomach.

				CARSON
		Give me a secure radio!

Sabatini takes a small two-way MOTOROLA RADIO out of her
pocket and throws it through her window to Carson. Dropping it
in his lap, he punches the gas. Robbins floors Dave's piece-of-
shit Dodge, trying to keep up.

EXT.  FEDERAL BUILDING, WESTWOOD - ESTABLISHING - DAY

INT.  FEDERAL BUILDING - STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICES - DAY

Diplomatic Liaison EARL WALTHER is using the reflection in his
office window to adjust his necktie. Walther is 30, good-
looking, black; a GS lifer working his way up the ranks by
virtue of his quiet competence.

A CO-WORKER sticks his head into the office, then shields his
eyes from the sight of Walther's sharp new suit.

				CO-WORKER
		Someone's been to Nordstroms, big
		time.

				WALTHER
		Clothes make the man.

				CO-WORKER
		But does the man make enough for the
		clothes?

				WALTHER
			(smiles)
		The man makes payments on his Visa.

Walther's SECRETARY rushes in.



				SECRETARY
		Mr. Walther... priority line!

				WALTHER
			(into phone)
		This is Diplomatic Liaison Earl
		Walther... What's the nature of your
		emer --
			(grimaces)
		Aw, Jesus... not today...
			(beat)
		I'll inform channels and get a copter
		in the air. For God's sake, keep it
		quiet. Do what you can, but don't
		endanger civilians or the family!

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson drives with one hand, while holding the radio.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		You bet -- nice and easy.

Real easy, until he narrowly MISSES a bunch of cars when
SCREECHING around a corner.

INT.  FEDERAL BUILDING - STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICES - DAY

Walther presses the intercom button on the phone.

				WALTHER
			(into phone)
		Get the Secretary of State on the
		horn.
			(listens)
		I know he left already. I'm familiar
		with the concept of time zones. Find
		his ass.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson turns the frequency on his two-way.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Robbins, Sabatini... Chopper's on
		its way.

EXT.  WASHINGTON BLVD - DAY

Driving skillfully, Carson edges past the North Koreans.



INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

And then, Carson can't believe it: he spots Javal's van, a
couple blocks ahead, driving at normal speed.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Check it out! Ahead, on the right!

				SABATINI (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Think it's them?

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Yeah... but it seems too easy... I'll
		move up; he won't suspect a civilian
		car. Stay back, then get on his ass
		when I signal. We'll box him in.

He looks over at Colonel Lee, whose car is pacing his.

				CARSON
			(continuing; into radio)
		If the Mod Squad gets in your way,
		don't be shy about getting 'em out.

				SABATINI (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Copy that one.

INT.  COLONEL LEE'S CAR - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Glaring, Colonel Lee looks over at the FBI cars as they pass.

INT.  DAVE'S DODGE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Sabatini pulls out her machine pistol, and tosses the two-way
to Dave. He looks scared, and carsick.

				SABATINI
		Don't puke... I hate when guys puke!

EXT.  WASHINGTON BLVD - DAY

Carson tries to approach Javal without drawing his attention.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

He still drives at the same speed as the surrounding traffic.

HIS POV

As Carson nonchalantly passes, Javal NOTICES the government-
issue two-way radio sitting on the seat of Carson's Volvo.



JAVAL

grins... it's show-time. He STOMPS on the gas.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Pissed that he's been made, Carson speeds up.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Driving fast, Javal makes a hard right. As the van leans with
the turn, something rolls out from under a sheet of canvas on
the floor -- the Governess' BODY, bloodied and grotesque under
the plastic tarp it's wrapped in.

Joy starts SCREAMING, as does everyone else when they see it.

Javal pulls out a Beretta Centurion 9mm pistol and FIRES a
deafening round through the roof of the van.

				JAVAL
		I need to concentrate!

EXT.  WASHINGTON BLVD - DAY

During a lull in traffic, a WELL-DRESSED WOMAN jaywalks across
the street. An LAPD black-and-white changes lanes and puts on
its flashing lights. As two COPS write her a ticket...

Around the corner TWO MEN make a quick exchange of money and a
vial of crack.

NEW ANGLE

The Cops do notice Javal speeding by, with Carson's Volvo, the
FBI Dodge and Colonel Lee's car in hot pursuit. They shove the
ticket in the Well-Dressed Woman's hand and hop in their car.

EXT.  LA CIENEGA BLVD / SIDE STREETS - DAY

Javal turns onto the side streets -- rows of run-down
apartment buildings. He takes a circuitous route, gaining a
one-block lead on Carson and the others.

Then, he makes a sudden turn into a one-way alley.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Javal hits a remote garage door opener. Ahead, rickety doors
on one of a line of detached garages facing the alley OPEN up.

Across from the garage, parked parallel against the back of an
empty building, we notice a duplicate van. It's facing the
same direction as Javal is driving.

Javal slams on the brakes, stopping just past the garage, and
then quickly backs up into the garage.

INT.  ALLEYWAY GARAGE / JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

As he pulls in, we catch GLIMPSES of the van slipping backwards
into a FIBERGLASS SUPERSTRUCTURE that fits tightly around the
rear two-thirds of it. As the van comes to a stop, several snap-
buckles on the edge of the superstructure spring closed.

Javal reaches out the van window and pulls on a rope hanging
from the ceiling of the garage. The rope releases the door
from the opening mechanism, so it immediately falls CLOSED.

Then, Javal turns several switches on another of his neatly-
constructed remotes:

INT.  DUPLICATE VAN - SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY

Steel straps are holding the steering wheel rigid.

A set of relays, triggered remotely, start the engine;

Engage the transmission;

And supply fuel to the carburetor.

EXT.  ALLEYWAYS

The duplicate van takes off down the alley. Just as it gets up
to speed, Carson and the others round the corner into the alley
behind it. As far as they know, they're still chasing Javal.

The alley is several blocks long, running parallel to the main
road, separated at each block by perpendicular streets. The
duplicate van races along, scraping against parked cars and
the rear walls of buildings...

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		He's gonna wrap it around something!

EXT.  ALLEYWAYS - DAY

Indeed, as the duplicate van crosses a street, cars swerve to
avoid hitting it. It continues into the next alley.

Up ahead, a garbage truck lumbers into the far end of the
alley, its metal lift-rods extended to pick up a dumpster.

				CARSON (OS)
		Oh, shit...

The duplicate van CRASHES into the garbage truck and EXPLODES.



NEW ANGLE

Carson, horrified, jumps out of his car. Robbins and Sabatini
run up. They have to hold Carson away from the burning van.
Dave hurries to the back of a building and gets sick.

Colonel Lee, wide-eyed with anger, gets in Carson's face.

				COLONEL LEE
		You should not have interfered!

Carson shoves Colonel Lee out of his way, hard.

				CARSON
		I'm in no mood...

Colonel Lee comes back, ready for a fight. Carson is happy to
oblige, but Robbins grabs Carson's arm.

				ROBBINS
		Forget about him!

By now, ONLOOKERS have begun to gather, as LAPD black-and
whites and helicopters converge on the area.

EXT.  ALLEYWAY GARAGE - DAY

A block away, the garage door opens, and we hear something
eerie and unexpected: a scratchy, music-box kids' SONG, coming
from a loudspeaker.

Javal's van pulls out and we see its TRANSFORMATION: The
superstructure surrounding the body of the van makes it look
like a graffiti-covered, unlicensed ice cream vendor.

EXT.  ALLEYWAYS - DAY

The entrance of the alley is blocked by a black-and-white. So,
accompanied by the SONG, Javal drives along the one-way alley
in his camouflaged van, passing unnoticed by the authorities.

Anguished, Carson is staring at the BURNING duplicate van...

							CUT TO:

EXT.  BEVERLY DRIVE - (FLASHBACK) - DAY

Beverly Thrift EXPLODES and BURNS...

							CUT TO:

EXT.  ALLEYWAYS - DAY

Carson tries to shake the memory away. He looks around, sensing
that something isn't right, then turns to the other agents.



				CARSON
		Let's get back to the Consulate.

Off their perplexed looks, we

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

One room, bathroom and kitchenette. A laptop computer and
peripherals are on a table, along with some cell phones, a
toolbox, and some jumbles of electronic circuitry.

In the main room, there are three large Lazy-Boy easy chairs,
side by side, facing a 27-inch TV on a stand. A cloth covers
two OBJECTS sitting atop the TV.

The door opens. Mrs. Han, Joy, Sam, and Lisa walk in, rigid
with fear. Javal, Beretta 9mm in hand, comes in behind them
and closes the door. Javal strips off his sweat-soaked shirt
and wipes his face with it. Mrs. Han realizes he's wired to
the moon... and it terrifies her.

				JAVAL
		Does anyone need to use the rest
		room? This will be your last
		opportunity for a few hours.
			(no takers)
		Very well. Mrs. Han, Sam, Joy,
		please sit here.
			(indicates the Lazy Boys;
			then turns to Lisa)
		And you... what is your name?

				LISA
			(after a beat)
		Lisa...

Still holding the Beretta, he grabs a polo shirt from the
closet and pulls it on. As the family sits in the chairs:

				JAVAL
		No, Mrs. Han, this one. Thank you.

He takes a pair of handcuffs out of his pants pocket. He tries
to handcuff Lisa, hands behind her back, but she resists.

				JAVAL
			(continuing; sotto)
		You afford me some additional
		bargaining power. But not much.

She wilts. Javal cuffs her to the handles of the refrigerator.
He puts a strip of duct tape from his tool box across her mouth.

He uncovers one of the items atop the TV: An electronic box with
three pairs of oversized, LED VU meters on the front of it.

We NOTICE neat lines of wires running from each of the chairs
up into it. Javal flips one of a row of switches on it; a
green light and the meters come to life.

				JAVAL
			(continuing)
		There. No taping your mouths, no
		restraints. Please remain still
		while I explain. The meters on the
		left indicate sound pressure --
		Decibels. There are microphones on
		your chair backs. If you raise your
		voices above certain level, putting
		your meter in the red zone for more
		than one sustained second, the
		circuit will be closed.
			(beat)
		The right meters indicate motion.
		There are pressure sensors inside the
		armrests and seats. The sensors don't
		like to get wet, so I hope you were
		honest about not needing to use the
		loo. If you make any excess
		movements, or try to leave your
		chair, the circuit will be closed.

				MRS. HAN
		I don't understand...

She looks at her sound meter, which jumped close to the red.

				MRS. HAN
			(continuing; softly)
		What happens if the circuit closes?

				JAVAL
		Kaboom...

He uncovers the other item atop the TV -- a one-pound brick of
C-4 high explosive with the detonation mechanism jammed into
it. Mrs. Han gasps and begins to PANIC.

				JAVAL
			(continuing)
		Easy... deep breath...
			(to the kids)
		Do each of you understand?

They nod. Tears roll down Joy's face.

				JAVAL
			(continuing)
		Keep your wits, and all will be fine.

He flips another switch and the green light turns yellow. He
then turns on the TV. COVERAGE of the Summit is everywhere.

				COMMENTATOR #1
			(on TV)
		...Not since the '84 Olympics has the
		whole city had an such an opportunity --

Javal turns the channel to a SOAP, and MUTES it. He starts
pacing, and glances at his watch. It's 9:15 AM.

INT.  GOVERNMENT HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Earl Walther looks through the window as his copter lands on
the lawn behind the North Korean Consulate.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

As the copter lands, Carson comes out to meet Walther.

				WALTHER
		Carson?
			(Carson nods)
		Walther. Who told the Ambassador?

				CARSON
		His Security Chief.
			(beat)
		There was a civilian with them --
		fifteen-year-old girl from across
		the street. We're trying to reach
		the parents.

				WALTHER
		Goddamn it...
			(sotto)
		Look, Mrs. Han was the North Korean
		Premier's niece! We're hearing
		rumors they're gonna make a major
		issue out of what happened here...

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY

Carson and Walther come into the house. We hear only the
TICKING of the grandfather clock in the foyer.

Colonel Lee and his Officers stand by the stairs; Robbins,
Sabatini and Dave stand together near the front door.

				CARSON
		I'm not so sure what happened here.
		Something smells. Asshole was acting
		like he wanted us to spot him...



				WALTHER
		What the hell are you talking about?

				AMBASSADOR HAN (OS)
		Mr. Walther?

Ambassador Han comes down the stairs, his face tight with
repressed emotion.

				WALTHER
		Ambassador Han... my deepest --

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		-- I have no wish for condolences.
		Just answers.

				WALTHER
		As soon as we have any to give...

Suddenly, the Butler sprints across the foyer. He shoves the
cordless phone into Ambassador Han's hands.

Ambassador Han listens to the phone, then takes in a sharp
breath and sits on the steps.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(into phone)
		Yoon..?!

				CARSON
			(to FBI agents)
		Start a trace!

Carson is elated. Robbins, Sabatini and Dave rush out. Walther
pulls out a cell phone and hits a speed-dial key.

				WALTHER
			(into phone)
		Mr. Secretary... they're alive!

				COLONEL LEE
			(to Carson; incensed)
		You are tapping our phones?!

				CARSON
			(while crossing to
			Ambassador Han)
		Yeah, you didn't know. And I'm Meryl
		Streep.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

Javal is holding his cell phone next to Mrs. Han's face.



				MRS. HAN
			(into phone)
		We are not hurt. But this man is
		very serious --

He pulls the phone from her, takes a breath to compose himself.

				JAVAL
			(into phone)
		I want you to remember the feeling
		you had when you thought your family
		was dead, and use it to inform the
		choices you're about to make.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY

				CARSON
		Say you want to talk to the kids...

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(into phone)
		I need to know my children are all
		right.

				JAVAL (VO)
			(thru phone)
		Be in front of a television in two
		minutes. Tune it to channel four.
		You'll get the picture.

Javal hangs up. Stunned, Ambassador Han stands up.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		There is a television in my office.

As Carson, Ambassador Han, Colonel Lee and Walther hurry to
the office in the back of the house, Carson's radio crackles:

				ROBBINS (VO)
			(thru radio)
		We're screwed on the trace -- he's
		on a cell phone.

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Dave and Robbins watch Sabatini work the comm console.

				DAVE
		Play the tape back. I might be able
		to pull the electronic serial number
		out of the subcarrier.

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Ask Dave if he knows how to find the
		phone's serial number.

				ROBBINS
			(smiles; into radio)
		Hey, great idea...

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Ambassador Han turns on the TV to channel 4.

ANGLE ON TV

It's the same medical SOAP that's on at the apartment -- a
DOCTOR and NURSE are screwing in a deserted operating room.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

Javal is standing in the kitchenette, pointing a DIGITAL STILL
CAMERA at the family. It FLASHES as he takes a picture.

CLOSER

There is a cable running from Javal's computer to his cell
phone. He hooks another cable to the digital camera, and an
IMAGE appears on the screen of his laptop. He clicks on "SEND."

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Everyone stares expectantly at the TV. They turn as the fax
machine on the credenza RINGS. An IMAGE begins to emerge from
the machine: the picture from Javal's digital camera.

CLOSE ON FAXED PICTURE

It shows the Han family sitting in their booby-trapped chairs
in front of the TV. The explosives and the electronics are
clearly visible atop the set, as is the program on the TV.

				CARSON (OS)
		Oh, Jesus, those're explosives!
			(beat)
		Look at the TV -- this was just
		taken.

BACK TO SCENE

A second page on the fax begins to come through. As it does,
the telephone RINGS. Carson and Colonel Lee both go for the
extension near the sofa; Carson grabs it first. Ambassador Han
picks up the phone on his desk.



				JAVAL (VO)
			(thru phone)
		There must surely be several people
		in the room; you may put me on the
		speakerbox if you wish.

Ambassador Han clicks on the SPEAKERBOX. Carson and the others
look at the second faxed page: a list of instructions.

				JAVAL (VO)
			(continuing; thru
			speakerbox)
		I am not a terrorist. Your
		countries' political posturing means
		nothing to me. So do not waste time
		trying to negotiate.
			(beat)
		The Federal Reserve Bank of Los
		Angeles can furnish ten million
		dollars U.S. by 2:00 PM. The
		required denominations are in the
		instructions, as is the method of
		packaging. Be in your car at 3:00
		PM, and drive north on Highland
		Avenue. I will call with where to
		leave the money, which you will do
		at 3:30. If I am unmolested, I will
		call again at 4:00 with the family's
		location and the method for removing
		them from their... predicament.
		Could you please refer to page one?
			(they look at the photo)
		Any deviation from these instructions
		and my device will fulfill its
		function at exactly 5:00 PM.

CLICK. Ambassador Han looks around, feeling totally helpless.
Carson says nothing, trying not to show how uneasy he feels.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(to Walther)
		P'yÚngyang must approve the ransom...

				WALTHER
		Of course. The FBI's top Hostage
		Negotiator is on the way --

				CARSON
		-- Goddamn Negotiator's the last
		thing we need! This asshole sound
		like he was interested in bargaining?

Walther glares at Carson, then continues to Ambassador Han:


				WALTHER
		We have people who are experts in
		these situations. We really feel it
		would be best if you let them
		coordinate everything...

Numb, Ambassador Han nods.

				WALTHER
			(continuing; to Carson)
		Let's get on it...

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Robbins, Sabatini and Dave look up as Carson and Walther enter.

				CARSON
		...You're gonna just pay up, count
		on his good nature to return the
		family?!

				WALTHER
		It's the President's intention to
		keep this quiet, move forward with
		the Summit, and work with the North
		Koreans. Jesus, you've already
		embarrassed the shit out of us over
		the phone surveillance --

				CARSON
		-- They know their phones are tapped!
		They tap our fucking phones!

				WALTHER
		That's not the point! The point is
		not acknowledging it!
			(beat)
		We got an international incident
		brewing, with a country we were
		practically at war with last year!
		Our best Negotiator is gonna run
		point. If you got a problem, you can
		take the goddamn rest of the day off.

				CARSON
		This Consulate is my responsibility.

				WALTHER
		Not any more.

Carson is stunned. (OS), we hear a CHOPPER approaching.



				WALTHER
			(continuing)
		That's the Negotiator. You do the
		briefing.

Carson shoots a disgusted look at the others, then leaves.

							CUT TO:

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Carson turns off the Beach Boys SONG on the TV behind him.

Holding Javal's faxes, he's facing Ambassador Han, Colonel Lee
and the Hostage Negotiator (whom we don't yet see.)

				CARSON
		...Our worst enemy'll be the city.
		There are events gearing up all
		around town, and a dozen world
		leaders arriving. Add the Friday
		rush hour and usual L.A. bad
		behavior and it'll be a nightmare
		out there by 3 PM. It all works to
		the advantage of the kidnapper,
		hinders our pursuit efforts...
			(frowns)
		You don't agree?

WIDER


The Negotiator stands and takes the faxes from Carson.


It's Miranda, his wife. Her FBI shield-holder is folded over
the breast pocket of her jacket.

				MIRANDA
		I'm wondering whether to believe him
		when he says he's strictly motivated
		by money.

				CARSON
			(grabs faxes back)
		You see one word of Peoples'-
		Liberation, Holy-Jihad, Revolutionary
		whatever-it-is-we're-pissed-off-about-
		this-week bullshit in this entire
		letter?

				MIRANDA
		I still want to check the MO against
		known politicals, terrorists --



				CARSON
		-- Already doing it. We're
		coordinating with the Secret
		Service, the NSA and the CIA.

				MIRANDA
		Have someone talk to the LAPD, give
		them a cover story for the media
		about the crash on La Cienega.

Walther comes in and looks at Carson.

				WALTHER
		Why didn't you tell me Doctor Knoll
		is your wife?!

This surprises Ambassador Han and Colonel Lee.

				CARSON
			(while looking at Miranda)
		If she'd changed her name when we
		got married, I wouldn't have to.

				MIRANDA
			(to Carson)
		I'm so enjoying this opportunity to
		finally work together...

				WALTHER
		Jesus, forget I asked.
			(beat)
		The cash will be here in an hour.
			(to Miranda)
		Any thoughts on the kidnapper's
		thoughts?

				MIRANDA
		Everything indicates he's working
		alone. And his concerns do seem to
		be solely about the money... so I
		agree that he's only using the
		Summit and the tension with North
		Korea to create extreme motivation
		to pay the ransom.

				COLONEL LEE
		I will bring the money to him.

				CARSON
		My ass.

				COLONEL LEE
		The hostages are citizens of the
		People's Republic of Korea --

				CARSON
		-- Hey, do I go to the torture
		chambers in your prisons, tell you
		how to do your job?

				WALTHER
		All right, you're outta here! Is
		this the same insubordinate crap you
		pulled at Beverly Thrift?

Carson glares coldly at Walther.

				CARSON
		I'll coordinate the drop.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		Perhaps that is better. Inspector
		Carson knows the terrain --

				COLONEL LEE
		-- Then he can come with me.

Walther looks at Miranda. She nods her assent.

				WALTHER
			(firm; to Carson)
		It's settled.

				CARSON
		It sucks.

				MIRANDA
		But it means we can get on with it.

The Americans leave the room.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY

Still fuming, Carson walks ahead. Miranda pulls Walther aside.

				MIRANDA
			(sotto)
		Get one thing straight, Mr. Walther.
		If the Bureau had listened to Pete,
		Beverly Thrift never would've
		happened.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

Hands shaking with nerve- and speed-induced jitters, Javal
turns two switches on the unit atop the TV. Two LED readouts
light up: one shows the current time -- 2:30 PM -- the other
is fixed at 5:00 PM. Below, the TV is still on.

Javal flips the channels, stopping at a rerun of "Lifestyles
of the Rich and Famous." He suppresses a gleeful giggle.

				JAVAL
		That's more like it...

He checks the contents of his prescription bottle. Two pills.
He takes one, stuffs the bottle in his pocket, and leaves.

EXT.  PíY³NGYANG, NORTH KOREA - DAY

SUPER: PíyÚngyang. Capitol of North Korea.

Poster city for the charms of Communism: dreary, crumbling,
gray, stifling, hopeless.

INT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - CONFERENCE CHAMBER - DAY

In the main government offices, a meeting of ten overly-
decorated MILITARY MEN and their SUPPORT STAFFS.

Sour GENERAL KAI (50's) is ARGUING heatedly in KOREAN with an
aged MODERATE GENERAL. The weak-willed PREMIER OF NORTH KOREA
sits up front and listens passively.

An ARMY MAJOR sitting behind General Kai stands and slips out
the door.

EXT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - ROOFTOP - DAY

Crouched behind an air-conditioning unit, the Major, an
American Operative, speaks in UNACCENTED ENGLISH into a small
UPLINK DEVICE, disguised to look like a palmtop computer.

				OPERATIVE
			(into uplink device)
		...They've got the Premier agreeing
		to the hard-line position --

He hears footsteps approaching (OS).

				OPERATIVE
			(continuing; sotto)
		More to follow...

He angles skyward a tiny dish-shaped antenna on the Device. On
its screen it says COMPRESSING... SCRAMBLING... UPLINKING...

After it's finished, the Operative snaps it closed and puts it
into a false bottom in his attachÈ case. He disappears just
before a GUARD rounds the corner.

EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

"Welcome Pacific Partners" banners hang everywhere.

WORKERS and CATERERS prepare for the various parties and
events around town. COPS and PRIVATE SECURITY do their best to
keep traffic moving, but it's already getting congested.

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Dave stares at his computer, looking through a DATABASE of
kidnappers and their modus operandi. He rubs his eyes.

				DAVE
		I wanted to be home by now, take the
		kids to the rally in Boyle Heights.

				SABATINI
		We got a cabin in Big Bear. By now,
		L.A. was supposed to be a brown
		blotch in the rear-view mirror.

She's helping Walther stack packs of THOUSAND-DOLLAR-BILLS
into a series of small plastic bags, tying each one off when
it's the size of a brick. They then put the individual bags
into two larger bags.

Robbins rubber-bands a matchbook-sized HOMING TRANSMITTER in
between two packs of cash. He then hollows out a dime-sized
space inside a different pack of money with a razor knife.

He puts a tiny, SECOND homing transmitter in the space. Carson
checks some hand-held receivers. Miranda crosses to him.

				MIRANDA
		He'll expect a homing device --

				CARSON
		-- I expect him to expect it. He'll
		check the cash with an RF detector...
			(re larger transmitter)
		Meaning he'll find this one.
			(re smaller transmitter)
		This only has a quarter-mile range,
		but on a frequency too low to detect.
			(turns off receiver)
		And I doubt the asshole will have an
		X-ray machine or a metal detector.

				MIRANDA
		Why must you always refer generically
		to criminals as "assholes?"

				CARSON
		Gosh, you're right. It could
		undermine their self-esteem and spoil
		their chances for rehabilitation.

	
				MIRANDA
		You been reading my magazines in the
		bathroom again?

She returns to listening to an AUDIO TAPE:

				JAVAL (VO)
			(thru recorder)
		"And my device will fulfill its
		function at exactly 5:00 PM..."

				MIRANDA
		He's really exhibiting pressured
		speech... big effort here to sound
		calm. Same with his vocabulary... if
		he were in control, he wouldn't feel
		such a need to sound that way.

				CARSON
		Just tell me if we can use it.

				MIRANDA
		If we needle him he could get sloppy
		and give us an opening, but I'm not
		going to risk it. This is the worst
		kind of perpetrator: anything makes
		him deviate from his carefully-
		scripted plan, he could become
		extremely volatile.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

During this, Colonel Lee stands in a window on the top floor,
pointing a LASER EAVESDROPPING UNIT at the FBI guardhouse.

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru headphones)
		Do we have back-up if the bleeper
		fails?

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru headphones)
		Nothing but physical surveillance.

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

				MIRANDA
		It's real important we don't lose
		him. He didn't go through all the
		trouble of designing that bomb not
		to use it.

Carson looks at her as the thought of it hits him.



				CARSON
		Well, it ain't gonna happen.
			(beat; sotto)
		Not again...

EXT.  WHITE HOUSE, WASHINGTON, DC - ESTABLISHING - DAY

INT.  WHITE HOUSE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

The National Security Council: VICE PRESIDENT, SECRETARIES OF
DEFENSE, STATE, CHIEFS of the FBI, CIA and NSA -- sit
nervously around a table, facing a video conferencing setup.
The President, in Air Force One, APPEARS on it.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		What the hell is the big crisis?

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		We just received a missive from the
		North Korean attachÈ. They say the
		kidnapping is a U.S. plot to provoke
		and humiliate them during the Summit.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		Bullshit. They're just ticked because
		we don't want the Chinese dragging
		their asses into the treaty talks.

The SENIOR INTELLIGENCE OFFICER refers to his notes.

				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
		We have a covert operative in place.
		He reports the hard-liners and
		moderates in the High Command are
		arguing about how to respond, should
		the Premier's niece and her children
		should be killed.

				PRESIDENT
			(scowls; thru video link)
		Respond?! Christ. What about the
		damn Premier?

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		He's weak. He has to look tough to
		save face, keep control of hard-
		liners... otherwise he risks a coup.

				CIA CHIEF
		Which is a real possibility. Most of
		those old-fart Generals don't want to
				-more-

				CIA CHIEF (Cont'd)
		be part of the Summit any more than
		we want them to. They're mad as hell
		he even talked to the Chinese.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		I don't want to deal with this right
		now! Get our diplomats on it. Tell
		the North we'll pay the ransom for
		'em... Placate 'em! And make damn
		sure we get that family back in one
		piece. Who's in charge in L.A.?

				FBI CHIEF
		The Bureau, Sir. We have a crack
		team in place.

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		There's a Diplomatic Liaison from
		State, too.

				CIA CHIEF
			(to FBI Chief)
		What about your man stationed at the
		Consulate...
			(refers to notes)
		Carson? He was demoted from the FBI
		Hostage Program, couple years back.
		And this did happen on his watch...

				FBI CHIEF
			(irritated)
		There's no way he could've prevented
		this abduction! Besides, I've got one
		of my top Negotiators in charge --

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		-- Whatever. I want a total news
		blackout and I want this over with,
		quickly! Without giving those Commie
		little bastards any excuse to shit
		all over my Summit!

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Inside, the grandfather clock in the foyer CHIMES THREE TIMES.

Colonel Lee, carrying an AMD-74 machine gun, goes to get in the
driver's side of the second armored Mercedes, but Carson is
already there. Grumbling, he crosses to the passenger's side.

Carson drives off just a moment before Colonel Lee is
completely in the car.



EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY

The Mercedes crosses Melrose, going into Hollywood. The town
is all done up with posters and banners.

Robbins and Walther follow a block behind the Mercedes in an
unmarked car; Sabatini and Dave drive ahead in Dave's Dodge.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Miranda, Ambassador Han, and Lisa's father (the cussing Jag
Owner) wait by the phone. Miranda smiles reassuringly at the
two nervous fathers. The phone RINGS; she picks it up.

				MIRANDA
			(into phone)
		Yes, please go ahead...

				JAVAL (VO)
			(long beat; thru phone)
		Ah... this must be one of those
		professionals --

				MIRANDA
			(into phone)
		-- I'm only here to see that
		everyone gets what they want --

				JAVAL (VO)
			(thru phone)
		-- I've got my shotgun in little
		Lisa's mouth, and I will pull the
		trigger in five seconds unless you
		put the Ambassador on the phone.

Miranda hands the phone to Ambassador Han.

INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

From the two-way radio in Carson's pocket:

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru radio)
		The drop is at the DeMille barn,
		across from the Hollywood Bowl.
		You're to leave the money in the
		center of the parking lot.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Shit... no way we can set up a stake-
		out in...
				-more-

				CARSON (Cont'd)
			(checks watch)
		Four minutes. Call the Park Rangers
		at the Bowl. Have them clear the
		area of civilians.

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Remember, Pete... we're dealing with
		a customer with a lot of rage.

				CARSON
			(to himself)
		Must've bought a house same time we
		did.

EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

Robbins and Walther are inching along in traffic on Highland
near Hollywood Blvd.

Elsewhere, we see unmarked police and government cars cruising
around, dropping off disguised FOOT-SURVEILLANCE OFFICERS, etc.

A BIKER CLUB

of twenty aging, weekend-warriors, all on custom Harleys, turn
from the Boulevard onto Highland.

EXT.  DEMILLE BARN - DAY

Carson drives the Mercedes into the entrance of the Hollywood
Museum Park. Carson stops in front of a yellow barn with a
sign atop it: "Jesse Lasky Famous Players."

INT./EXT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

Still disguised as an ice-cream truck, the van is parked
across Highland by the entrance to the Hollywood Bowl, where a
Summit-related concert is being readied.

Javal watches the Mercedes, and takes his last pill. He's flying.

INT.  MERCEDES - DAY

Colonel Lee grabs the two large plastic bags full of money
from the back seat, opens his door, and drops them onto the
pavement. Carson looks around.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		There's about a hundred ways he can
		scurry off like a cockroach from
		here... So spread out.

Colonel Lee checks their BEEPING homing receiver. Carson hangs
a left onto Highland, going back the way he came.

INT.  DAVE'S DODGE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Dave holds their homing receiver. Sabatini, behind the wheel,
smacks his arm and points ahead:

EXT.  DEMILLE BARN - DAY

Javal's van drives into the parking lot, and stops right above
the bags of money.

				DAVE
			(into radio)
		Our boy's in a fuckin' ice cream
		truck!

EXT.  ODIN STREET - DAY

Sabatini and Dave watch Javal's van through the trees.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

Javal, sweating and shaking, quickly runs a metal-detector
wand over each of the individual bags of money. One of them
makes the speaker in the wand handle WHINE.

INT.  DAVE'S DODGE - INCLUDE POV OF DEMILLE BARN - DAY

The van pulls away.

Dave glances at the homing receiver. The signal isn't moving.
He looks up...

Two of the small bags of money are sitting on the pavement.

				DAVE
		Son of a bitch!
			(into radio)
		He found the bleepers -- both of
		them!

INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Fuck! Okay, stay back. It's not like
		he'll be hard to see in that truck.
		Which way's he heading?

				DAVE (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Toward the freeway.

Carson hangs a U-turn.



EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY

At the complex intersection where Highland ends at the 101,
Javal bears to the right, toward the South on-ramp.

Sabatini and Dave follow a few cars behind as he gets on it.

Suddenly, he scoots over to the shoulder and slams the van
into REVERSE. He backs off the on-ramp, past a row of angry
drivers, passing by Sabatini and Dave.

Peeling in reverse onto Highland, Javal stomps on the brakes.
The snap buckles holding the ice-cream-truck superstructure
around his van BREAK APART, and the whole thing slides off...
blocking Sabatini's way.

Javal drives forward again, this time getting onto the 101
North on-ramp.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Miranda looks at Ambassador Han and Lisa's father while
anxiously clutching her two-way radio.

				MIRANDA
			(into radio)
		What happened?

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru radio)
		We're made! Gotta grab him!

				MIRANDA
			(beat; into radio)
		All right... Carefully...

INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson follows Javal onto the freeway. Colonel Lee grabs his
AMD-74 machine gun.

				CARSON
		Watch it! We need him alive!

EXT.  HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - DAY

Colonel Lee leans out and SHOOTS Javal's rear tires out.

The van drives erratically, held in its lane by bumping
against the cars around it.

Carson pulls up closer...

Suddenly, the rear doors of the van burst open...

And Javal flies out, riding a motorcycle. He's got the money
stuffed into two big, chaps-sized SADDLEBAGS slung over the
back of the machine.

He straddles the lanes, going against traffic, riding like a
maniac back the way he came.

Carson watches him in the rear-view... and speeds up, driving
away from him.

				COLONEL LEE
		Turn around!

But Carson hugs the shoulder, moving through the heavy
traffic, until he spots what he was looking for:

The Biker Club, riding in formation up ahead.

Carson cuts in front of them and slams on the brakes. He jumps
out and grabs one of the Biker's machines by the handlebars,
wrestling it to a stop. While pulling its BURLY OWNER off it:

				CARSON
		FBI. Call our office, they'll take
		care of you.

Meanwhile, the other BIKERS have come to help their friend.
They pull guns, knives, chains...

They're stopped by Sabatini, who appears holding her MP-5
machine pistol. The Biker yells at Carson as he drives way:

				BIKER
		I'm a taxpayer! I'm a goddamn
		dentist!

COLONEL LEE

gets in the driver's seat of the Mercedes and turns it around.

JAVAL

continues down the freeway on his bike, straddling lanes,
driving the wrong way, retracing his route back to Highland,
leaving CAR HORNS, CURSING, and COLLISIONS in his wake.

WIDER

When everyone thinks they've seen it all, here comes another
mad biker -- Carson -- riding against traffic in pursuit.



EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY

Javal rides against traffic down the Cahuenga on-ramp, then
jumps the divider, runs the light crossing Highland, and gets
into the southbound lanes.

He just misses a BUS, nearly wiping out.

				CARSON
		Just don't kill yourself, you piece
		of shit...

Carson fishes out his two-way.

				CARSON
			(continuing; into radio)
		Helicopter or two would be nice!

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Listening to the two-way, Miranda tries to follow the action.

				MIRANDA
			(into radio)
		Love to be in the loop on this...

EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY

Speeding up, Carson precariously cuts in between traffic.

				CARSON
			(to himself)
		Not just now, dear...

Seeing Carson approaching on his right, Javal pulls his Benelli
shotgun from one of the saddlebags. He rests the barrel on his
arm and FIRES a blinding-white load of magnesium at Carson.

Carson grabs the brake handles to slow down, and the BLAST
crosses just in front of him. A few BURNING pieces pepper the
front fender of the bike, but the bulk HITS the concrete art-
deco statue in the entrance to the Hollywood Bowl. The statue
shatters into a million FLAMING fragments.

				CARSON
			(continuing; grumbling)
		I coulda had a ranch... maybe some
		horses... but no, we moved to L.A.

JAVAL

speeds up. A car passing on the right BUMPS him. Javal grabs
for the handlebar to stabilize himself, DROPPING the shotgun.

A HELICOPTER appears, and flies just above him.

Then, spotting some police cars ahead, he quickly hangs a
right, ducking onto Alta Loma Terrace.

EXT.  ALTA LOMA TERRACE - DAY

Carson stops at the entrance to the winding, hillside
neighborhood, accessible only by footpaths. The area is
covered by thick foliage, hiding Javal from the helicopter.

Carson revs down so he can listen for Javal's machine. He
HEARS it up above and takes off, up a steep flight of stairs.

NEW ANGLE

Javal has reached the summit, only to find he's boxed in. He
can either turn around, or take the neighborhood's unique,
outdoor elevator, housed in a free-standing, three-story
concrete tower.

He jumps off his bike. Carrying the saddlebags, he runs into
the elevator -- but it needs a key to operate.

Javal comes back out, panicking.  He HEARS Carson coming up
the hill. He spots a GARDENER watering nearby with a hose.

ANGLE WITH CARSON

as he reaches the summit. He sees Javal's motorcycle,
abandoned, lying on its side...

And then he sees the Gardener, sprawled on the ground, a
BULLET HOLE in the center of his forehead.

Carson turns off his motorcycle and pulls out his Sig 9mm. He
moves slowly toward the elevator tower and looks inside.

HIS POV

The casement window in the back of the tower is broken. One end
of the gardener's hose is tied to a grate, and the hose is
hanging through the broken window.

Carson looks out the window as Javal climbs down the outside of
the tower on the hose to High Tower Drive, the street below.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		He's on foot, at the base of the
		elevator tower!

But just as Carson is about to climb down the hose...



EXT.  HIGH TOWER DRIVE - DAY

Javal spots a COLLEGE GIRL backing a tiny Geo out of her
garage. He rips her out of the car, jumps in and tears away.

EXT.  ALTA LOMA TERRACE - DAY

Carson jumps back on his motorcycle and starts it up.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Goddammit! He's in a blue Geo!

EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY

In the Geo, Javal drives out onto Highland. He muscles his way
through traffic, then cuts across to Franklin.

Behind him, Robbins and Walther drive along the divider lane.

On the bike, Carson emerges from Alta Loma, joining Sabatini
and Dave in Dave's Dodge and Colonel Lee in the Mercedes as
they all try to catch up to Javal.

The helicopter flies ahead, then disappears past the hill
below Franklin.

EXT.  VINE STREET - DAY

Javal hangs a hard right off of Franklin onto Vine, putting
him on top of a hill that drops down to Sunset.

Carson and Colonel Lee close in on the Geo.

Suddenly, the helicopter RISES UP from the bottom of the hill.
It's less than fifty feet in front of Javal, at eye level.

Javal FIRES at the copter with his Beretta.

Colonel Lee indiscriminately FIRES his machine gun at the Geo.

Carson SHOUTS at Colonel Lee, furious at his carelessness!

INT.  PURSUIT COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Colonel Lee's BULLETS trace across the cockpit of the
helicopter; one hits the PILOT in the neck. Clutching it with
one hand, the Pilot loses control of the copter.

EXT.  VINE STREET - DAY

Everyone on the road scatters to get out of the copter's way.
It appears as though it's going to crash onto the street, then
it gains altitude, GYRATING wildly just above the Geo.

Javal tries to move away, but one of its landing runners
SMASHES through the top of the windshield, WEDGING itself
against the inside of the Geo's roof.

Snared, the little Geo is LIFTED off the ground -- instantly
too high for a terrified Javal to escape from it.

INT.  PURSUIT COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

The wounded Pilot, barely conscious, searches for safe area to
set down -- but there are cars and people everywhere.

The Pilot wrestles his stick; his copter is almost impossible
to control with the car hanging from it. He's fading...

EXT.  VINE STREET - DAY

The copter and Geo lurch over and past the round Capitol
Records building, KNOCKING the spindle off the top of it.

The impact further destabilizes the copter's flight. It's
heading right toward the 20-story Sunset Vine Tower, at the
bottom of the hill.

INT.  JAVAL'S GEO - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Javal, trapped inside, looks through the windshield as the
glass and steel side of the tower looms closer. He SCREAMS.

EXT.  SUNSET VINE TOWER - DAY

The copter and the Geo CRASH into the side of the Tower, 12
floors up. Glass blows out in all directions; the rotor
shatters; office furnishings are blown through the hole like
backwash.

The Geo hangs passenger's side down from the runner.

CLOSER

From the series of jerking, slipping MOVEMENTS, it is clear
the copter is not going to stay where it is for long.

The Geo's passenger side door pops open. Javal, panting with
fear, jimmies his foot against the dashboard and holds the
steering wheel to keep from falling out.

ANGLE ON VEHICLES BELOW

In the clog of traffic, cars swerve away, rapidly reverse...
anything to get away from the area below the impact.



JAVAL

reacts to another SLIP. The big saddlebags of money on the
seat start to slide toward the open door.

He gingerly reaches over to grab them... the copter SHIFTS
again... he loses his grip...

And, clutching the saddlebags, he TOPPLES out of the car.

We stay with him as he FALLS 12 stories, SCREAMING...

Then LANDING on top of a parking meter. It RIPS though his
chest and he hits the sidewalk with a wet THUD.

EXT.  VINE AND SUNSET - DAY

Carson rushes across the street to Javal's body. The teetering
copter and Geo are right above it.

Grimacing, Carson tries to lift Javal's body up off the
parking meter, but it's messy, slippery work...

Unable to move the body, Carson quickly searches its pockets.
All he finds is the now-empty prescription bottle.

Above, the copter GROANS... it's about to come loose...

Carson pulls out his Sig 9mm and FIRES several times at
Javal's right wrist, then TEARS the HAND off the body.

With a loud WRENCHING of metal, the copter and Geo break away
from the building.

Carson grabs the saddlebags and runs like hell across the
street, diving for cover behind a car.

BEHIND CARSON

the copter and Geo crash to the sidewalk and EXPLODE.

NEW ANGLE

Sooty, covered in Javal's blood, Carson crosses to the others.
He throws Walther the saddlebags and Sabatini the severed hand.

				CARSON
		Fingerprint it.
			(to Walther)
		He's not gonna tell us where to find
		the hostages...
				-more-

				CARSON (Cont'd)
			(looks at watch)
		Meaning we got exactly 80 minutes to
		figure it out for ourselves.

				WALTHER
		Figure it out?! With what?!

				CARSON
			(ignores him; into radio)
		Miranda! We need a copter, pronto!
			(to Robbins)
		Get back to his van. There were no
		plates, but check the VIN, look it
		over, then meet us at the Consulate.

Robbins is still trying to process what just happened.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		Go!

							CUT TO:

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

The clock reads 3:50 PM. Carson, Miranda, Robbins, Sabatini,
Ambassador Han and Colonel Lee are all TALKING at once.

				CARSON
			(to Walther)
		...Scrounge us some bodies: National
		Guard, State Troopers, CHPs, local
		PD's, meter maids --

				WALTHER
		-- They're gonna search the whole
		city in a goddamn hour..?!

				CARSON
		Look, I don't need you to tell me
		how fucked we are!

				WALTHER
		Fuck you!! Every time you're on a
		case something explodes!

Carson looks like he's going to explode. Before he can reply:

				MIRANDA
		Stop! The clock's running! Arguing
		is a luxury we can't afford!
				-more-

				MIRANDA (Cont'd)
			(looks at Carson)
		What's done is done. There'll be
		plenty of time to point fingers
		later.

Carson would love to get into it, but he lets it slide. He
looks Sabatini, wandering aimlessly with Javal's severed hand.

				SABATINI
		I need some fuckin' ink!!

Carson grabs one of the expensive pens from Ambassador Han's
desk, SNAPS it in half, and hands it to her.

In the b.g. she stands at the credenza, inks the hand's fingers
and thumb and rolls them onto a piece of letterhead paper.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		This is impossible! How can you even
		begin to find them?

Good question. All eyes go to Miranda.

				MIRANDA
		Well, the normal procedure is to
		negotiate with the perpetrator...

Her head is spinning. She looks at Carson.

				CARSON
		Let's take stock. We've got a picture
		of where he hid the family, and
		recordings of his calls --

				MIRANDA
		-- That's right! We can send them to
		our experts for analysis...

				CARSON
			(to Ambassador Han)
		Same with his fingerprints. But that
		means we need high-quality image and
		data transmission. We can piss away
		ten minutes coptering this shit to
		our offices in Westwood, or we can
		use your surveillance equipment.

				COLONEL LEE
		There is no surveillance equipment.
		This is a diplomatic facility --

				CARSON
		-- You want to play games, fine.

He turns to go. Ambassador Han turns to Colonel Lee.



				AMBASSADOR HAN
		Take them upstairs.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

In the converted attic, several North Korean ESPIONAGE AGENTS
monitor military and police frequencies, downlinks from remote
wiretaps and surveillance units; short-wave, cellular, etc.
Their equipment, being of Chinese and Iranian manufacture, is
hardly cutting-edge technology.

Colonel Lee and Ambassador Han enter. The Espionage Agents are
surprised when Carson, Miranda, Walther and Sabatini follow.
Walther looks around, amazed. Carson grabs a pair of headphones.

				CARSON
		South Korean Consulate's just down
		the street -- want to take a listen?

Colonel Lee pulls the phones away from him.

Carson takes the page with the fingerprints from Sabatini. The
Espionage Agents back away from her and Javal's hand.

				CARSON
			(continuing; re hand)
		Shitcan that thing, will you?!

She looks around. Then, shrugging, she tosses it into a
wastepaper basket.

				CARSON
			(continuing; to Colonel Lee)
		Got a digital scanner?

				COLONEL LEE
		Analog.

				CARSON
			(looks equipment over)
		You might want to drop a few bucks at

		Dave -- get in here. Bring your
		computer, a city map, and the tapes
		of the ransom calls.

				DAVE (VO)
			(thru radio)
		On my way...

He's also HEARD, faintly, through the laser eavesdropping unit
by the window. Carson notices, but doesn't comment.



				MIRANDA
			(to Colonel Lee)
		Colonel, you saw the perp. Describe
		him to the Ambassador, see if it's
		anyone he knows.

Colonel Lee begrudgingly obliges. Carson dials a phone.

				CARSON
			(into phone)
		This is Carson in L.A. There's a set
		of prints coming over. Narrow the
		search criteria: Male, thirties,
		Caucasian... French, Belgian, Swiss,
		maybe Canadian. Try kidnappers and
		bombers first. We need an answer in
		fifteen minutes.

EXT.  HOOVER BUILDING, WASHINGTON, DC - DAY

FBI headquarters, with the Washington Monument in the b.g.

INT.  HOOVER BUILDING - FINGERPRINT LAB - DAY

A TECHNICIAN, wearing thick glasses, sits in front of a high-
resolution computer monitor.

				FINGERPRINT TECH

		That yellow air out there finally
		rot your brain?! It's impossible!

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru phone)
		Dazzle me.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Carson clicks off the phone, then, as he dials another number:

				CARSON
			(to Walther)
		We got one of the best sound guys
		right here in town...
			(into phone)
		Newman in Audio Analysis...

				DAVE (OS)
		Newman's gone.

WIDER

Dave comes into the room.



				DAVE
		He quit, couple weeks ago. Opened a
		bed and breakfast in Wyoming.

Carson looks at Miranda and hangs up the phone.

				DAVE
			(continuing; looks around)
		Damn... they get HBO? I'd sure like
		to see the fight tonight.

				CARSON
		Get those tapes transferred to a
		sound guy. We need ambient and
		background analysis, the whole
		enchilada.

				DAVE
		Enchilada -- you saying that because
		I'm Mexican?

				CARSON
		No... 'cause you're fat.

				MIRANDA
			(picks up Javal's fax)
		Photo enhancement... Isn't there
		some amazing tech with the LAPD --

				DAVE
		-- Bronsky. Transferred to Seattle
		PD a month ago.

				CARSON
		Jesus H. Christ...

				SABATINI
		I'd send it to Langley. Let the CIA
		earn their keep.

				CARSON
		Do it.

Carson tosses Javal's bloody, unlabeled prescription bottle to
Miranda. She looks it over, runs her finger inside, tastes the
dust on her fingertip.

				MIRANDA
		Given his behavior, this orange
		residue... I'd say Desoxyn, 25 mg.
		Amphetamines.

				CARSON
		Any significance?



				MIRANDA
		It's consistent with the lone wolf
		scenario: A handful of these is pure
		bravery-in-a-bottle, 'til the
		psychosis and paranoia kick in.
			(beat)
		We could check pharmacy records, on
		the remote chance he got them
		legally... if we had a couple of
		weeks, that is.

				CARSON
			(to Sabatini)
		Get the Bureau on it.

				MIRANDA
		Forget it. It's a waste of manpower.

				CARSON
		Look, goddammit, you start skipping
		no-chance-in-hell leads, we can all
		quit and go to the beach right now.

Sabatini looks at them -- which will it be? Miranda frowns and
nods her okay, then spreads the L.A. map out on the table.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		He grabbed the family at 8:30. The
		last certain visual we had was just
		before his van went into the alley
		on La Cienega at 8:42. He called the
		Consulate at 9:30.

				MIRANDA
		That gives him about fifty minutes
		to get to his location, move and
		secure the hostages, and activate
		his time bomb.

				CARSON
		He probably waited a while to pad
		the time -- he wanted us know the
		family was still alive...
			(sotto; re Koreans)
		...So these crazy bastards wouldn't
		throw a premature shit hemorrhage,
		but he didn't want to call too soon,
		either. I say they're within 15 to
		20 minutes, via surface streets, of
		where we last saw them.

He draws a circle on the city map: Beverly Hills to downtown,
Hollywood to Inglewood.



				MIRANDA
		The most densely-populated part of
		the L.A. basin. This narrows it down
		to about 200,000 dwellings.

A beat while this sinks in.

				MIRANDA
			(continuing)
		He was traveling west --

				CARSON
		-- Bet he doubled back.

				MIRANDA
		C'mon, that's total conjecture --

				SABATINI
			(re Carson)
		-- I'd trust his instincts when
		dealing with maniacs. He is deeply
		disturbed.

				MIRANDA
		You're telling me?

INT.  WHITE HOUSE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Everyone is smoking. Their tension has increased tenfold since
we last saw them. The President, SEEN through the video setup,
is pacing on Air Force One.

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		...North Koreans have gone ballistic,
		accusing us of botching the ransom
		drop on purpose.

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		They're still harping on that
		"American plot" nonsense.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		Meaning?

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		They say the death of the Premier's
		niece and her family would justify
		immediate retaliation.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		Are they out of their fuckin' minds?!
		What kind of retaliation?

Everyone in the room looks at one another.



				CIA CHIEF
		They're threatening to pull a Saddam
		Hussein: remember the Scuds he lobbed
		at Jerusalem during Desert Storm?
			(beat)
		They're talking about firing a
		missile into Los Angeles --

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		-- A goddamn WHAT??

				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
		Best guess is an AS-15, medium-range
		cruise -- their version of our
		Tomahawk, launched from offshore.

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		The AS-15 is gyro-guided. It will
		find the city, but it's not too
		accurate beyond that.

				VICE PRESIDENT
		Still, for their purposes it's
		perfect: Hit somewhere in L.A., take
		out a city block or two...

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		To the eyes of the world it's a
		measured response -- like what Reagan
		did to Qaddafi. But actually striking
		at an American city would be a huge
		psychological victory for them.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		I don't believe I'm hearing this!
			(beat)
		So if we know it's coming, we can
		knock it out of the fuckin' sky!

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		These weapons fly subsonically, below
		radar... we don't have the defenses
		in place... If we'd had the time to
		deploy a string of Patriot anti-
		missile batteries across the coast --

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		-- You're saying we got all this
		lousy hardware and can't stop one
		goddamn missile??

Everyone's silence answers his question.



				PRESIDENT
			(continuing; thru video
			link)
		I want an immediate search for all
		ships within range.

				FBI CHIEF
		We better inform the other leaders,
		stall on the Summit --

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		There's no reason to panic yet --
		they can't launch until after the
		family's confirmed dead!

				CIA CHIEF
		Afraid that's not the case...

The Intelligence Officer illustrates his explanation with
FOOTAGE and DIAGRAMS on a nearby COMPUTER SCREEN:

				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
		The North Korean Premier holds what
		we call a "Brinksman Switch." He's
		able to destroy a missile in flight,
		right up to the moment before it
		achieves its target.

				CIA CHIEF
		Our Op says they've timed their
		retaliation to hit right after 5:00.

				FBI CHIEF
		And if the family turns up okay,
		they'll just make it self-destruct.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		Shit! I really don't need this today!

				VICE PRESIDENT
		We're forgetting one thing here: the
		family. Intelligence is sure the
		North will abort their attack if Mrs.
		Han and her kids are safely returned?

				CIA CHIEF
		Absolutely. Their whole game depends
		on claiming a legitimate provocation.

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		Still, we should let them know there'd
		be a response... if it comes to it.



				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		I'd like to turn 'em into a
		radioactive parking lot.

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		That's the problem: we can't. We're
		the last superpower. Our hands are
		tied by politics, alliances, goddamn
		stacks of treaties... most we could
		do is give 'em a "measured response"
		back again, or everyone starts
		crying that we're the bullies.

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		Damn, I miss the Cold War. Russians
		wouldn't have dreamt of pulling a
		stunt like this.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		Believe me, the North drops one in
		my fuckin' city, I'm dropping ten in
		theirs. Get some bombers in the air.
		And don't tell me any more bad news!

EXT.  HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - DAY

Robbins stands by Javal's van, on the shoulder of the freeway.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Cute.
			(to Miranda)
		He signed the name of the Allied
		Commander during the Korean War.
		Maybe he was a political.

				MIRANDA
		No. The phony ice cream truck, the
		booby-trapped chairs... he could've
				-more-

				MIRANDA (Cont'd)
		done it without half that stuff. But
		this was going to be the score of a
		lifetime... he was showing off.

				CARSON
			(to Dave)
		Who's got those kinds of skills:
		Electronics, vehicle customizing,
		computers, explosives?

				DAVE
		Military. Cop, maybe. Shit, your
		average high-school student if
		they're so inclined. My guess is our
		perp used off-the-shelf equipment
		for everything except the C-4, and
		that's only slightly harder to get
		than crack or heroin, if you know
		who to ask.

Everyone who can be spared, even moth-eaten SUPPORT PERSONNEL,
hustle through the maze of hallways and get into waiting cars.

From up here, it looks like the city is one big block party.
Accordingly, traffic is heavy and unpleasant.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Bobbi looks into the TV camera, dripping with sincerity.

				BOBBI
		This is Bobbi Marchfelder, your Eye

The red light on the camera goes off. Bobbi turns to the Pilot.



				BOBBI
			(continuing; furious)
		Hey, dickhead... I was backlit that
		entire segment!
			(as if to a child)
		Keep... the sun... to my left!!

The Cameraman and the Pilot sigh at each other.

				BOBBI
			(continuing)
		What's new on the kidnapping rumor?

				CAMERAMAN
		Nada. Total news blackout.

				BOBBI
		Go back over the hill.

				NEWS PILOT
		We got the valley traffic report in
		fifteen --

				BOBBI
		-- "Stalled vehicle! One lane closed!
		Sig alert..!" I'll improvise!

She takes an industrial-sized bottle of Mylanta out of her
purse. It's fitted with a water-bottle DRINKING SPOUT. She
takes a huge swig and grimaces.

				BOBBI
			(continuing; to Cameraman)
		What are you lookin' at? I was the
		morning anchor in Houston! And I'm

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - LOS ANGELES - DAY

The Han family sits in their booby-trapped chairs. Joy
carefully turns to her mother.

		What if something goes wrong?

				MRS. HAN
			(firmly)
		It won't.



INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Carson grabs his FBI blazer off the back of a chair.

				CARSON
		I'm going to the kidnapping site.

				MIRANDA
		I want to talk to the witnesses.

Colonel Lee also heads for the door. Carson looks at him.

				CARSON
		Great, we'll hire a bus.

They leave. Dave, meanwhile, paces, phone in hand.

				DAVE

				SABATINI
		Big surprise. Have 'em send a list of

				DAVE
		That's what I'm trying to get.
		They're saying I need a subpoena.

EXT.  PACIFIC OCEAN - ANGLE ON FISHING TRAWLER - DAY

SUPER: Pacific Ocean. 500 miles west-northwest of Los Angeles.

We FIND a nondescript commercial fishing vessel. Up top, some
Asian "FISHERMEN" crank in and stow their nets.



INT./EXT.  FISHING TRAWLER - DAY

Coming closer, we see it's actually a disguised North Korean
SPY VESSEL. Several MEN, working under hanging tarps, secure
a 20-foot-long missile launching track to the bow.

Two MISSILE EXPERTS install a green, cone-shaped WARHEAD of
high explosives onto the nose of a 23-foot-long, short-winged
CRUISE MISSILE. They wait for the CAPTAIN's orders...

EXT.  HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - DAY

Robbins is in Javal's van, examining the innards of the remote-
control boxes. He picks up his radio.

				ROBBINS
			(into radio)
		A lot of the components are made by
		the same manufacturer -- a car
		security company.

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Jump a copter to the Consulate. See
		if the manufacturer sells to the
		public. Find out what shops use their
		stuff; put people on the phones with
		a description of the perp.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

At the kidnapping site, the intersection is blocked off with
yellow police tape. Several LAPD cruisers are parked nearby.
Some COPS are interviewing the Carpool Lady.

Despite this, the neighborhood's bazaar -- a sidewalk sale
with MUSIC, food vendors, etc. -- has half-heartedly begun.

The government helicopter HOVERS and Carson helps Miranda climb
down a long chain ladder. Colonel Lee follows impatiently.

NEW ANGLE

Carson uncovers the bodies of the Driver and the Motorist,
lying on the sidewalk. He grimaces. Colonel Lee does not.
Miranda wants to look, but Carson drops the cover. She picks
it up, then turns away in horror.

A young BLACK COP crosses to them. He's holding a plastic bag
with a spent shotgun shell in it.

				YOUNG COP
		Inspector! Look at this...
			(reads from shell)
		"Dragon's Breath..?"



				CARSON
		Twelve-gauge shell filled with
		magnesium and ignition powder. Shit's
		worse than napalm -- Geneva
		Convention outlawed it for warfare.

				MIRANDA
		Then how did he get it?

				CARSON
		Easy -- you can buy 'em mail order.
			(looks around)
		Where's the Consulate's car?

				YOUNG COP
			(beat)
		Uh... apparently it was stolen...

				COLONEL LEE
		Stolen!? What is it with you
		people --

				YOUNG COP
			(angry)
		-- What's this "you people" shit?

				CARSON
			(to Colonel Lee)
		Shut up!

				MIRANDA
			(aside; to Young Cop)
		He means all of us "you people."

				CARSON
			(to Young Cop)
		Find it! How many bulletproof
		Mercedes could be cruising around
		Crenshaw?

				YOUNG COP
		You'd be surprised...

				CARSON
		I hate this fuckin' town.

INT./EXT.  FISHING TRAWLER - PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY

The North Korean COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER puts down his
headphones and hurries on deck to the Captain. It's time.

Suddenly, a BEARDED CREWMAN crosses to the Captain. He calmly
SHOOTS him and the FIRST MATE.

The rest of the Crew is shocked. Holding his pistol on the
Crew, the Bearded Crewman nods at the Missile Experts.
Saluting, they remove the green warhead from the missile.

Two OTHER CONSPIRATORS, carrying a metal locker, appear from
below deck. The Crew murmurs nervously as they remove from the
locker a red warhead and attach it to the missile.

Finishing, one of the Experts pushes the firing trigger and
the missile WHOOSHES from its launching pad.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

The government helicopter touches down behind the Consulate.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Ambassador Han, Walther and Sabatini are looking at a series
of high-definition faxes spread out on a table.

Carson, Miranda and Colonel Lee hurry back in. Disgusted,
Carson throws his jacket on a chair.

				CARSON
		Wasted trip: Witnesses say he was
		working alone, and he was a vicious
		son of a bitch. Old news.

				COLONEL LEE
			(to Ambassador Han)
		And our car was stolen.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		I felt safer when I was the
		Ambassador to Libya.

				SABATINI
		Image enhancements came back.

POV OF PICTURES

The CIA technicians have enlarged and enhanced every part of
the fax deemed significant, in individual blowups.

BACK TO SCENE

Colonel Lee is standing right beside Carson, leaning over to
look at the pictures. Carson looks at him, irritated.

				CARSON
		We going steady?



				SABATINI
		The sun position tells us the
		windows are facing northeast.
			(beat)
		Here's the best -- look at the glass
		on the prints hanging in the
		background. There's a reflection of
		a reflection, out on the street: the
		corner of a billboard.

				CARSON
		Looks like the wheel of a car.

				MIRANDA
		We talked about these billboards,
		when we were car shopping! Four-
		door... they make a wagon, too.
			(beat)
		Something Japanese... God, what was
		it? Toyota... Mazda... Honda... You
		thought it had no character.

				CARSON
		I thought that about all of them.
		C'mon, think, dammit!!

				MIRANDA
		You think!! You were there, too!

They're stumped, and bitterly frustrated. To Sabatini:

				CARSON
		Call the outdoor advertising
		companies. Get the location of all
		the billboards for Japanese cars
		within our search parameters.

Meanwhile, Dave and Robbins are calling car alarm shops:

				DAVE
			(into phone)
		...Peerless Auto Security. We need
		to know whether you've sold a large
		quantity of these components to any

EXT.  PíY³NGYANG, NORTH KOREA - ESTABLISHING - DAY

INT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - GENERAL KAI'S OFFICE - DAY

General Kai stands in hushed conversation with the Army Major
Operative and another trusted AIDE. The PHONE buzzes; the
others leave the room before General Kai picks it up.



INT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - OPERATIVE'S OFFICE - DAY

Behind closed doors, the Operative LISTENS to the phone call
with an EAVESDROPPING RECEIVER. What he hears stuns him.

							CUT TO:

EXT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - ROOFTOP - DAY

The Operative is in his hiding spot with his uplink device.

				OPERATIVE
			(urgently; into device)
		...Missile heading to L.A. has a
		Kipchak Warhead! Repeat: missile is
		Kipchak equipped! It was switched by
		order of --

A GUNSHOT rings out (OS), and the Operative's chest EXPLODES
in blood. He pitches forward... but presses the "transmit"
button on the uplink device before dying.

On screen it says UPLINKING... (without scrambling)... then
another GUNSHOT destroys it.

Angry, General Kai steps INTO FRAME and kicks the Operative
over with his foot.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - LOS ANGELES - DAY

Mrs. Han and Joy sit motionless. Sam, on the other hand, is
trying not to squirm. Mrs. Han looks at him, angry.

				MRS. HAN
		He asked you if you had to go...

The family becomes aware of a shrill SOUND, (OS), distant at
first, but growing increasingly louder... The sound-level
meters all begin to creep upward...

EXT.  APARTMENT BUILDING - CLOSE - DAY

A team of GARDENERS has arrived on the property for their
weekly mow, blow, and go. They have lawnmowers, edgers, blowers
-- it's as NOISY as an aircraft carrier during takeoffs.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

The SOUND is getting louder, and louder...

				JOY
		Oh, my God...

The meters are hovering just below the red...



SAM

pivots his head and looks at the tiny microphone, no bigger
than a pencil eraser, attached neatly to the headrest.

He begins chewing his wad of GUM... leans in toward the
microphone, his head obscuring what he's doing...

He moves back and we see he's SEALED the front of the mic with
a small piece of the gum.

And his meter drops to zero.

WIDER

Sam tilts his head forward and bends his wrist upward so he
can get the rest of the gum out of his mouth. Then, while
keeping pressure on the armrest with his elbow, he moves his
hand over to Mrs. Han. They can't quite reach each other...

He FLICKS the piece of gum and she catches it.

Meanwhile, the NOISE increases. The two meters peak into the
red... the yellow WARNING LIGHT begins to flash...

Mrs. Han quickly puts the gum in her mouth, bites it in half,
and cautiously passes the remainder over to Joy.

Joy puts the gum in her mouth. She tries to push it over her
mic, but her hair is in the way. She shakes her head; some
hair strands remain, but she covers the mic just as the
Gardeners' noise reaches a CRESCENDO...

All three sound meters sit pinned to zero. The yellow light
stops flashing.

Sam, sweating, looks at his mother and sister... and starts
laughing. They join him: a celebration for a small victory.

INT.  WHITE HOUSE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DUSK

The clock on the wall reads 7:13, eastern time. The President,
still on Air Force One, APPEARS on the VIDEO LINK. Cut the
tension in the room with a knife? You'd need a chainsaw.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		So what the hell does "Kipchak" mean?

				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
		Uh, it's a code name... for weapons
		using the Yersinia Pestis bacillus...

He really doesn't want to be the one telling the President
about this.



				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
			(continuing)
		Kipchaks were Asian nomads. In 1347
		they attacked a Genoese fort, and
		catapulted infected corpses over the
		walls. The Genoese who survived
		carried the disease back to Europe...
		and it killed half the population.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		Get to the goddamn point, Major.

The Intelligence Officer looks at the CIA Chief.

				CIA CHIEF
		Seems the missile is armed with a
		warhead carrying the Pneumonic
		Plague.

The President goes nuts.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		The Black Plague?! Every time I talk
		to you fuckin' guys it gets worse!
		What happened to this "limited
		retaliation" shit?

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		The North Koreans insist the missile
		carries a conventional payload. They
		say we're trying to trick them into
		aborting the attack.

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		Especially since the uplink from our
		Op in P'yÚngyang was unencrypted.

				CIA CHIEF
		We think one of the Hard-liners
		switched the warhead without the
		Premier's knowledge. But he's not
		about to take our word for it, and
		he's too weak to risk the
		humiliation of backing down.

				PRESIDENT
			(incredulous; thru video
			link)
		They use a biological weapon on
		American soil, they have to know
		we'll respond!



				SECRETARY OF STATE
		Maybe they don't think we got the
		guts. Maybe they want a war, 'cause
		they think they can whip us, like
		what happened in 'Nam. Look who
		we're dealing with: a teetering,
		outlaw regime, and inside it, some
		wild-ass renegades working their
		screwy agenda!

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		What the hell are we doing in L.A.?

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		We've deployed Marines from Pendleton
		and Twenty-Nine Palms, Army from Ft.
		Irwin, put 'em in protective suits,
		but it's 40 minutes before they're on
		the ground.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		All right. Assuming the worst...
		What'll happen?

The Intelligence Officer demonstrates with another of his
COMPUTER GRAPHICS.

				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
		The warhead vents the plague
		bacteria above the target area,
		infecting about 50,000 people. First
		symptoms are vomiting, lymph nodes
		become swollen; temperature rises to
		105. Victims turn deep purple from
		lung hemorrhaging, usually die the
		same day.
			(beat)
		There are treatments -- streptomycin
		and tetracyclines -- but we'd be
		overwhelmed by the numbers and its
		extreme contagiousness.

				CIA CHIEF
		We could have 500,000 infected in a
		week, who knows how many after that.

Long beat as everyone tries to contemplate the unthinkable.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		I'm gonna toast those fuckers! Have
		the Summit leaders been warned?



				FBI CHIEF
		Yes, sir... no one's landing in L.A.
		'til we give the all-clear.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		And you're sure it's safe if we can
		get 'em to destroy the missile in
		flight?

				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
		The bacteria can't survive the heat
		of an explosion.

				CIA CHIEF
		I suggest none of this go any
		further -- not even to the agents
		working to find the family. Word
		leaks out to a city of 12 million
		people there's rocket full of the
		Plague coming at 'em, you'll create
		a panic of biblical proportions.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Everyone is painfully on edge. Ambassador Han paces. The FBI
agents are on a phone or a radio, working leads.

Colonel Lee mutters something to Ambassador Han in Korean.

				CARSON
		Say what?

				COLONEL LEE
		Perhaps someone will decide it is
		foolish to incur the wrath of North
		Korea.

				CARSON
			(crosses to Colonel Lee)
		Yeah, the U.S. is behind the whole

				WALTHER
		Carson...

				CARSON
		Let's grab a few beers, kick back
		'til five o'clock rolls by. Then
		maybe we can have a war over it. I

				COLONEL LEE
			(gets up)
		Why wait until five?

Ambassador Han and Walther keep Carson and Colonel Lee from
going at each other.

				MIRANDA
		Pete!
			(sotto)
		Christ, you're self-indulgent!
		There's nothing but anger and

				CARSON
		Hey, I'm not the only one with a rep
		around the office... "Dr. Knoll-It-
		All."

				MIRANDA

		You've been dying to tell me that...

She walks away. Carson immediately regrets saying it.

				CARSON
		Miranda...
			(to himself)
		Shit.

EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

LAPD cruisers squeeze through the crowded streets, fanning out
through the various parties around town. COPS walk through the
crowds with copies of the picture Javal faxed, and photos of
the Han family and Lisa.

EXT.  SKY OVER PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY

The red-tipped cruise missile, flying at 550 MPH, 400 feet
above the water, streaks toward its distant target.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Robbins is still working the phone.

				ROBBINS
			(into phone)
		...Yeah, Peerless Auto Security...
		fine... get your manager...

He puts the receiver down, hits the speakerbox button and the
mute button. He crosses to Dave's desk to grab some papers.

We can hear the CONVERSATION at the alarm shop:

				INSTALLER #1 (VO)
			(thru speakerbox; muffled)
		Tell Jerry, pick up line one!

INT.  AUTO SECURITY SHOP - DAY

A group of young INSTALLERS horse around as they outfit luxury
cars with security systems, high-end audio components, etc.

				INSTALLER #2
		Jerry's outta here!

				INSTALLER #1
		Some cop's asking if we sold a bunch
		of Peerless parts.

				INSTALLER #2
		Talk to Javal!

				INSTALLER #1
		Javal's off today.

				INSTALLER #3
		Dude's off a lot.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

				INSTALLER #4 (VO)

		He's used to it -- fuckin' Frenchies

				INSTALLER #2 (VO)
			(thru speakerbox)
		Man's Canadian, dickweeds!

				INSTALLER #1 (VO)
			(thru speakerbox)
		You're gonna have to call back on
		Monday...

Carson rushes over to the phone. To the others in the room:

				CARSON
		Everyone shut up!
			(into phone)
		Guy on vacation, the Canadian --

				INSTALLER #1 (VO)
			(thru speakerbox)
		-- Yeah, Javal...



				CARSON
			(into phone)
		Six foot, sandy hair, spooky eyes?

				INSTALLER #1 (VO)
			(thru speakerbox; laughs)
		Zombie Eyes! You know the man?

Carson and Miranda look at each other. Bingo!

				CARSON
			(into phone)
		I need a full name, address,
		anything you got!

				INSTALLER #1 (VO)
			(thru speakerbox)
		Paul Javal... hang on, we'll look it
		up... This an immigration thing?
		Shit, he's our best installer.

NEW ANGLE

One of the Korean Espionage Agents answers a RINGING phone on
Colonel Lee's desk, listens, then hits the hold button.

				ESPIONAGE AGENT
		Inspector Carson, extension 666...

				CARSON
		That's appropriate...
			(to Dave)
		In 30 seconds you're gonna give me
		Paul Javal's shoe size.

Carson hurries over, grabs the phone. We SEE him punch the
button for x666.

				CARSON
			(continuing; into phone)
		Carson...

EXT.  FEDERAL BUILDING, WESTWOOD - ESTABLISHING - DAY

				EDWARDS (VO)
		Edwards, Sound Lab...

INT.  FBI SOUND LAB - DAY

EDWARDS, headphones around his neck, sits in front of a wall
of audio analysis equipment.

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru phone)
		Whatta you got?



				EDWARDS
			(into phone)
		Ambient background sound is normal
		city stuff, but there's a distinct
		echo pattern. Your people are in or
		near a high-rise that's at least
		eight floors tall. And there are
		other high-rises nearby.

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru phone)
		How high up are they?

				EDWARDS
			(into phone)
		No way to extrapolate that from the
		sample you gave us.
			(refers to notes)
		One more thing: There's an emergency
		siren approaching at 17 seconds into
		the second call, passing the location
		at 33.5 seconds.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Carson hangs up the phone.

				CARSON
		Okay -- high-rises in our search
		area. Eight stories or higher.

				MIRANDA
		Downtown, Century City, Westwood
		corridor, Museum Row, Mid-
		Wilshire... North of Sunset Strip
		there's a few...

				CARSON
		Sabatini! What about that billboard?

				SABATINI
		Nothing yet! Everyone's left their
		goddamn offices already!

				CARSON
			(to Robbins)
		LAPD will have a record of all
		emergency vehicles running Code 3 at
		9:32 AM. Get their starting point
		and their destination.

				MIRANDA
		And have them narrow their foot-
		searches to areas around high-rises.



				CARSON
			(to Dave)
		Where's that fuckin' address?!

				DAVE
		I'm still holdin'!

Meanwhile, we hear the high-pitched whine as Dave's MODEM
connects with another computer. Dave's fingers fly across the
keyboard, and in a moment, a PICTURE of Javal appears: hair
longer, bearded... but the eyes are unmistakable.

				DAVE
			(continuing)
		He's on our hit parade. Interpol
		passed us his records when he
		entered the country.
			(reads)
		French by birth... looks like a total
		scumbag.

				SABATINI
		Isn't that redundant?

				DAVE
			(reads from computer)
		Raised in Quebec. Moved to Europe;
		served some short stretches, petty
		shit... arrested for kidnapping, no
		conviction. Did four years in France
		for blowing bank vaults. Moved to
		U.S. last year. Clean since then.

				CARSON
		Get his Driver's License number;
		Social; bank accounts; charge cards;
		club memberships... find out what
		movies he rented.  Get whoever's
		closest to the Auto Shop to get in
		there, interview everybody.

				MIRANDA
		This sure was a ballsy move for a
		car-alarm installer.

				CARSON
		Hey, he watched the news... Everyone
		knows the U.S. will do anything to
		avoid trouble with a mad-dog country.

They turn, noticing that Ambassador Han has overheard.

				MIRANDA
		Ambassador --



				CARSON
		-- Quit apologizing for me!

				MIRANDA
		Quit giving me reasons to!

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(to Carson)
		On occasion, my wife has been known
		to kick my ankle under the table.

Miranda gives Carson a "your turn to be gracious" look.

				CARSON
		Sounds like her aim's a little low.

Not exactly what Miranda was hoping for. Dave hands Carson a
piece of paper.

				DAVE
		Address, according to the Auto Shop.

				CARSON
			(looks at paper)
		Apartment 1060! He's in a high-rise!
		Sabatini -- you're with us.
			(off Robbins' disappointed
			look)
		She's got the field experience.

Carson and Miranda grab their jackets, then she stops.

				MIRANDA
		There still could be accomplices.
		If there are, they'll hear us in
		the helicopter.

Carson looks again at the address...

				CARSON
		There's a TV station a couple blocks
		away. We'll land on their pad.
			(to Robbins)
		K-EYE. Clear it with 'em. Have a
		SWAT team assemble, but tell 'em to
		hang back unless we need 'em.

EXT.  OSAKA, JAPAN - ESTABLISHING - DAY

SUPER: Osaka. Western Japan.

INT.  OSAKA APARTMENT - DAY

In the tiny bedroom of a wheelchair-bound JAPANESE TEENAGER,
computers and HAM RADIO equipment are stacked everywhere.

He turns on a tape recorder. We hear a faint, crackling VOICE:



				OPERATIVE'S VOICE (VO)
			(on recorder)
		...Missile heading to L.A. has a
		Kipchak Warhead! Repeat: missile is
		Kipchak equipped!

The Teenager rolls to a computer running CompuServe. He clicks
the CHAT icon, types: "Anyone up on their spy terminology?"

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - LOS ANGELES - DAY

With the gardeners gone, and their sound sensors disabled,
Mrs. Han, Joy and Sam are SHOUTING for help.

They listen for a response; it is completely quiet.

EXT.  K-EYE STUDIOS - LANDING PAD - LOS ANGELES - DAY

Just as the government helicopter lands, Bobbi's news copter
lands right next to it.

Bobbi intercepts Carson, Sabatini, Miranda and Colonel Lee on
the pad. Her Cameraman follows, ENG camera on his shoulder,
videotaping everything.

				CARSON
		Oh, great, the media...
			(realizing)
		It's the goddamn traffic girl!

				MIRANDA
		Traffic person.

				BOBBI
		Where are you going?

				CARSON
		We can't get into that right now...

				BOBBI
		Hey, you expect to use my station's
		facilities and not even tell us --

Carson grabs the ENG camera, pops the videotape out of it and
crushes the tape.

				MIRANDA
			(to Bobbi)
		Sorry...



				BOBBI
			(looks Miranda over)
		What the fuck are you, the Barbie
		Corporate Ass-Lick model?

Miranda is utterly aghast. She reaches under Carson's jacket
and takes the handcuffs off his shoulder rig. She grabs Bobbi
by the arm and gets her in a half-Nelson.

				MIRANDA
		Guess what, Sister... you're about
		to spend the next five years in a
		penitentiary for interfering with a
		federal investigation.

The STATION MANAGER comes running out of the building.

				STATION MANAGER
		Bobbi! I promised we'd respect their
		news blackout!

				BOBBI
			(to herself)
		Figures... you dickless wonder.

Bobbi wriggles out of Miranda's grasp. Carson looks at his
wife, who's still fuming, and smiles to himself.

The Station Manager hands Carson the keys to his Lexus.

				STATION MANAGER
		I get an exclusive later, right?

				CARSON
		This works out, I'll play the
		fuckin' banjo for you.

EXT.  SKY OVER PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY

The cruise missile makes a slight course adjustment.

EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

People begin to arrive at the events. BOOSTERS pass out food,
wine and beer... and crank up the Beach Boys TUNES.

Meanwhile, law enforcement cars move into the areas with high
rises -- Century City, Westwood, downtown, etc.

EXT.  U.S. AIR BASE - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

A sign on the control tower reads: U.S. Air Force, Okinawa.

Flight Crews direct a squadron of planes out onto the flight
line: F-16 fighter bombers, along with F-15 fighter escorts.

They begin to TAKE OFF...



EXT.  FOUNTAIN AVENUE - DAY

The Lexus is stuck in a dense knot of traffic.

Carson gets out and walks across the hoods of the stopped
vehicles around him -- to much COMPLAINING by their owners --
until he finds the reason for the jam-up:

Along the shoulder of the road, a long line of equipment
trailers and motor homes, cables, lights, rent-a-cops and
gawkers. A MOVIE SHOOT. Carson groans.

He hurries back to the Lexus. Miranda rolls her window down.

				CARSON
		We're hoofing it.

Miranda and Colonel Lee immediately get out of the car and run
off, leaving Sabatini to contend with it.

				SABATINI
			(pissed)
		'She's got the field experience'...
		To park the fuckin' car!

EXT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - DAY

A boxy, ten-story complex built in the sixties.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - DAY

Carson, (FBI jacket folded over his arm) Miranda, and Colonel
Lee rush into the lobby.

Carson is about to show the CONCIERGE behind the desk his i.d,
but the Concierge is nervous and sweating. Carson pulls out
his Sig 9mm, approaches the door behind the desk, which is
ajar... He pushes it open...

And finds himself staring at the muzzles of three M-16 rifles.

Three SWAT TEAM members are standing there in full body armor.

				CARSON
			(pulls out his i.d.)
		Whoa... FBI..!

They lower their weapons.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		How the hell you get here so fast?



				SWAT TEAM #1
		They're shootin' a cop movie down
		the street. We're workin' as extras.

				CARSON
		Terrific. Who else is here?

				SWAT TEAM #1
		Three officers on the roof, next
		building over, and two in the tenth-
		floor hallway.

				CARSON
		Tell 'em to be cool. We're going up.
			(to Concierge)
		Give me your master key.

EXT.  ADJACENT APARTMENTS - DAY

The SWAT team SHARPSHOOTERS crouch on the roof.

				SWAT TEAM #1

		Feds going up -- Anglo male and
		female; Asian male.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - DAY

Sabatini drives the Lexus in and parks it in the fire lane.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - HALLWAY - DAY

The fire door opens next to an elevator with the number "10"
on it, and Carson, Miranda and Colonel Lee come out.

Carson and Miranda creep quietly along the hallway, toward
apartment 1060. Carson listens at the door, hears nothing.

He moves to the next door down, apartment 1058, and quietly
unlocks the door.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - #1058 - DAY

The shades are drawn, and the apartment is dark.

As Carson and Miranda cut through the apartment, they realize
there's a WOMAN lying in the bed. She's naked, and she's not
alone. Someone is under the sheets. ANOTHER WOMAN.

The first Woman opens her eyes, sees the intruders, and grabs
for a Colt Gold Cup .45 auto in the dresser drawer.

				WOMAN
		What the fuck..!

Her friend sits up. Miranda holds her finger to her lips and
shows them her FBI shield.

				MIRANDA
		Sorry...

Carson cranks open their window and steps out onto the foot-
wide, ornamental balcony.

				CARSON
			(to Miranda)
		Wait here.

She begins to protest. He shoots her a look that silences her.

EXT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - DAY

The SWAT sharpshooters watch from the next building over as
Carson, ten floors up, peers through the slit in between the
curtains into the window of Javal's apartment.

He swings his legs over onto Javal's ornamental balcony... the
bolts holding the rail onto the wall are loose and rusty...
the balcony SLIPS a little...

He leans on the crank-operated window until it SNAPS open.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - JAVAL'S APARTMENT - DAY

Carson steps inside. He looks around the bedroom -- it's
empty. No furnishings, the closet shelves are bare, even the
pictures on the walls are gone, leaving only their outline.

Carson cautiously goes into the living room --

It's also empty. All that remains are a few cardboard boxes,
and three flower pots in macramÈ ceiling hangers by the living
room window. Some dead leaves lie on the floor beneath them.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		I'm in. It's empty, but sit tight
		while I look around.

Carson cautiously approaches the cardboard boxes.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - #1058 - DAY

The clock on the bedstand reads 4:25. Miranda smiles
uncomfortably at the two naked women together in bed.

				MIRANDA
		I like what you've done with the
		place...



INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - HALLWAY - DAY

The elevator DINGS. Sabatini comes out, H&K MP-5 in hand.

SWAT Team #2, standing on the far side of the hallway with
Colonel Lee, sees her machine pistol and takes aim.

				COLONEL LEE
		Wait!

Colonel Lee walks over to Sabatini.

				SABATINI
		Where's Carson?

				COLONEL LEE
		Inside.

Sabatini starts down the hall. Colonel Lee stays where he is.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - JAVAL'S APARTMENT - DAY

Carson cautiously peers in the moving boxes. They're empty.

He crosses to the front door, looks it over, unlocks the
deadbolt. He turns the knob, the button POPS open...

He stops, noticing a HAIRLINE SEAM in the doorjamb where a
piece was cut, then neatly replaced.

Then, he's startled as he hears a strange, mechanical whining
NOISE coming from the kitchen.

He goes to investigate -- it's an almost-dead, avocado-green
refrigerator straining to start its compressor. He looks for
booby-traps, opens it, and looks inside. Empty.

Looking down, he notices he's got a dead leaf stuck to the
bottom of his shoe.

Glancing in the living room, he sees the dead leaves on the
floor below the three hanging plants. He looks at the plants:
two are dead. The one in the middle is not. It's plastic.

We HEAR the jiggle of the front doorknob.

				CARSON
		NO! --

Too late... The front door opens....

Carson crouches behind the big, heavy refrigerator door...

As the middle flower pot EXPLODES. It's a shrapnel bomb: it
spews thousands of tiny carpet tacks 360 degrees around room.

Sabatini is HIT full on -- she falls backwards into the hall.



INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - #1058 - DAY

Miranda and the women in the darkened bedroom SCREAM as the
tacks tear hundreds of HOLES through sections of the wall.

Tiny shafts of LIGHT appear in the wall, except where it is
covered by furniture (keeping them from being shredded.)

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - HALLWAY - DAY

SWAT Team #2 and Colonel Lee come running, as does Miranda.

Carson is kneeling next to Sabatini. She looks up at him and
tries to say something, but a only long, mournful, final
BREATH escapes her. Agonized, Carson looks around...

And sees Colonel Lee. He lunges for him.

				CARSON
		I said keep everyone back!!

He punches Colonel Lee in the jaw. Colonel Lee slams against
the wall, then comes back at Carson, hitting him in the throat.

				MIRANDA
		Stop it!

Miranda and SWAT Team #2 pull them apart.

				CARSON
			(to Colonel Lee)
		Get out of my sight.

He kneels next to Sabatini, and closes her eyes.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

It's in between reports. The Cameraman listens to the Grateful
Dead on a BOOM BOX. Bobbi answers her ringing CELL PHONE.

				BOBBI

		Marchfelder.

				STATION MANAGER (VO)
			(thru phone)
		You dated the Mayor, right?

				BOBBI
			(sighs; into phone)
		You need a traffic ticket fixed?



				STATION MANAGER (VO)
			(excited; thru phone)
		Try to confirm something for us.
		There's an incredible buzz on the

EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

The streets of Hollywood are even more congested than before,
as the festivities really start rockin'.

INT.  GOVERNMENT HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson and Miranda sit together in the back and Colonel Lee
sits next to the Pilot as they fly back to the Consulate.

Miranda looks at Carson, who's trying real hard not to let
Sabatini's death slow him down.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		What's the status?

				ROBBINS (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Wilshire and West PD Divisions had
		seven vehicles running with sirens at
		9:32. They're getting the routes from
		the officers now.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Hurry it the hell up.

He glances over at Miranda. After a beat:

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		I should've known she'd come up.

				MIRANDA
		Pete --

				CARSON
		-- "Should've." Shit, there's a
		familiar word.
			(long beat)
		That day... I was there soon enough.
		We should've rushed 'em, before they
		could finish setting up...



				MIRANDA
		The Bureau never would've let you.
		They want it by the book: talk them
		out.

Carson looks out the window, not hearing a word she says...

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT./EXT.  BEVERLY THRIFT - (FLASHBACK) - DAY

Carson is in the FBI command truck, talking on the phone to:

A BANK ROBBER, barricaded inside the bank. Phone in hand, he
holds a shotgun on a dozen hostages: BANK EMPLOYEES and
CUSTOMERS -- including a couple of YOUNG KIDS. One is holding
a soccer-sized, rainbow-colored rubber ball.

The OTHER BANK ROBBER wires up a series of explosive charges.

Both Robbers rush inside the vault, and pull the door closed
to protect themselves...

The front of the building, where the hostages are, EXPLODES.

Carson runs to the bank. He spots the kid's ball, rolling in
the street... BURNING. He turns away, horrified, devastated...

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  GOVERNMENT HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

				CARSON
		Twelve bodies -- only the hostages.

				MIRANDA
		You were a greenhorn. It wasn't your
		decision. You can't keep living as
		such a raw nerve, never sleeping --

				CARSON
		-- Those kids were ten years old!
			(sotto)
		Same age as the Han boy...

He turns away. She takes his hand.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

The family continues to call for HELP. As they do, we

							CUT TO:



INT.  HALLWAY JUST OUTSIDE APARTMENT - DAY

Their CRIES echo faintly through a deserted tangle of ladders,
construction equipment, sheets of drywall, etc.

A warning sign taped to the wall near the elevator reads:
     
		This Floor Has Been Temporarily Vacated
		For Minor Earthquake Retrofitting.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

The mood is glum. Carson looks at Robbins, Dave and Walther,
then at the empty chair where Sabatini had been sitting.

				CARSON
		C'mon! Who's pulling Javal's bank
		records? What about cross-referencing
		possible aliases? We got 33 minutes!

Hearing Beach Boys MUSIC on the TV's and radios on the
surveillance console, Carson angrily punches them all off.

Suddenly, Miranda looks at him:

				MIRANDA
		Camry! The billboard! Toyota Camry!
			(reaches for phone)
		Where are the numbers for the
		outdoor ad companies?

				ROBBINS
		Parker Center's making those calls.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Bobbi and the News Cameraman are arguing bitterly:

				BOBBI
		Turn the fuckin' camera on! DO IT!!

				CAMERAMAN
		Maybe it's true... probably is true.
		That's why they got a news blackout!

				BOBBI
		I'll rip your miserable eyeballs
		out! NEWS IS OUR FUCKIN' JOB!!

He sighs and turns the CAMERA on.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - INCLUDE ANGLE ON TV - DAY

The Han family listens to Bobbi, amazed, horrified...



				BOBBI
			(on TV)
		...A warning was radioed to U.S.
		Intelligence that a biological weapon,
		allegedly containing the deadly
		Pneumonic Plague, is approaching Los
		Angeles. While unconfirmed, the
		President and other leaders are all
		late in arriving...

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

The TV's are off -- so they see none of Bobbi's report.

Carson crosses to Dave. He's at his computer, looking at a
long column of telephone numbers.

				DAVE
		Finally got the call list from
		Javal's phone. Most aren't his;
		they're from the legit user who
		didn't know his number was cloned.

				CARSON
		Go to the bottom of the list, work
		back through the last 12 hours.

Dave jumps to the bottom, points at a number.

				DAVE
		Here's the call to the Consulate --
		965-5000.
			(while scrolling)
		The rest are dupes... all from the
		other guy...

				CARSON
		Wait... go back... the one at seven
		this morning...

Dave highlights a number: 213-965-5666.

WIDER

Carson glances over at the telephone on Colonel Lee's desk.

(FLASHBACK) - CLOSE ON PHONE

from when Carson took a call there, pushing the mute button.

(FLASHBACK) - EXTREME CLOSE UP

on the label showing the phone's extension number: "x666."



BACK TO SCENE

Across the room, Colonel Lee is watching Carson intently.

Carson turns to look at him. They make eye contact.

Time stands still.

Realization.

Feeling like he's moving in SLOW MOTION, Carson reaches for
the Sig 9mm in his shoulder holster.

Colonel Lee grabs the AMD-74 machine gun on the desk.

				CARSON
		Get down!

Colonel Lee STRAFES the room and backs toward the door.

The BULLETS trace a line across the room. One of the North
Korean Espionage Agents is HIT. He slams against the console.

Carson tackles Ambassador Han and shoves him onto the floor,
while popping off several ROUNDS in Colonel Lee's direction.

Robbins also dives for cover, pushing Walther down first.
Robbins takes a BULLET in the shoulder.

Miranda is HIT. The impact tumbles her over the desk.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		MIRANDA!

Colonel Lee, still FIRING, slips out the door.

Gunsmoke hangs in the air as Carson scrambles to Miranda.
Several PHONES have begun ringing. No one notices them.

Dave never moved -- he sits hunched over, clutching his
notebook computer, muttering the HAIL MARY.

Carson rolls Miranda over. She's got a large, scorched bullet
hole in the front of her blouse. Carson tears her blouse open.
She's wearing a kelvar vest under it, and the slug is
mushroomed against the vest.

She awakens, GASPS and starts swinging her fists at him.
Carson is overwhelmed with relief.

Then he notices Robbins, bleeding profusely, propped against
the wall next to Walther. Walther is dead -- shot in the head.

OS, we hear several SPURTS of machine gun fire, and a car
ENGINE roaring to life. Miranda looks at Carson...

				MIRANDA
		Go..!

EXT.  WILSHIRE BLVD - DAY

The city's reaction to Bobbi's announcement is immediate and
severe. It makes the panic during the '92 riots look like a
drive in the country.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Carson bursts through the door just as the second armored
Mercedes CRASHES through the wrought-iron entry gates. Carson
fires several SHOTS, which ping harmlessly off the Mercedes.

Carson sprints for a car. Miranda's Volvo is the closest one.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - DAY

As Carson is starting it, the passenger door opens and
Ambassador Han gets in.

				CARSON
		Get the fuck out of here!

Ambassador Han responds by putting on his seat belt. Carson
sighs and tears out of the driveway.

EXT.  FREMONT PLACE - DAY

Colonel Lee crashes through the Fremont Place guard gate, then
hangs a right on Wilshire. He drives the center turn lane,
zooming past the snarl of cars.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

In the back of the Consulate, Miranda, sore as hell, climbs
into the government copter. It WHINES to life and TAKES OFF.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson looks around at the chaos around them.

				CARSON
		Shit, it's like a Godzilla movie out
		here!

Then he HEARS, on a nearby car's FM RADIO:



				FM NEWSCASTER (VO)
			(thru car radio)
		...These words, which have terrified
		the city:

				RECORDING OF BOBBI (VO)
			(thru car radio)

face in his hands.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Miranda..!

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru radio)
		I heard. I'm in the copter.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		I want you to get out of here...

INT.  GOVERNMENT HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Miranda is flying just behind Carson's Volvo. The TRAFFIC is
beyond nightmarish. She smiles at his concern for her.

				MIRANDA
			(into radio)
		Shut up and keep your eyes on the
		road. That's my goddamn car.
			(beat; into radio)
		Dave? You staying on top of the
		research?

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Sweating, Dave is watching the ACTION outside on a TV while
hurriedly bandaging Robbins' shoulder with some torn cloth. He
grabs for the two-way and we realize he's panicking.

				DAVE
			(into radio)
		I can't... My kids...

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru radio; calmly)
		Listen: the best way to help them is
		to stay at your computer. If any

He squeezes his eyes shut... After a long beat:



				DAVE
			(into radio)
		Okay...

EXT.  SKY OVER LOS ANGELES - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Several large military helicopters approach -- troop
contingents from Pendleton and Ft. Irwin.

The big CH-54 dual-rotor copters set down and offload MARINES
and ARMY INFANTRY.

Others, like Apache Gunship combat copters and Hueys, begin to
follow the pursuit. They join the police and TV copters, and
it looks like the Ride of the Valkyries.

EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

People flee from the festivities in droves. Seeing the
helicopters and TROOPS in bio suits only fuels the hysteria.

We hear news REPORTS coming from car radios, boom boxes, TV's.
Reporters chatter urgently in English, Spanish, Japanese,
Korean, Farsi, their voices mixing with the shouts of
pedestrians, the rumbling and horn-blowing of the traffic...

Everyone, everywhere is getting into their cars in a mad dash
to get out of town or rendezvous with loved ones.

This is the mother of all rush hours.

EXT.  WESTERN AVENUE - DAY

Colonel Lee's car turns right onto Western Avenue. He's in the
heart of Koreatown -- hardly any of the signs are in English.

He swerves through the panicked drivers jamming the roads --
in the center lane, or into the oncoming traffic. The cars he
HITS crumple against the Mercedes without slowing it down.

Carson's Volvo follows, squeezing through traffic in its wake.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) DAY

Bobbi is salivating with excitement (and antacid.) She snaps
off her mic and yells at her Cameraman:

				BOBBI
		Don't lose the Benz, moron... pull
		back... show the other copters around
		us... this is fuckin' great...

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Ambassador Han looks glumly at the chaos in the streets.



				CARSON
		...The Colonel hired Javal, made it
		look like he was working alone. Then
		he made sure Javal got killed, so
		we'd never find your family -- and
		they'd have an excuse to drop their
		bomb. But what's in it for 'em?

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		There are men in my government whose
		power depends on North Korea staying
		as it is: Socialist, repressive,
		isolated from the world. They'll
		resort to anything, even war, to
		keep it that way. They have the
		Hitler Syndrome: if their country
		cannot exist the way they want it,
		they would rather see it destroyed.

EXT.  WESTERN AVENUE - DAY

Colonel Lee gets stuck in a line of cars trying to get onto

INT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - DAY

Colonel Lee sees the Apache helicopter approach. He leans into
the back seat, knocking the top off a long, plastic crate.



INT.  APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

The SUNROOF on the Mercedes slides open. Colonel Lee's upper
body pokes through the sunroof. He's holding a manportable
S.A.M. -- a 3-foot-long, fiberglass rocket launcher.

Vreeland tries to bring his machine guns to bear on Colonel
Lee, but there's no time...

				VREELAND
			(to Pilot)
		Shit! Pull back!

EXT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - DAY

Colonel Lee depresses the trigger on the launcher and a
rolling-pin-sized rocket is EXPELLED.

EXT.  SKY ABOVE WESTERN AVENUE - DAY

The rocket SLAMS into a police helicopter just in front of the
Apache, creating a huge FIREBALL, turning the copter into two
tons of red-hot shrapnel.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - DAY

Carson and Ambassador Han watch with horror.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

A hundred yards away, they're BUFFETED by the explosion.

		now. Back to you, Brent.

EXT.  WESTERN AVENUE - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

The burning hull of the police copter CRASHES into a mini-
mall, causing a FIRE and EXPLOSION.

EXT.  HELICOPTERS - DAY

Vreeland's Apache and the remaining helicopters scramble away.

				VREELAND
			(into radio)
		Out of the air, or retreat 7,000

The copters set down in parking lots, rooftops, wherever.
Armed troops climb out to keep PANICKED MOBS from swarming
them in an attempt to leave the city.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - INCLUDE ANGLE ON TV - DAY

The Han family watches the TV, amazed, as Colonel Lee ducks
back down into the Mercedes and closes the sunroof.

				JOY
		I always hated that guy...

EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

Other drivers, not knowing whether Colonel Lee's rocket is the
biological missile, scatter away from him. Colonel Lee
squeezes onto the freeway on-ramp.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Pieces of burning DEBRIS are still landing nearby. Carson
looks at Ambassador Han:

				CARSON
		One of yours?
			(Han nods)
		What the hell do you need heat-
		seeking rockets for in L.A.?

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		There could be another riot...

				CARSON
			(shakes his head)
		And they call me Mr. Overkill.
			(into radio)
		Dave, what do you know about...

He looks at Han.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		Strela-2...

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Strela-2 anti-aircraft rockets?

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Dave, calmer but still sweating, taps at his computer. A
schematic of Colonel Lee's rocket launcher appears on it.

INT.  POLICE CRUISER - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Miranda has hitched a ride in a black-and-white.

				MIRANDA
			(into radio)
		Stay back. LAPD's putting up a
		roadblock.

EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

Several police cars clear a path for two huge, yellow DWP
BULLDOZERS borrowed from a construction cite.

They rumble up onto the eastbound freeway, turn, and then
stop, side by side, facing oncoming traffic. They lower their
huge front shovels to create a roadblock.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - CLOSE - DAY

Bobbi sits impatiently, microphone in hand...

WIDER

The copter has landed behind an AM-PM Minimart/gas station.

Bobbi, her Pilot and her Cameraman turn when they hear a
KNOCKING on the windshield of their copter...

Oblivious to the panic on the streets, a raggedy HOMELESS GUY
stands with a spray bottle, wanting to wash the windows on the
copter. Bobbi gulps some Mylanta and waves him away:

				BOBBI
		Save it for someone who gives a
		shit!



EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

All of the celebration locales are trampled, abandoned messes.
So much for "Fun Fun Fun" and L.A. putting on its best.

MOBS make panicked runs on the stock in grocery, drug and
hardware stores. Violence breaks out in the aisles and parking
lots.

PEOPLE in their homes work feverishly to seal their doors and
windows against the plague with tape, towels, plastic.

INT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Colonel Lee screeches to a stop 500 feet from the bulldozers,
angling the Mercedes so the driver's door is facing them.

EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

The windows on the Mercedes glide open....

Carson hurries to catch up to it...

Colonel Lee FIRES a rocket at the bulldozers through the
driver's side window. The BACKBLAST from the launcher vents
through the passenger's side.

The ROCKET impacts the bulldozer on the left; the EXPLOSION
actually FLIPS the huge machine head over tail into the air.

The bulldozer lands upside down on the lane divider, crushing
a portion of it.

Colonel Lee rolls up his windows and drives around the burning
wreckage.

The other drivers really give him wide berth now...

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Approaching downtown, Colonel Lee turns onto the 110 north.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Traffic moves aside for Colonel Lee's notorious Mercedes.
Carson catches up to it.

				DAVE (VO)
			(thru radio)
		...The Strela-2 needs 45 meters to
		arm, so stay tight on his ass.

Carson SLAMS his Volvo into the Mercedes. Ambassador Han
braces himself on the dashboard. Carson looks over at him.



				CARSON
		That Kraut-mobile have any weaknesses
		you'd like to tell me about?

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		I don't think so -- they said it was
		solid as a rock.

				CARSON
			(looks at his crumpled car)
		No shit...

As Carson moves forward, Colonel Lee's window opens enough to
allow the barrel of his AMD-74 machine gun to poke through.

Carson shoves Ambassador Han's head down and ducks. Colonel
Lee STRAFES the Volvo.

Carson looks up just in time to see...

A pickup truck, ahead, stalled on the shoulder.

Carson slams on the brakes, but it's too late... The Volvo
CRASHES headfirst into the back of the truck.

The Volvo's AIRBAGS deploy, stopping Carson and Ambassador Han
from plowing into the dashboard. After a beat:

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(dazed)
		I can't believe I'm still alive...

				CARSON
		This were a Hyundai you wouldn't be.

Ambassador Han looks at Carson, wondering if he's putting him
on. The car is a twisted mess. Carson can't get the door open.

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

A red and white LAFD paramedic's ambulance puts on its SIREN
and hurries to the Volvo. Two PARAMEDICS jump out.

				CARSON
		Get me out of here...

They pry his door open with a crowbar. Carson climbs onto the
roof of his car. Grimacing from pain, he looks around.

				CARSON
			(continuing; into radio)
		Anybody see him?

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Still heading north on the 110.

The Paramedics pry the passenger door open and help Ambassador
Han out. Carson looks at the ambulance. He's getting an idea...

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Dave... You're sure those rockets
		are heat-seeking?

				DAVE (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Classic IR, reflective optical
		system. How come?

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Just keep working your leads...

Carson climbs into the back of the ambulance.

INT.  AMBULANCE - DAY

Carson rummages through the supplies, finds what he's looking
for, and (BELOW FRAME) starts stuffing them into a canvas bag.

EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

Carson climbs onto the roof of the ambulance.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		This is Carson. I need a copter.

EXT.  HELICOPTERS - (VARIOUS ANGLES) - DAY

Everyone in the grounded helicopters -- LAPD, National Guard,
Marines, media -- react to Carson's request as if he's crazy.

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Something small and nimble.
		Anybody... come in low, from the
		south... I'm on an ambulance by the
		9th Street exit.

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Are you out of your mind?

INT.  NEWS COPTER - DAY

Bobbi is standing next to her copter in the back of the
minimart, listening to this exchange on a POLICE SCANNER. Her
Cameraman is eating a microwave burrito. Bobbi jumps in, grabs
the ENG camera, and yells at her Pilot:



				BOBBI
		Get this fuckin' thing in the air!
			(to Cameraman)
		Out! Not enough room for four.

				CAMERAMAN
			(as they TAKE OFF)
		What am I supposed to do when the
		plague comes, hold my breath?

INT.  POLICE CRUISER - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

They rapidly cut through the traffic.

				MIRANDA
			(into radio)
		Switch to a secure channel.
			(flips a switch)
		What on earth are you thinking?

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru radio)
		I'll make him open the sunroof.
		Someone can shoot tear gas or a
		percussion grenade inside.

				MIRANDA
			(into radio)
		Pete, you haven't gone... suicidal or
		anything on me, have you?

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru radio)
		No way. I couldn't stand making so
		many people happy.

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Carson waves his arms as he sees a helicopter approaching.

The glare from the sun masks the copter's markings. It HOVERS
above him. With the canvas bag slung over his shoulder, Carson
jumps up onto the runner, then climbs up inside the cockpit.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson closes the door, then sees Bobbi.

				CARSON
		You?! I wanted a police copter!

				PILOT
		Just tell me what to do. I flew two
		tours in 'Nam.



				BOBBI
		And he doesn't go unless I go!

				CARSON
		Wrong-o...

							CUT TO:

EXT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

The door opens and Bobbi comes TUMBLING out of it!

WIDER

They're hovering above the roof of a high-rise hotel downtown.
Bobbi lands with a huge SPLASH in the rooftop swimming pool.

BOBBI

surfaces, sputtering and screaming:

				BOBBI
		I'm a respected electronic
		journalist, you fuckin' prick!!

Carson replies by tossing her industrial-sized bottle of
Mylanta out after her.

EXT.  SKY ABOVE OCEAN - FOLLOW CRUISE MISSILE - DAY

In the distance, there is smog on the horizon.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

They follow the 110 north. Ahead, Carson sees the Mercedes
cutting across lanes.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Got 'im -- looks like he's headed
		for the 101.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson has the Pilot hover just above and behind the Mercedes.
It comes to a stop and the sunroof opens up.

Carson lashes himself to the copter's center post with a piece
of the seat harness, then slides the door open.

He reaches into the canvas bag and takes out a road flare. He
breaks the flare open, IGNITING it.



				CARSON
			(to Pilot)
		Pull hard to the left, on my
		signal...

He braces himself on door jamb...

Below, Colonel Lee's head pokes up from the sunroof.

EXT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - DAY

Colonel Lee calmly aims the rocket launcher and FIRES.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson tosses the lit flare, hard, away from the helicopter.

				CARSON
		Now!

The Pilot swings the helicopter in the other direction, and
the rocket FOLLOWS the flare, streaking past the helicopter.

A few seconds later, the rocket EXPLODES in midair behind them.

INT.  POLICE CRUISER - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Miranda sees what Carson is doing.

				MIRANDA
		You fucking lunatic!!

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

The News Pilot looks over at Carson.

				PILOT
		Hope you got more flares than he's
		got rockets.

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Miranda and the L.A. Cop, both holding small tear gas pistols,
split up. Crouching behind the cars on the freeway, they sneak
up on the stopped Mercedes.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson takes another flare out of the canvas bag. He breaks
the top off... and it doesn't ignite.

Below, Colonel Lee loads another rocket into the launcher...



EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Miranda is climbing the metal stairs leading to a graffiti-
covered freeway sign.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson fumbles to pull another flare out of the canvas bag.

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Avoiding coils of razor-sharp concertina wire around the sign,
Miranda FIRES a tear gas canister at the Mercedes' sunroof.

It misses, bouncing off the windshield, filling the area with
white smoke. Colonel Lee keeps his eye on the copter...

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson gets the new flare lit and throws it away from the
copter just as Colonel Lee FIRES another rocket.

The rocket EXPLODES a few dozen yards away. Shrapnel PEPPERS
the copter, DAMAGING the rear rotor.

Struggling to maintain control, the Pilot heads for the Sixth
Street on-ramp, below the freeway, out of the line of fire.

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Colonel Lee spots Miranda, up on the freeway sign, loading
another tear gas canister. He STRAFES the sign.

She flattens; the BULLETS tear through the sign above her.

The L.A. Cop rushes the Mercedes. Colonel Lee FIRES at him,
hitting him across the legs.

Colonel Lee ducks back into the Mercedes and drives away.

VARIOUS ANGLES

As Miranda comes down from the sign...

Carson climbs up the embankment from Sixth Street to the 101...

The downed L.A. Cop waves as a pair of ambulances drive up,
lights flashing and sirens WAILING.

Carson runs alongside one of the ambulances, pulling the
driver's door open before it's stopped.

The Paramedic is the one who helped him and Ambassador Han out
of the Volvo. Carson yanks him out of his ambulance.



				MIRANDA
		Sorry...

INT.  AMBULANCE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson jumps in. Miranda climbs in the passenger's side. As he
peels away, Miranda smacks Carson on the head.

				MIRANDA
		You're completely deranged! Playing
		chicken with rockets!

				CARSON
		Well, what the hell were you doing
		out there?

				AMBASSADOR HAN (OS)
		What are both of you doing?

Carson turns, surprised and annoyed to see Ambassador Han, his
arm bandaged, lying in the cot in the back.

				CARSON
		Oh, for Christ's sake... Hold on!

Lights and SIRENS going, they rush into the 110/101 interchange.

Ahead, Colonel Lee's Mercedes is driving through the cars that
are parting like the Red Sea for him.

				MIRANDA
		Even if we can pry him out with...
			(looks at her watch)
		Twelve minutes to go, I doubt he'll
		be very cooperative.

				CARSON
		I'll just use my outstanding people
		skills.

Carson glances up at the sign showing the upcoming exit:
Glendale Blvd - Echo Park. A thought is forming...

				CARSON
			(continuing; to Ambassador
			Han)
		That car's like a rock, right?

EXT.  HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - DAY

Carson suddenly cuts to the left. When they reach the Glendale
Blvd exit, he SLAMS the ambulance into the side of the
Mercedes, forcing it onto the freeway off-ramp.



INT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson pushes the Mercedes across Bellevue Avenue, toward the
park surrounding Echo Lake. Colonel Lee STRAFES the ambulance.

EXT.  GLENDALE BLVD - DAY

Carson keeps BUMPING the Mercedes as they reach Glendale Blvd,
running right alongside the lake.

With a hard shove, Carson sends the Mercedes SKIDDING off the
road, through the small guardrail, and INTO the lake.

Carson slams on the brakes, fishtailing the ambulance into the
grass surrounding the lake. Sig 9mm in hand, he hops out.

The Mercedes is so heavy that it's already half-submerged.

INT./EXT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - DAY

WATER pours in from the floorboards, the air vents...

Colonel Lee climbs out through the sunroof and FIRES at Carson
with his AMD-74.

EXT.  ECHO LAKE - DAY

Carson ducks behind the ambulance, takes careful aim...

And SHOOTS Colonel Lee, WINGING him in the shoulder. Colonel
Lee's machine gun goes flying, and he tumbles into the water.

Meanwhile, Cops, Army, Marines, etc. arrive via helicopter and
car. Major Vreeland is among them. The news media, ENG cameras
bouncing on their shoulders, run alongside them.

CLOSER

Carson races over to grab Colonel Lee, who is slogging out of
the lake. There is a glint of bright steel... and Colonel Lee
SLASHES at Carson with a knife.

Carson moves aside... but the knife SLICES across his upper
arm. Carson falls backwards.

Colonel Lee, on hands and knees, tries to crawl away. Suddenly,
someone KICKS him in face, flipping him over.

It's Miranda. Colonel Lee's knife goes flying.

Carson, bleeding, piles onto Colonel Lee. Vreeland assists.
Colonel Lee fights like mad to break free...

Until Miranda JAMS her heel into his groin. He cries out.



				MIRANDA
		Ever hear of "fuck-me" pumps?
		Well, these are fuck you pumps!
			(pushes harder)
		Where's the family?

Surprised at his wife's new negotiating technique, Carson
shoots a look at Vreeland. Vreeland grimaces.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Dave sits in front of his computer, phone receiver resting on
his shoulder, riveted by the ACTION on the TV.

				DAVE
		Holy shit -- Knoll-It-All's turned

He turns as his MODEM squawks and another download comes in.

				DAVE
			(continuing; into phone)
		You're sure there were no accounts in
		the other names I gave you?

EXT.  ECHO LAKE - DAY

While Miranda continues to apply encouragement to Colonel
Lee's gonads, Ambassador Han limps over. He yells some ORDERS
at Colonel Lee. After a moment, Colonel Lee sags.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		Let him up.

Carson's not so sure, but they're completely surrounded by
military and law enforcement personnel. He releases his grasp.
Miranda removes her heel.

Then, with lightning reflexes, Colonel Lee grabs Vreeland's
Rock Island Arsenal Colt .45 Auto from its snap-holster.

				COLONEL LEE
		Victory!

Carson dives back onto him. But he twists his arm around and
PULLS the trigger -- with the muzzle underneath his own chin.

Carson, Miranda and Ambassador Han are SPRAYED with his blood.

WIDER

Dumbfounded everybody looks at each other...

Carson, dogged, kneels next to Colonel Lee's body and searches
through his pockets, looking for something, anything.



EXT.  SKY ABOVE OCEAN - FOLLOW CRUISE MISSILE - DAY

Ahead, in the distance, the coastline comes into view.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

No answer.

EXT.  PARK LA BREA - DAY

Police cars, military vehicles, fire trucks, etc. converge on
the complex from all directions.

Several helicopters circle the complex. One has a PA in it:

				VOICE THRU PA
		Han family. Show us your location...

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

The family listens, frustrated, as the HELICOPTERS circle (OS).

Joy carefully slides her arm along the arm rest, then tries to
coax something out of her pocket -- her Zippo lighter.

				JOY
		Mother... Sam...

They look over at her as she lights it. After a beat, Mrs. Han
understands... She hesitates, then:

				MRS. HAN
		Do it.

Joy drops the lighter to the floor, then swats it with her
foot to Mrs. Han. She does the same, passing it to Sam, who's
sitting closest to the window.

With one eye on the VU movement meter, Sam kicks the lighter,
sliding it across the carpet toward the curtains.

INT.  PARK LA BREA OFFICE - DAY

Several COPS and MARINES burst into the office. Milton, the
Assistant Manager, cowers as they SHOOT the lock off the door
to the inner office and rush in.

				MILTON
		It's a brown binder... Says "Rental
		Manifest." You can't miss it...

They literally tear the office apart.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

The FIRE is consuming the curtains. Thick, toxic SMOKE begins
to fill the tiny apartment, and everyone starts coughing.

INT.  APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

They circle, overwhelmed by the sheer number of apartments.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Apartment number would be real

Miranda points to a wisp of SMOKE above one of the towers.

		There!

They come around, and spot the FIRE in the apartment's window.
It is nine stories up, four stories below the top floor.

EXT.  SKY ABOVE OCEAN - FOLLOW CRUISE MISSILE - DAY

The coast looms closer.

EXT.  PARK LA BREA - INCLUDE APACHE HELICOPTER - DAY

The Apache hovers parallel to the apartment, 20 feet away.
Carson feeds out a steel cable from a winch...

Then throws a spring-loaded grappling hook onto the thick,
iron balcony railing.

Hanging onto a webbed rescue harness, Carson slides quickly
across the line, onto the balcony. Using the butt of his Sig
9mm, he BREAKS a hole in the glass on the locked sliding glass
door. He reaches through and unlatches it.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

The FLAMES have engulfed both sets of curtains and have begun
to creep across the floor and the ceiling.

Carson glances over at the electronics on the TV: 4:55 PM.

The family is coughing from the smoke, trying not to panic.

In the kitchen, Lisa can't cough through the tape on her
mouth. She's freaking out.

Seeing this, Carson runs over to her and pulls the tape off.
She starts SCREAMING, so he grabs her face.

				CARSON
		Okay... work with me here!

He grabs one of the refrigerator handles and pulls, but it
won't come loose. Lisa cries out in frustration.

				LISA
		Hurry, please hurry...

Carson spots Javal's toolbox. In it, he finds a socket set
handle, which he levers in between the refrigerator handle and
the door. He rips one handle loose, then the other.

Carson turns his attention to the booby-trapped chairs.

Lisa sits on the floor, frantically pulling her handcuffed
hands around her feet so they're in front of her, then runs
for the front door. Just as she reaches it:

				CARSON
		DON'T!

He grabs her before she opens the door. There's a small
magnetic sensor at the top of the door jamb.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		We have to go out the window.

				MRS. HAN
		Can't you disarm the bomb?



				CARSON
		Too risky. Let's concentrate on
		getting you out of here.

He looks at the meters on the electronic units.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		Sound detectors?

				MRS. HAN
		Sam covered them with chewing gum.

				SAM
		High-tech problem, low-tech solution.

Carson looks at Sam, impressed, then peers under the chairs.

				CARSON
		Pressure sensors. Use 'em in
		convertibles: Bad guy sits on your
		seat, he sets the alarm off. These
		are rigged backwards -- get up, you
		set 'em off.

				SAM
		You a bomb expert?

				CARSON
		Nope. But I've had some car alarms
		in my day.
			(to himself)
		For all the goddamn good they do...

Carson looks around, thinking. He spots the roll of duct tape
on the table, grabs it and unrolls a long piece.

				CARSON
			(continuing; to Mrs. Han)
		Slide your arm forward... Watch the
		meter... Keep the pressure on the
		armrest with your elbow...

He wraps the armrest with tape, cinching it tight.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		It'll squeeze the sensor, duplicate
		the weight of your arm... Okay...
		pick it up.

They look at each other, scared... After a beat, she does.

The meter JIGGLES... but stays in the black! Everyone sighs
with relief. Carson repeats the process on her other armrest.



				CARSON
			(continuing; to Sam)
		Low-tech solution...
			(to Mrs. Han)
		Lean back... Carefully.

Carson feels for the sensor in the seat, finding it buried
under Mrs. Han's thighs. He runs a long piece of tape around
the seat and wraps it tightly.

He tries to lift Mrs. Han, but the meter moves to the red.

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru radio in his pocket)
		How's it going in there?

				CARSON
			(to himself)
		Nag, nag, nag...

He wraps another piece of tape around the seat, and tries
again to lift her. This time it works!

EXT.  SKY ABOVE OCEAN - FOLLOW CRUISE MISSILE - DAY

The missile has almost reached land.

EXT.  U.S. FIGHTER BOMBERS - SKY OVER SEA OF JAPAN - DAY

Traveling toward the Korean DMZ.

INT./EXT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - INCLUDE APACHE HELICOPTER -
DAY

Time: 4:58. The Apache helicopter HOVERING outside is making
an incredible racket.

Carson is helping Joy get free of her chair. As she stands,
the pieces of her hair stuck to the gum over the microphone
head begin to PULL the gum away!

Mrs. Han sees the meter heading for the red, and the yellow
warning light flashing... She grabs Carson's arm.

Carson quickly covers the mic... The meter drops to zero.

WIDER

The FIRE is spreading across the carpet and walls. Carson is
hurrying everyone out onto the small balcony. He helps Lisa
into the rescue harness. She's terrified.

				CARSON
		You'll be over in five seconds...

She nods. Miranda pulls her across the cable and send the
harness back. Carson turns next to Sam, but he stands back so
his sister can go.

ANGLE ON BOMB

One minute... fifty-nine seconds...

CARSON

sends Sam across... the harness comes back... he straps Mrs.
Han into it...

				CARSON
		Tell 'em I'm gonna release the hook
		and ride down on the line.

He pushes her across. As soon as she's there, he gestures to
the Apache Pilot to move closer so he can release the hook.

ANGLE ON BOMB

Thirty seconds... twenty-nine...

THE HARNESS

slides back across to him; Carson grabs it with one hand and
tries to undo the hook buckle with the other...

But the cable is crooked, and the buckle is JAMMED -- if he
can't release it, he's stuck there! Carson tries to free the
hook, but it's dug in between the concrete and the railing.

Fifteen seconds to go...

Carson looks over at the helicopter and waves them away.

				CARSON
			(shouts)
		Release the cable from your side!
		Get out of here!

				MIRANDA
			(shouts back)
		Come over the railing! Grab onto the
		harness!

INT.  APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Miranda turns to the Pilot.

				MIRANDA
		Tear the hook loose!



				PILOT
		It'll pop the winch buckle!

				MIRANDA
		Try it anyway!

INT./EXT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - INCLUDE APACHE HELICOPTER -
DAY

Five seconds to go...

The Apache helicopter backs away from the high-rise...

The cable pulls taut...

Carson wraps the webbing of the harness around his wrist...

The Apache STRAINS against the resistance of the cable...

The entire railing around the balcony BREAKS away, with Carson
HANGING on the harness next to it...

The helicopter turns and flies away...

EXT.  PARK LA BREA - DAY

The bomb EXPLODES, blasting a huge hole in the tower.

All the windows in the nearby towers and apartments IMPLODE.

CARSON

is engulfed in the FIREBALL... We can't tell if he's alive.

INT./EXT.  APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

The force of the blast HITS them like a tidal wave. The Pilot
fights to keep control while looking for a place to set down.

BELOW

Huge chunks of debris, glass, furniture, etc. rain down.

Carson and the section of railing underneath the helicopter
swing like a pendulum from the force of the blast.

Groggy, he loosens his grasp on the harness, and jumps clear
as the helicopter lands.

Miranda leaps out of the Apache and runs to him...

WIDER

Dust and debris from the explosion hang in the air;
helicopters crisscross the scene.

Everyone turns their eyes skyward, looking for the missile...



INT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - P'YÚNGYANG - (INCLUDE TV) -
DAY

The Premier and the High Command are watching the action at
Park LaBrea on CNN Live...

...As Ambassador Han embraces his family.

Furious, General Kai gets up and leaves the conference room.

The others look at the Premier. After a beat, he crosses to a
PANEL OF ELECTRONICS and SLAPS a large red button on it...

EXT.  SKY ABOVE SANTA MONICA - DAY

The cruise missile EXPLODES, completely obliterating it.

EXT.  U.S. FIGHTER BOMBERS - SKY OVER SEA OF JAPAN - DAY

The lead jet cuts away, turning around. The others follow.

EXT.  PARK LA BREA - DAY

The Han family crosses to Carson, blackened and bloody,
sitting on the curb next to Miranda. Ambassador Han shakes
his hand. Mrs. Han and Miranda cry. Joy and Sam grin at him.
After a beat, Carson gathers the kids up in his arms. It is a
profound catharsis for him...

EXT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - P'YÚNGYANG - DAY

General Kai is getting into his car. He look up as an ARMY
OFFICER approaches... and SHOOTS him! The Officer pushes his
body into the passenger's seat, gets in, and drives off.

							FADE THRU TO:

DARKNESS

and the sound of RUNNING WATER.

EXT.  PASTORAL SCENE - DAY

A beautiful ranch house and horse barn, sitting on a meadow
beside a brook, overlooking an unspoiled pine forest.

INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

The pastoral scene is a COMMERCIAL on the TV.

Carson, wrapped in a towel, holds the phone and paces.

				CARSON
			(into phone)
		...I'll call you next week.

Carson hangs up, and CLICKS off the TV as he leaves the room.
The sound of RUNNING WATER continues (OS)...

EXT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - PATIO - NIGHT

Miranda, wearing a bathrobe, is WATERING her sickly roses.
Carson comes outside.

				MIRANDA
		Who was that on the phone?

				CARSON
		The Bureau.
			(beat)
		They want me back on the hostage
		team.

				MIRANDA
		What did you say?

				CARSON
		Told 'em I'd sleep on it...

Miranda smiles, then looks at him, surprised, as he crouches
down and helps her turn the soil around the rose bushes. They
work in silence. Then, tentatively, she leans over and kisses
him. Soon they're in each other's arms, holding tight...

INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Still entwined, Carson and Miranda stumble in. While kissing:

				MIRANDA
		Working with you today was
		certainly... interesting, Inspector.

				CARSON
		It's my outstanding people skills.

He slips her out of her robe and they fall onto the bed. It is
a tender, romantic moment...

Until, (OS), a CAR ALARM goes off. Miranda bolts up.

				MIRANDA
		I hate this fucking town...

Carson ignores the ALARM -- and Miranda's comment. He pushes
her back onto the bed and turns off the bedside lamp.

All of the books and magazines about other places to live
spill from his nightstand, onto the floor...

							FADE OUT.
Rush Hour 2

 


















					RUSH HOUR 2

					BY

					Jeff Nathanson

































	EXT. HONG KONG SKYLINE - ESTABLISHING

	A smoky haze dims the blazing sun.  Skyscrapers sit like
	watchtowers over the city, where East meets West for five and
	a half million people a day.

	EXT. AMERICAN CONSULATE - HONG KONG - DAY

	THE AMERICAN EMBASSY - U.S. and Chinese flags side by side. 

	HU LI, dark glasses, EXITS and slowly moves toward a STREET
	VENDOR across the street.

	She pays for an order of pork bao; as she takes her first
	bite we see:

	THE EXPLOSION BEHIND HER

	TWO OFFICES ON THE SIXTH FLOOR BLOWN OUT - a huge fireball
	erupting over one side of the embassy.

	People panic and run.  Hu Li doesn't even flinch.  She takes
	a bite of her pork bao as she casually turns to the stunned
	street vendor.

				HU LI
			(Chinese, subtitled)
		Someone better call the police.

	EXT./INT. LEE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

	The passenger window rolls down and we see Carter, styling in
	a Chinese-cut suit.  He's holding a Chinese-English
	dictionary, leaning out the window - giving his best "do me"
	look to two girls in a convertible.

				CARTER
			(int Chinese)
		Deng wa lu yun cai-shen wu.

	The HORRIFIED GIRLS speed off, and Carter turns to Lee, who
	is driving and singing to his radio.

				LEE
			(singing)
		...wish they all could be California...
		wish they all could be California
		girls...

	Carter ejects the BEACH BOYS CD from the stereo and TOSSES it
	out of the SUNROOF.

				CARTER
		I warned you about playing that shit
		when I'm in the car.

				LEE
		That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a
		Chinese man's CD.

				CARTER
		Did you see the way those girls drove
		off?  I did you a favor.

				LEE
		Those girls drove off because of you.

				CARTER
		All I did was invite them for a drink.

				LEE
		You invited them to get naked and
		sacrifice a small goat.

				CARTER
			(checking Chinese-English
			 dictionary)
		I said that?  Which word was "goat?"

	Lee picks up his CD case.

				LEE
		You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys
		Greatest Hits, Volume Two.

				CARTER
		Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've
		been here three days and we haven't done
		shit.  We haven't been to a club,
		haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on
		vacation, and I want some mu-shu.

				LEE
		Mu-shu?  You're hungry?

				CARTER
		Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some
		women.  Now stop playing dumb and show
		me the shu!

	Carter flips through the dictionary.  A CALL COMES in over
	LEE'S CELL PHONE.

	INTERCUT

	INT. SUPERINDENDENT CHIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

	The following conversation is in Chinese, English subtitles.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		Lee, there was a bombing at the American
		Embassy.  Two American translators were
		killed.

				LEE
		Any leads?

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
			(beat)
		We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't
		want to take the case, I'll understand.

				LEE
		It's my responsibility.

	Lee hangs up the cell phone.

				CARTER
		What was that?  Did you just pick up a
		case?  Did we just take another damn
		case on my vacation?

	Lee smiles at Carter.

				LEE
		Of course not.  My Superindendent
		invited us to a club tonight.  Big
		party.

				CARTER
		Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will
		kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard
		you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.

				LEE
		Carter, would I lie to you?
						
			EXT. RAVEN CLUB - NIGHT

	Carter follows Lee out of the car, the two men making their
	way to the door of the Raven Club.  Carter is combing his
	hair, getting himself ready for a night on the town, stopping
	when he spots two hot WOMEN walking into the club.

				CARTER
		That's what I'm talking about.  A real
		Hong Kong night club.  You want an
		Altoid?

				LEE
		No.

				CARTER
		You better take one.  Your breath has
		been a little funky all day.  Let me
		look at you.

	Carter looks at Lee.  Fixes his collar.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Just relax and don't worry about a
		thing.  I'll hook you up in there.  You
		got condoms?

				LEE
		No.  

				CARTER
		Take this.  It's a Magnum.  You can fold
		it in half.

	Carter dances through the door, Lee follows.

	INT. RAVEN CLUB - NIGHT

	A dark, upscale club that is packed with GANGSTERS, BEAUTIFUL
	GIRLS and CIVILIANS.  Lee and Carter walk in.  Lee is trying
	to keep a low profile as Carter stares up at the stage, where
	a man sings Karaoke -- the most painful rendition of Michael
	Jackson's "DON'T STOP 'TILL YOU GET ENOUGH."

				LEE
		I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. 
		They don't like tourists in here, so try
		to blend in.

				CARTER
		Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than
		everyone here.  Where you going?

				LEE
		Bathroom.

	Lee walks off, trying not to be seen as Carter steps up to
	the bar, takes a seat next to TWO CHINESE THUGS.

				CARTER
		How you boys doing tonight?

	The thugs ignore Carter as he motions to the stage, where the
	OLD MAN continues to sing.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		That is the worst singing I've ever
		heard.  That sounds like something you'd
		hear in prison after lights out.

	The thugs continue to ignore Carter.

	INT. RAVEN CLUB - BACK HALL - NIGHT

	Lee makes his way down a hallway -- looks through an open
	door - sees a private room.  Several TRIADS are using hi-tech
	MACHINES to count stacks of AMERICAN HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS.

				CARTER (V.O.)
		Get closer to my body now.  And just
		love me, till you don't know how...

	Lee steps back into shadow -- does a double take as he
	realizes he's hearing Carter belting out "DON'T STOP 'TILL
	YOU GET ENOUGH."

	INT. RAVEN CLUB - CONTINUOUS

	A room full of Chinese sitting with their mouths open,
	watching Carter on the Karaoke stage doing a dead-on Michael
	Jackson, singing his heart out.  Dancing and making eyes at a
	few of the smitten women who are watching him.

				LEE
			(whispering from side of stage)
		Carter, get off that stage!

				CARTER
		Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a
		star, Lee.  A god to these people!

	Carter resumes singing, really getting down.  Moonwalking to
	the EDGE of the STATE where Lee PULLS HIM OFF.

				LEE
		This is a gangster bar, we're here
		undercover.

				CARTER
		I knew you were lying.

				LEE
		I'm sorry.

				CARTER
		Damn it, why are you ruining my night? 
		I'm just starting to have fun.
			(beat)
		Well fine then, go ahead, pull your
		badge and do your thing.

				LEE
		No, we're here for information, to find
		out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We
		must tread softly and keep our ears
		open.

				CARTER
		Tread softly?  Who taught you how to
		roost a bar?

				LEE
		Carter, you don't understand.  These men
		are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the
		most deadly gang in China.

				CARTER
		Man, are you crazy?  You think that
		scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented
		gangs.  We were having gang wars before
		anybody even thought about it.  We get
		royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme
		your badge and gun and I'll show you how
		it's done.

				LEE
		No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am
		Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.

				CARTER
		You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner
		last night.

	Before Lee can react, Carter has lifted Lee's badge and gun. 
	Carter bounds back on stage, pulls the plug on the music and
	fires three SHOTS into the ceiling, silencing the bar.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
			(Chinese)
		Deng wa lu yun, shen wu wattu masu wang
		lui.

	Nobody moves.  Strange looks from the crowd.  Carter turns to
	Lee.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
			(whispering)
		What'd I say?

				LEE
		You just said you're their worst
		nightmare - and to line their mothers up
		for a milking.

				CARTER
		Shit.  C'mon, get up here and help me
		out.

	Reluctantly, Lee gets on stage.  More looks from the Chinese
	as Carter speaks, Lee translating.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Okay, all the Triads and ugly women go
		to that side, all fine ass women on this
		side.

	Nobody moves.  Carter fires two more shots in the ceiling.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Let's try this again.  Who here knows
		Ricky Tan, raise your hand.

	Nobody moves.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Who here is named Lee?  Raise your hand.

	Nobody moves.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Now I know you're lying.  

	The crowd still hasn't moved.  Except in the back, where Lee
	spots several GANGSTERS leaving.  As Lee runs off stage --

				CARTER (CONT'D)
			(as they run out)
		I come back and catch y'all singing
		Michael Jackson and you're all going to
		jail.

	EXT. RAVEN CLUB - NIGHT

	Lee and Carter run into the street, just in time to see HU LI
	and several gangsters round a corner.

				CARTER
		Stop!  LAPD!

	Lee takes off and chases them on foot.

	EXT. HONG KONG STREET - NIGHT

	EXT. HONG KONG STREET - NIGHT

	The far end of the street is BLOCKED BY MARKET STALLS.  The
	GANGSTERS look around frantically.  An apartment building is
	under CONSTRUCTION, massive BAMBOO SCAFFOLDING top to bottom. 
	Their only way out is UP.

	Lee and Carter dash around the corner to see the gangsters
	SWARMING UP THE SCAFFOLDING.  Lee wastes no time going after
	them.  With a running start, he JAMS A FOOT on the wall and
	VAULTS to the BOTTOM RUNG, GRABS HOLD AND SWINGS UP.

				CARTER
		Hang on, Lee.  I'm coming.

	Carter jumps to grab hold of the scaffolding.  NOT EVEN
	CLOSE.  He backs up -- he's gonna take a running start!

	ABOVE - LEE REACHES 4 GANGSTERS.  They all tear off the
	LENGTHS OF BAMBOO and square off.  The clatter of wood
	against wood as they beat at each other.  Wrestling over his
	pole, Lee FLINGS TWO of the GANGSTERS over the edge.

	BELOW, Carter has hold of the bottom rung, STRAINING MIGHTILY
	to pull himself up.  Just as he gets his chin above the
	bar... snap!  It BREAKS and he drops.  Then...

	WHAM!  WHAM!  The two gangsters CRASH LAND ON EITHER side of
	CARTER.  HE takes one look at their pain.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Forget this...

	He dashes into the stairwell.  ABOVE, the last two GANGSTERS
	come at Lee.  He stomps down, levering up floor boards, which
	SEE-SAWS them off-balance.  With the advantage, he BATTERS
	them with his bamboo pole and knocks them off.  He climbs
	after the GANGSTER LEADER.

	ON HU LI and the GANGSTERS

	Coming over the crest of the hill, seeing Carter climbing up
	the hill.

	EXT. ROOF - CONTINUOUS

	Lee pulls himself up onto the roof, takes a few steps when
	WHAM!  He is clocked by a 16-foot BAMBOO POLE.  Lee TOPPLES
	OVER THE EDGE!  We see his adversary for the first time.

	HU LI - AGILE, GORGEOUS...DANGEROUS

	As she steps to the edge... BOOM!  The STAIRWELL DOOR FLIES
	OPEN and CARTER EMERGES.  Gun low and ready.  Hu Li is gone.

				CARTER
			(out of breath)
		Freeze!  Nobody move!

	Carter goes to the edge and sees Lee hanging on a pole below. 
	Carter is blind-sided by Hu Li.

	She takes one sultry step towards him, then twists her heel
	and WINDMILLS a HARD KICK that sends Carter FLYING OFF THE
	ROOF!

	He falls along the side of the building.  He manages to grab
	the end of a BAMBOO POLE that juts out from the scaffolding.

	LEE IS RIGHT THERE NEXT TO HIM!

	They're hanging side-by-side, holding on for their lives.  Hu
	Li looks down at them.  She has no weapon to finish them off. 
	She turns and runs, disappearing in the night.

	CARTER AND LEE

	holding on with all their strength.  The bamboo is starting
	to bend.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		All I wanted was a little mu-shu.

				LEE
		Try to land on your feet.

	Carter looks down at a rancid dumpster below them.

				CARTER
		I can't believe I flew ten-thousand
		miles for this shit.

	The POLE BREAKS
			
	SUPER THE TITLE:

	RUSH HOUR 2: REMEMBER THE DRAGON

	INT. LEE'S UNMARKED POLICE CAR - LATER THAT NIGHT

	Carter and Lee drive through Hong Kong, the two men riding in
	silence, bruised and covered in garbage.

				CARTER
		You lied to me. 

				LEE
		I'm sorry.

				CARTER
		You're sorry.  I got somebody's old
		chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't
		tell me you're sorry.  Just take me
		home.

				LEE
		No time.  There was an explosion at the
		American Embassy today -- two American
		translators were killed.

	Carter takes this in.  Can't believe his own bad luck.

				CARTER
		So that Ricky Tan, he's the one who blew
		up the Embassy?

	EXT. MONASTERY SCHOOL - EARLY MORNING

	Lee and Carter walk into a massive COURTYARD, where thirty 12
	year olds are going through their warm up routines.  

	MASTER FU, 60's, wears a BLACK ROBE as he teaches his kids.

				CARTER
		I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of
		this shit.  There's two billion Chinese -
		let one of them be your partner.

				LEE
		This won't take long. 

	Master Fu barks out a barrage of SHAOLIN FIGHTING STANCES.

				MASTER FU
		Dragon kick!

	Like well-trained army, the students YELL AND KICK HARD.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D)
		Lotus block!

	The students YELL and form an "X" with their arms.  Master Fu
	notices Carter and Lee watching from the back.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D)
		Twisting Tiger!

	No response.  The students exchange baffled looks.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D (CONT'D)
			(staring straight at Lee)
		Twisting Tiger!

	Lee may be a big rusty, but he puts on a shit-kicking move
	that leaves the students blown away.  Lee smiles, basking in
	the glow...

	...until he sees Master Fu's disappointment.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D)
		Didn't I teach you to always arch your
		back?

				LEE
			(bowing, humbled)
		Yes, Master.

	While Lee follows Master Fu, Carter stands in front of the 12
	YEAR OLDS, who sit motionless around a fighting circle. 

	Carter starts stretching his legs, warming up.

				CARTER
		I was watching you kids.  My name is
		Carter, LAPD, and I'm a third degree
		black belt.  At least that's what I tell
		the girls at the Holiday Health Spa
		where I work out.

	Carter throws a series of QUICK PUNCHES, but the kids have no
	reaction.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Let me give you kids some tips.  The key
		to Kung Fu is the follow through.  Why
		don't you stand up.

	THE KIDS DON'T MOVE, no reaction.  Carter continues to throw
	punches.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Go ahead, kick me, hit me.  I'll show
		you how to block.  Come on, stand up,
		give me your best shot -- try to kick
		right to my head.

	The kids still don't move.  Carter, working up a sweat from
	shadow fighting, takes off his JACKET, DRAPING IT over the
	HOLY BUDDHA behind him -- a mistake.  He swings back around
	to face the kids and NEVER SEES THE KICK that sends him
	flying back onto the mat.  He looks around and sees ALL of
	the kids STANDING, in FIGHTING POSITION.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		That's pretty good.  Which one of you
		kids did that?

	INT. COURTYARD PATHWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Master Fu walking.

				LEE
		I need your help, Master.  I'm seeking a
		man who used to train with you.  He's
		become a killer - the worst kind of
		animal.

				MASTER FU
		Animals kill only from hunger or fear. 
		The man you seek is lower than a
		serpent.  
			(faces Lee)
		...he kills for money.

	In the b.g., we see the kids leaping acrobatically over
	Carter from all sides.  Carter, frustrated, tries to grab the
	kids out of the air as they fly by, but they elude him.  They
	disappear O.S.

	Lee and Master Fu walk another moment, Master Fu lost in
	thought.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D)
		He was the best I ever trained, you
		know.

				LEE
		Ricky Tan?

				MASTER FU
		No.  Your father.
			(Lee reacts)
		Your father and Ricky Tan were my
		favorite students... and for such awful
		things to happen as they did --

	Lee cuts off Master Fu's reminisces -- he's obviously
	uncomfortable.

				LEE
		How do I find Ricky Tan?

	AGAIN IN THE B.G., Carter and the flying kids go zipping by
	in the other direction, disappear O.S.

	Master Fu pats the SOIL around a struggling plant.

				MASTER FU
		A seeding spends its entire life
		reaching towards Heaven.

				LEE
		I know, Master, but...

				MASTER FU
		The answers you seek can be found in
		Heaven on Earth.

				LEE
		Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't
		understand.
			(working it)
		A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A
		mountain, where Earth reaches for the --

				MASTER FU
		It's a massage parlor downtown.  "Heaven
		on Earth."  You will find your answers
		there.

	Lee bows to Master Fu, slowly turns to walk back down the
	pathway.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D)
		Wait!  Put a c-note in the jar.

	Lee puts a few bills in the jar, heads down a pathway. 
	Master Fu walks over and takes the cash.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D)
		Cheap bastard...

	EXT. MONASTERY SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

	Lee emerges from the path, stops when he sees Carter -- two
	students headlocked under each arm, another two scissor
	locked between his legs, holding another two down with his
	hands, and sitting on the last one.

				CARTER
		And that's how you use the LAPD choke
		hold.  Now start practicing and don't
		make me come back here!

				LEE
		Carter...you ready to have some fun!?

	EXT. HEAVEN ON EARTH MASSAGE PARLOR - DAY

	A neon light hangs above the upscale massage parlor.

				LEE
		Just follow my lead and act like a
		tourist.

				CARTER
		I am a tourist.

	INT. HEAVEN ON EARTH MASSAGE PARLOR - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter walk into an upscale MASSAGE PARLOR and stand
	in a lobby.  SOFT MUSIC is playing. 

				HOSTESS
		Good afternoon, gentlemen.

	Lee bows, followed by Carter.

				LEE
			(in Chinese)
		Hello.

				CARTER
		How you doin'?

				LEE
		My friend is on vacation, from America. 
		I want to show him a good time.

				HOSTESS
		Oh, you American?

				CARTER
		That's right.

				HOSTESS
		You bring American money?

				CARTER
			(holding up a Platinum AmEx)
		Never leave home without it.
			(to Lee)
		Lee, this one's on me.  You save your
		money.

	The Hostess takes Carter by the arm, walks over to a HIDDEN
	SLIDING DOOR - slides it open to reveal TWENTY BEAUTIFUL
	WOMEN.  Carter truly is in Heaven.

				HOSTESS
		You get massage from Chinese girl
		before?

				CARTER
		No.  It's my first time.

				HOSTESS
		You pick any girl for you and your
		friend.

	Carter looks like a kid in a candy store.

				CARTER
		Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that
		one.

				HOSTESS
		Oh yes, she's very nice.

				CARTER
		She is nice.  But I am very tense.  I'm
		gonna need a lot of massages.  I'll take
		that one, too.  How you doin', baby? 
		And...that one in pink.  She can do my
		feet.

	Lee elbows Carter.

				LEE
		What are you doing?

				CARTER
		She said I could pick any girl I want.

				LEE
		Well, hurry up.

				CARTER
		Hey!  You don't break in front of a
		black man in a buffet line.

				HOSTESS
			(to Lee)
		Your friend have big appetite.
			(handing ROBES to Lee and
			 Carter)
		Please put these on and wait upstairs in
		the quiet room.

	INT. QUIET ROOM MASSAGE PARLOR - DAY

	TWENTY MEN in SILK ROBES lie in reclining chairs, women
	massaging their feet and hands.  There are BIG SCREEN TV's
	showing nature films, relaxation music playing in the
	background. 

	Lee and Carter sit in the quiet room dressed in MATCHING
	PURPLE ROBES.  Lee wears SLIPPERS, Carter wears his HIGH
	TOPS.  Carter is enjoying a hand and neck massage at the same
	time.  A WOMAN walks over and hands them each a drink.

				CARTER
		Now I'm on vacation.  I knew you'd come
		through, Lee.

	LEE doesn't respond.  LEE IS STARING AT SOMEONE ON THE FAR
	SIDE OF THE ROOM.  A man who radiates a unique blend of
	sophistication and brutality.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		What's wrong?

				LEE
		Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.

				CARTER
		That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. 
		I'll go over with you right now, shake
		him down.

				LEE
		This is a very dangerous man.

				CARTER
		I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna
		ruin my massage because of some midget
		in a house coat.

				LEE
		I'm calling for back up!

	Lee gets up from a chair, hurriedly exits.

	Carter looks at RICKY TAN -- sitting quietly in his chair
	with his LAPTOP COMPUTER on his knees.  Carter makes a
	decision, gets up and walks towards him.

				CARTER
		Ricky Tan, I've been looking all over
		for you.  Get up.

	Tan looks up for a moment, a smile.

				RICKY TAN
		I'm busy at the moment.

				CARTER
		I said get on your feet!

				RICKY TAN
		I know you, Detective Carter, right? 
		You're Lee's American friend.  Enjoying
		your visit?

				CARTER
		I'm Lee's new muscle, his right arm --
		and don't let the robe fool you.  This
		is the only color they had left.  Now
		get up!

	Tan laughs, goes back to his laptop.  CARTER GRABS THE LAPTOP
	from Ricky and throws it across the room - SHATTERING IT
	against the wall.  Ricky glances at his men who are seated
	around the room waiting to move.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		I told you to get on your feet!

	Having heard the commotion, Lee arrives by Carter's side,
	breathless, as Tan looks up, surprised.

				RICKY TAN
		Lee, I've missed you, brother.
			(getting up, giving Lee a hug)
		I heard about the two Americans, I'm so
		sorry, you must be under great pressure.

				LEE
		You must come with me for questioning.

				CARTER
		Let's go.  I've got girls and chicken
		and hot oil waiting for me.

				RICKY TAN
		I don't think so...

	A nod of Ricky Tan's head, and TEN LARGE MEN in robes and
	towels spring out of reclining chairs -- menacingly facing
	Lee and Carter.  A beat...

				CARTER
		I'd like to pay you for that laptop.

				RICKY TAN
		It's no problem.  But I must excuse
		myself, inspector.

				CARTER
		That's Chief Inspector, he got promoted.

	Tan bows to Lee and Carter.

				RICKY TAN
		Congratulations.  And good day.

	As Tan starts to exit, Lee and Carter move to intercept him. 
	But they are blocked by TAN'S MEN.

	Lee grabs one of the men's towels and pulls it off.  The man
	covers his naked body.  Lee is grabbed by one of the other
	henchmen, but he escapes and begins kicking ass, using the
	towel and his own robe to block and wrap another man's arms --
	blocking, kicking, and punching everything in sight -- all
	the while managing to keep his privates covered with a towel,
	his robe, or some other found object.

	Carter, meanwhile, uses his quick hands to send several men
	flying back -- grabbing a towel of one of them.

				CARTER
			(ref: his privates)
		Damn!  No wonder you're pissed off.

	Carter uses the towel like Lee did to block and trap one of
	the men's punches.

	In the middle of fighting, Lee is suddenly exposed -- he
	flinches to cover himself and is punched from behind. 
	Momentarily stunned, he's lifted from behind -- two men
	throwing him out the front door.

	Carter is also overpowered by two men, who lift him over
	their shoulders.

	EXT. HONG KONG HIGHWAY - DAY

	Ricky Tan's black limo SCREECHES to a stop.  The door flies
	open and Lee and Carter are TOSSED out onto the highway. 
	Both men are completely naked.

	EXT. HONG KONG POLICE STATION - DAY

	A packed street - Lee and Carter dodging in and out of
	people.  The CAMERA PANS and we see Lee and Carter from
	behind.

				CARTER
		Goddamn you got a small ass.

				LEE
		Don't look at my ass!

	INT. HONG KONG POLICE STATION - BULLPEN - DAY

	PANDEMONIUM

	The station is packed with Americans -- FBI AGENTS, SECRET
	SERVICE... they've set up shop right in the middle of the
	bullpen.

	SUPERINDENDENT CHIN is arguing with SPECIAL AGENT STERLING, a
	50-year old hard ass who is in charge of this circus.

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		Chin, you have been ordered by the
		Ministry of Public Security to assist
		the FBI and Secret Service with our
		investigation, to provide us with
		whatever we need.  If you have
		information, it belongs to us.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		This is still Hong Kong.

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		Two Americans have been killed on United
		States Government property -- this is
		our investigation.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		Chief Inspector Lee will brief your
		people...

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		No.  He will report to me.  Do we
		understand each other?

	SUDDENLY ALL EYES turn as Carter and Lee enter the bullpen. 
	Out of breath, still robed: Lee covering himself with a trash
	can lid, Carter using a red construction cone.

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING (CONT'D)
		Who the hell is that?

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
			(humiliated)
		That is...Chief Inspector Lee.  The
		detective in charge of our
		investigation.

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		Put a diaper on him, Chin.  I want to
		talk to the great Inspector Lee.

	INT. LEE'S OFFICE - DAY

	The shades are down as Lee frantically gets dressed, putting
	on a suit and fixing his tie. 
	Carter finishes putting on a BLACK CHINESE STYLE SUIT from
	Lee's closet, then moves for the door.

				LEE
		Where are you going?

				CARTER
		Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn
		passport back.  I'm going home.

				LEE
		Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.

				CARTER
		Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up,
		so I backed you up.  I was about to take
		out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.

				LEE
		Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit!

				CARTER
		My bullshit?  I'm not the one who goes
		to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! 
		I'm not the one who goes to massage
		parlors to bust crime lords!

				LEE
		It's my job!

				CARTER
		You're pathetic, man.  When's the last
		time you had some fun?  When's the last
		time you took a night off, had a date?

				LEE
		I have plenty of dates.

				CARTER
		Really?  When's the last time you had
		some Mu-shu  Let's hear it, Lee, when
		was it?  Year of the rat?

				LEE
		You would never understand my life. 
		You're not Chinese.

				CARTER
		And you ain't black!

	The two men look at each other for a long BEAT.  Lee quickly
	walks out, slamming the door behind him, leaving Carter half
	dressed.

	INT. SUPERINDENDENT CHIN'S OFFICE - DAY

	Lee walks in, sees Sterling sitting at Chin's desk.  Chin
	stands in the back.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from
		the United States Secret Service.

				LEE
		The Secret Service?  Why?

				STERLING
		What I'm about to tell you cannot leave
		this room.  The men who were killed
		yesterday were not American translators. 
		They were undercover U.S. customs agents
		trying to break a Triad smuggling ring. 
		We don't know what they're transporting
		out of Hong Kong, but whatever it is, it
		got the agents killed.

				LEE
		How can we help?

				STERLING
		Stay the hell out of our way.

				LEE
		I can get to Ricky Tan.

				STERLING
		We know all about Tan.  That's why we're
		leaving him out there as bait.  We think
		this is a lot bigger than just Ricky Tan
		and his Fu-Cang-Long Triads.

	INT. LEE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

	Carter is on the phone, his feet on Lee's desk.  As he talks
	he opens a drawer, pulls out a wad of cash and pockets it.

				CARTER
		Captain, you're gonna have to speak up. 
		I'm on a car phone!

	INT. CAPTAIN DIEL'S OFFICE - LAPD HEADQUARTERS - DAY

	CAPTAIN DIEL sits behind his desk talking on the phone.

				CAPTAIN DIEL
		Is it true, Carter?  Are you in Hong
		Kong right now?

				CARTER
		Hong Kong?  I'm not in Hong Kong.  I'm
		in Hollywood -- right at Sunset and
		Vine, two minutes from the station.  How
		about I pick you up right now and take
		you to dinner?

				CAPTAIN DIEL
		It's nine-thirty in the morning.

				CARTER
		Did I say dinner?  I meant diner. 
		Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.

				CAPTAIN DIEL
		Do you know what happened yesterday,
		Carter?  I was officially nominated for
		the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. 
		There was a dinner last night, two
		hundred LAPD officers were there.

				CARTER
		Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez
		there?  He owes me money.

				CAPTAIN DIEL
		I've waited my whole life for this job,
		but I don't have a shot in hell of
		getting it.  Do you know why?

				CARTER
		Is it because of the hookers, sir?  You
		tell them there's no crime in being
		lonely.

				CAPTAIN DIEL
		No, Carter.  The reason I'm screwed is
		because the entire department is about
		to find out the stolen credit cards we
		impounded were used to buy two first
		class upgrades to Hong Kong.  And what
		the hell is Heaven on Earth?

				CARTER
		Sir, I'm working on a big case over here
		-- and by the time I get back they're
		gonna make you Governor.  Captain, you
		there?  Hello?  Shit!

	As Carter walks out the DOOR, he brushes past HU LI, who is
	standing in the hallway disguised as a FED EX DELIVERY
	PERSON.  Carter checks her out as he exits.

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	CARTER starts walking down the street, making his way past an
	outdoor BUTCHER MARKET, getting strange looks from locals and
	tourists alike.  He motions to an OLD WOMAN who is selling
	LIVE DUCKS, PIGEONS AND CHICKENS

				CARTER
		How you doing?  Can you direct me to the
		Heaven on Earth massage parlor?  

	The OLD WOMAN stares at Carter, starts motioning to her CAGES
	filled with birds.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		No, I don't eat live birds.  I like my
		birds dead and deep fried.  You ever
		been to Popeyes?

	The Woman takes out a bird, holds up a HATCHET.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		No, don't do that, I had a big lunch. 
		I'm warning you, I'm a police officer --
		just put the blade down and let the bird
		go.

	INT. HONG KONG POLICE STATION - BULLPEN/LEE'S OFFICE - DAY

	Lee walks out of the Captain's office, heads for his own
	office - but never gets there.

	AN EXPLOSION rips through the second floor of the station. 
	Lee diving for safety as glass and debris shoot over his
	head.  Sheer pandemonium as Lee quickly looks up at his
	destroyed office, tries to get to his feet.

	STUNNED POLICE OFFICERS and DETECTIVES are crowded around
	Lee's office, looking at the rubble.  Lee pushes through the
	crowd -- it's all smoke and fire.  Now way anyone held back
	by the heat.

				LEE
		Carter!  CARTER!

	EXT. HONG KONG STREET - DAY

	Carter walks down the street holding a CAGE WITH A LIVE RED
	BIRD inside.  He stops a MAN who is sweeping in front of his
	store.

				CARTER
		How you doing?  I'm looking for Heaven
		on Earth.

	The man stares at Carter, watches as he pulls out his:

	ENGLISH/CHINESE DICTIONARY

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Shan-shui cao guo-jiu, pao gai niu tao
		zi.

				MAN
		You wish to spank my sister with a ping
		pong paddle?

				CARTER
		No man, I was just asking...

				MAN
		Wait here.  I'll go see if she's awake.

	As the man walks into his store, Carter runs off.

	Pause.

	Carter strolls back INTO FRAME, peering into the store to see
	if it's worth staying...

	INT. HONG KONG POLICE STATION - BULL PEN - DAY

	Lee sits by himself in shock.  Superindendent Chin
	approaches.

				LEE
		All he wanted was some mu-shu.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		Are you okay, Lee?

	Beat.

				LEE
		I'm sorry, I have to go.

	EXT. HEAVEN ON EARTH MASSAGE PARLOR - AFTERNOON

	Carter finally makes his way to the massage parlor, moving
	for the FRONT DOOR when he sees RICKY TAN EXIT.  Carter ducks
	to the side and watches as Ricky climbs into the back of a
	waiting Daimler.

	The Daimler drives off.  Carter rushes to the middle of the
	street with a determined look on his face.

				CARTER
		I'm gonna solve this case myself.  Taxi!

	Carter flags down a CAB, jumps in the back seat.

	INT. TAXI - EVENING

	The CAB DRIVER turns to Carter, who motions to the limo.

				CARTER
			(loud)
		Follow that limo.

	The Cab Driver continues to stare at Carter.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		You understand what I'm saying?  Follow
		that car!  Where it goes, you go!  This
		is a chase -- we are chasing that limo!
			(beat)
		We are still parked -- we're not moving! 
		This is the opposite of chasing -- drive
		the car or I will kill you!

	The driver slowly turns, holding out his hand.  Carter fishes
	in his pocket hands the cab driver a wad of cash.

				CAB DRIVER
		Now you speak my language.
			
	INT. LEE'S CAR - DAY

	Lee drives, misty-eyed.  RAP MUSIC playing over the stereo. 
	Lee turns it up, slowly moving his head to the music, in
	tribute to Carter.

	His CELL PHONE rings, he turns down the music.

	INTERCUT -- 

	INT. CHIN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		Lee, we just got a call from the harbor
		patrol.  Ricky Tan is throwing a little
		party on his boat tonight.  Victoria
		harbor.  If you don't want to...

				LEE
		Did you tell Sterling?

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		Let him find out on his own.  I want the
		Hong Kong police handling this.

				LEE
		Thank you.

	Lee hangs up.  A look of intensity.  He CRANKS the RAP MUSIC
	up, a man on a mission.

	EXT. YACHT - HARBOR - NIGHT

	A 190-FOOT YACHT is anchored in Victoria Harbor.  Ricky Tan
	walks along the top deck with HU LI, disappearing into a
	crowd of people who are partying on the ship.

	Carter steps out of the cab.

				CARTER
		Stay here.  I'll be right back.  You
		understand?

				CAB DRIVER
		Yes.  I understand.

	Carter steps out of the cab, which immediately drives off,
	leaving him alone on the docks.

	Carter looks around the dock -- a pull up valet station
	parking fancy cars, RICH PEOPLE getting on the boat as their
	names are checked off a list by two DOORMEN.

	INT. YACHT - NIGHT

	A huge PARTY, a live band plays for a crowd of business men,
	politicians and beautiful women - a who's who of Hong Kong.

	CARTER walks up to the front of the boat -- TWO DOORMEN
	HOLDING clipboards immediately stop him.

				DOORMAN #1
		Invitation, please.

				CARTER
		I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.

				DOORMAN #1
		The band has been playing over an hour.

				CARTER
		I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo. 
		Ricky here yet, I need to get his
		requests.

	As Carter walks past the doorman -- 

				DOORMAN #1
		Wait.

				CARTER
		Last party all he wanted was Sting --
		not one person danced.  Tonight I'm
		doing Superfreak, I don't care what he
		says.  Where is he?

				DOORMAN #1
		Mr. Tan is not to be disturbed by the
		help.

	Carter turns back to the doorman, grabs him by the collar.

				CARTER
		Help?  I'm not the help, man -- I'm the
		star.  That's my band up there -- I
		control the mood, the groove, the
		atmosphere.

	Carter cuts a smoking DANCE MOVE.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Can you do that?
			(man shakes head "no")
		That's why you're down here and I'm up
		there.  Now this is my party -- don't
		forget it!

	Carter walks onto the ship, starts singing to himself.

	EXT. YACHT - HARBOR - CONTINUOUS

	The SHIP'S HORN SOUNDS, the yacht starts to head out to sea. 
	Lee steps out of his car, sees the yacht is pulling out of
	the slip.  He runs along the side of the boat, has no choice
	but to jump from the end of the pier, landing hard on the
	side of the ship, somehow holding onto a PORTHOLE WINDOW.  He
	clings to the yacht, then throws himself toward a hanging
	LIFEBOAT, climbs up the side and jumps toward the TOP RAIL --

	EXT. YACHT - CONTINUOUS

	As Carter walks through the ship, he grabs a handful of food
	from a waiter, his eyes searching the crowd, rounds a corner 
	- almost stepping right into HU LI, who's approaching STEVEN
	REIGN.  Steven Reign is in his 50's -- perfectly groomed,
	impeccably dressed - his looks and bearing say one thing --
	money. 
	He's got the big party smile on, but as Hu Li arrives,
	Reign's face shifts and his eyes go dead -- the billionaire
	as sociopath.

	Carter steps back, but sees Reign Whisper to Hu Li.  Carter
	hides and turns away as Hu Li instinctively scans the room
	for signs of trouble.  He heads into the main party.

	Carter stops walking when he comes upon ISABELLA MOLINA, a
	stunning brunette, sitting at the bar drinking a glass of
	champagne.  Carter lights her cigarette for her.

				CARTER
		How you doing, baby?  My name is Prince
		Mubutu from Nigeria.

				ISABELLA
		Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That
		seat is taken.

				CARTER
			(in mangled Spanish)
		San Juan!  You must know my good friend
		Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector
		Elizondo.

				ISABELLA
			(in English)
		I don't think so.

				CARTER
		I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled
		in the best circles.  But hey, I
		understand.  Make yourself at home,
		Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever
		you want.  My ship is your ship.

				ISABELLA
		This is your ship?

				CARTER
		That's right.  I'm the owner, the
		Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.

				ISABELLA
		El Capitan?

				CARTER
		I don't want to play games with you,
		Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself
		with you -- in one of those bathrooms
		over there in about five minutes.

				ISABELLA
		Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a
		beautiful yacht.  What's it called?

				CARTER
		Called?  What's my ship called?
			(he has no idea)
		Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow
		Johnson.

				ISABELLA
		The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name
		on the back was "Red Dragon."

				CARTER
		Red Dragon?  You sure about that?

				ISABELLA
		I'm sure, because this is my friend's
		yacht.  And it's his party.

				CARTER
		Your friend's ship?
			(looking around)
		Oh, man.  I must've walked onto the
		wrong yacht.  I knew there was a reason
		my keys didn't work.

				STEVEN REIGN
			(taking seat next to Isabella)
		Who's your friend?

				ISABELLA
		Somebody who got on the wrong yacht.

				CARTER
		Wait a second.  You're Steven Reign? 
		You're big time.  You own all them big
		hotels.  What are you doing in Hong
		Kong?

				STEVEN REIGN
			(ushering away Isabella)
		I'm just in town for the weekend, taking
		in the sights.

				ISABELLA
		Enjoy the party, Mr. Carter.

	Carter nods, waves.  Steven Reign and Isabella walk away. 
	Carter's watching.

	INT. SHIP'S HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Lee makes his way toward a STAIRCASE that is blocked by a
	BODYGUARD.  He quickly disarms the guard and grabs him by the
	throat, pushing him against the wall.

				LEE
		Ricky Tan.  Where is he?

				BODYGUARD #1
		Who's asking?

				LEE
		The Hong Kong Police.  He killed a
		detective today and he's not getting
		away with it.  Now where is he?

				CARTER
		Yeah.  Tell us!  And don't play games or
		we'll kick your lying ass!

	Lee slowly turns around and looks at Carter, who is standing
	right behind him.

				LEE
		Carter?

				CARTER
		Who died?

				LEE
		You.

				CARTER
		Detective Yu?  Never met him.

				LEE
		Not Yu.  You!

				CARTER
		Who?

				LEE
		Do you understand the words that are
		coming out of my mouth?

				CARTER
		Nobody understands the words that are
		coming out of your mouth.

				BODYGUARD #1
		Get your hands in the air.

	Lee and Carter turn to see FOUR BODYGUARDS standing in front
	of them with GUNS in hand.

				BODYGUARD #1 (CONT'D)
		Ricky Tan is expecting you.
			
			INT. RICKY TAN'S YACHT - MAIN CABIN - NIGHT

	It looks like HUGH HEFNER'S BEDROOM complete with ROUND BED
	and SUNKEN BAR.  Ricky Tan sits in front of a big screen
	satellite TV screaming at the Lakers.  Hu Li opens the door
	and the bodyguards lead Lee into the bedroom.

				RICKY TAN
		Come on, Shaq, hit a damn free-throw! 
		You can do it, big guy.

	ON TV

	We see Shaq miss his free throw.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
		Shit!  He still doesn't follow through. 
		I just lost five grand.

	Tan turns off the TV, turns to Lee.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
		Why don't we go on the deck, get some
		air...and some privacy.
			(to Hu Li)
		Leave us alone.

	Hu Li hesitates, upset at being dismissed.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
			(to Lee)
		Could you have your partner wait for us
		outside?

				CARTER
		I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist.  I
		got proof.  See, I got a mini-bar key.

				LEE
			(to Carter)
		I'll meet you on the main deck in ten
		minutes.

	Carter pulls Lee aside.

				CARTER
		What, leave you alone so he can cap you?

				LEE
		I'm okay, you go.

				CARTER
		Why the hell should you believe him?  He
		had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty
		shit.

				LEE
		Remember I told you my father was a
		policeman?
			(beat)
		Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.

				CARTER
			(pause)
		What the hell is going on here?

	No answer.  Carter holds Lee's glance for a beat, then turns
	and walks the other way.

	EXT. RICKY TAN'S YACHT - UPPER DECK - NIGHT

	Tan and Lee reach the upper deck, where they are alone.

				RICKY TAN
		Despite what people suspect...what you
		suspect --

				LEE
		Don't.

	Ricky Tan hears the steel in Lee's voice, acknowledges it.

				RICKY TAN
		... if your father were alive, I would
		be turning to him now.
			(beat)
		I didn't blow up the American Embassy,
		but I believe some of my people did.  My
		enemies are trying to frame me.
			(beat)
		There is a war going on within the
		Triads -- and I am going to lose.  My
		name has been written into the book of
		death.

				LEE
		The police can protect you.

				RICKY TAN
		Nobody can protect me.  I'll make a deal
		with you, Lee.  But only iff you'll get
		me out of Hong Kong.

				LEE
		Tell me why they killed the customs
		agents.

				RICKY TAN
		There is a ship, in the Hong Kong
		Harbor...

	Hu Li BURSTS onto the deck, flanked by FOUR BODYGUARDS.

	Ricky Tan screams something at Hu Li in Chinese.  Hu Li
	screams back as SHE EMPTIES HER GUN INTO RICKY'S CHEST.  Tan
	falls back, over the rail, and into the water.

	Lee MOVES TOWARDS HU LI, but the four bodyguards are on Lee,
	attacking from all sides.  Hu Li exits as Lee tries to fight
	off the bodyguards.

	INT. RICKY TAN'S YACHT - MAIN CABIN - NIGHT

	Reactions from the crowd as GUNSHOTS echo from the deck
	above.

	INT. SHIP'S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Hu Li moves quickly down the hallway, rounding a corner and
	suddenly goes FLYING, landing flat on her face.

	It's Carter, who ran to the sound of the gunshot, and TRIPPED
	Hu Li with his leg.

				CARTER
		All right, get your hands up.

	Hu Li backflips up -- kicking Carter in the head.

	EXT. UPPER DECK - CONTINUOUS

	Lee takes down Bodyguard #1, but is still fighting three on
	one.  A furious exchange of acrobatic blows between Lee and
	Bodyguard #2.

	INT. SHIP'S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Carter and Hu Li face off.

				CARTER
		You wanna piece of me?  C'mon, I'll give
		you a little LAPD ass kickin'.

	Hu Li savages Carter with a series of punishing blows.

	INT. UPPER DECK - CONTINUOUS

	Lee manages to defeat Bodyguards #3 and #4.  As he catches
	his breath the sound of a SPEED BOAT starting its engines.

				LEE
		Hu Li!

	Lee runs to the rail -- looks down to see a SPEEDBOAT
	starting to pull away from the ship.  Hu Li jumps onboard the
	moving boat.

	Lee starts to turn for the stairs, running down towards the
	stern.
			
	EXT. YACHT - STERN - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter run up to the stern at the same time --
	watching helplessly as Hu Li gets away in the speed boat.

	Carter turns his head, sees --

	-- STEVEN REIGN at the other end of the boat, watching Hu Li
	escape, not at all behaving like a panicky billionaire should
	during a gangland shooting.  Wordlessly, Reign disappears
	back into the shadows.

	EXT. DOCK - NIGHT

	The yacht is anchored.  A few TRIADS led away in handcuffs. 
	Thrown into PATROL CARS that have surrounded the docks.

	Sterling, Chin, Lee and Carter on the dock.

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		Quite a night, Inspector.  Ricky Tan was
		our only bait, and now he's gone.  You
		finally got your revenge - at the
		expense of a U.S. Government
		investigation.

				CARTER
		What "revenge" is he talking about?

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid
		you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was
		a pure vendetta killing -- but you're
		off this case.  I don't ever want to see
		you again, you got that?

				CARTER
		Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are
		you --

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going
		back to L.A.

				CARTER
		Fine with me.

	Sterling walks away disgusted.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		I'm sorry Lee, but my orders are to
		fully cooperate with the Secret Service.

	Lee nods a respectful but bitter acknowledgment.  Chin
	motions for two uniformed Hong Kong police officers to
	approach.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN (CONT'D)
			(to police officers)
		Escort Detective Carter to the airport --

				LEE
		I'll take him.

				CARTER
		Hell no.

	The Hong Kong police officers produce HANDCUFFS.  Beat.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
			(to Lee)
		Fine.  But don't expect me to talk to
		you.

	Carter stalks off.

				LEE
		Don't push me, Carter.  I'm in no mood
		for your bullshit.

	Carter gets in Lee's face.  The two men look like they're
	about to come to blows.

				CARTER
		What are you gonna do about it,
		grasshopper?

				LEE
		I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.

				CARTER
		Give me your best shot, you flat assed
		mama's boy.

				LEE
		Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my
		ass!

				CARTER
		I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.

				LEE
		No.  She's a school teacher.

				CARTER
		You're not very good at this, are you?

				LEE
		Good at what?   

				CARTER
		Forget it.

	A long beat while Lee considers what to say.

				LEE
		Five years ago, my father was Chief
		Inspector working a big international
		smuggling case.

				CARTER
		Ask me if I give a shit.

	Lee waits a beat, then drops the bombshell.

				LEE
		Ricky Tan killed my father.

	Carter is suddenly all ears, listening intently now to Lee.

				LEE (CONT'D)
		He found out his partner, Tan, had been
		working for the Triads all along.
			(beat)
		Before my father could prove it, he was
		killed in the line of duty.

				CARTER
		How the hell did Tan get away with it?

				LEE
		All the evidence against him
		disappeared, the smuggling case was
		unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to
		the Triads openly.

				CARTER
			(pause)
		This is about your Daddy's death?  Hell,
		Lee, you know my father died on the job. 
		You could have told me...
			(realizing)
		This is about more than all that, isn't
		it?  This is about your Daddy's last
		case, right?

	Lee's caught, fibs badly.

				LEE
		No, no, that would be crazy --

				CARTER
		You thought the "Customs Agents get
		blown up" and "smuggling" and "Ricky
		Tan" and you put it all together and
		came up with a five year old case. 
		That's why you didn't tell me what we
		were doing...

				LEE
		I thought you'd think it was crazy.

				CARTER
		IT IS CRAZY!

				LEE
		I know.  I know.  I am sorry.

	Lee inclines his head, stiffly, turns and walks toward his
	car.  Carter watches him.  Finally he rolls his eyes and
	yells.

				CARTER
		So are you getting on the plane or not?!

				LEE
		What?

				CARTER
		Come on, we still got time to order the
		Kosher meal.  Always get the kosher
		meal, they bring it first.

				LEE
		I cannot go to LA...

	Carter steps close, and for a second we see the man and the
	cop beneath the attitude.

				CARTER
		It sounds impossible --

				LEE
		You said --

				CARTER
		-- but if somebody gave me the chance to
		square up my father's death, I'd go to
		hell to do it.

	Carter turns, walks away without looking back.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		You want to figure out why they killed
		your Daddy, get on the plane.

				LEE
		Why LA?

				CARTER
			(still not turning)
		I guess you're going to have to trust me
		on this one.
			
			INT. 747 PASSENGER COMPARTMENT

	Carter and Lee are getting comfortable among all the other
	passengers, preparing to take off.  Lee has a moment of
	doubt.

				LEE
		I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a
		boat in Hong Kong Harbor...

				CARTER
		Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter
		Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow
		the Rich White Man.

				LEE
		Follow the Rich White Man?

				CARTER
		Almost, but you've got to say "Rich
		White Man" all run together like it's
		one word.

				LEE
		Follow the RichWhiteMan...

				CARTER
		Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere,
		has a rich white man taking his cut. 
		Every single one.  Now in our case, we
		know the rich white man is Steven Reign.

				LEE
		Who?

				CARTER
		Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky
		Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just
		before Ricky got smoked.

				LEE
		How do you know he's our man?

				CARTER
		Because when the shooting started he was
		way too cool.  See most white people,
		when there's shooting, they either hide
		in a toilet or start screaming high
		pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!

				LEE
		You sound like that all the time.

				CARTER
		Black people keep their cool when the
		shit goes down.

				LEE
		Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never
		panic.

				CARTER
		Yeah, what about when Godzilla was
		coming?  You people were screaming your
		asses off.

				LEE
		Just tell me where I can find this
		Steven Reign.

				CARTER
		The same place you find all
		RichWhiteMen.
			(a tray arrives)
		Gefilte Fish.  Lox and bagel.  I love
		this stuff.  Here, try it with a smear.

	BINOCULARS P.O.V. THE REIGN TOWERS HOTEL

	CUT TO REVEAL --

	Carter standing at a window holding high-powered binoculars.

	Lee standing next to him.  WE ARE:

	INT. CHEAP HOTEL ROOM - DOWNTOWN LA - NIGHT

	Cartons of Chinese food are all over the sleazy, run down
	hotel room.  The LIGHTS LOW, the curtains open a crack.

	BINOCULARS P.O.V. - THE REIGN HOTEL

	Traveling up the side of the Reign Hotel.  Stopping at the
	penthouse floor - where we see ISABELLA talking with Steven
	Reign in a hotel room.  After a BEAT, Reign walks to the
	door.

	Carter flips the binoculars to Lee, who starts watching.

				CARTER
		Yeah, that's definitely the woman from
		Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in
		his suite at his hotel, I told you this
		would work out.  They still just
		talking?

				LEE
		He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.

				CARTER
		He'll be back soon.

				LEE
		How do you know?

				CARTER
		Look at her.  Now, wake me in an hour,
		I'll take over.

	Lee lowers the binoculars, turns to Carter, who is trying to
	sleep on the bed.

				LEE
		Carter, there's something I have to tell
		you.  You were right about what you said
		in Hong Kong.  All I do is work.  Never
		take a day off.  It's all I have right
		now.

				CARTER
		Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.

				LEE
		The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu
		in six months.

				CARTER
		You pull a muscle or something?

				LEE
		My fiancee left me over the summer -- a
		month before our wedding.

				CARTER
		I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?

				LEE
		It's a long story.

				CARTER
		Let me guess, she couldn't handle the
		cop thing -- never knowing if you were
		dead or alive.  I've seen it a million
		times.

				LEE
		No.  It was my singing.

				CARTER
		Excuse me?

				LEE
		She hated my voice.  Said it drove her
		crazy.  I sang to her all the time - in
		bed - in the shower - I thought she
		liked it.  She finally told me it was
		driving her crazy.

	Carter stares at Lee for a long BEAT.

				CARTER
		Lee, maybe it's best if we don't discuss
		our personal lives.  Let's die curious.

	LEE LIFTS THE BINOCULARS - turns back to the building.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		What's she doing?

	BINOCULARS P.O.V. - ON ISABELLA

	She walks to the bedroom, where we see her through SHEER
	CURTAINS.  Slowly taking off her coat.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Lee?  You okay?

	Lee's eyes go wide as Isabella drops her coat and starts to
	unbutton her blouse.

				LEE
		She's just standing around -- not doing
		much.

				CARTER
		Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later
		something's gonna happen.

				LEE
		I'll try to stay awake.  It's so boring.

	Isabella starts to remove her blouse.  Lee starting to sweat
	as he watches her undress.

				LEE (CONT'D)
		Slow down, baby.

				CARTER
		What did you say?

				LEE
		Nothing.  I said nothing.

	Lee lowers his binoculars, steps away from the window.

				LEE (CONT'D)
		Is it hot in here?

				CARTER
		Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.

				LEE
		I'm gonna go in the hall and get a
		bucket of ice.  You want some ice?

				CARTER
		What's going on?  

	Lee stares at Carter, looks dazed.

				LEE
		She's getting undressed.

				CARTER
		Gimme the binoculars.

				LEE
		No.  It's not right.

				CARTER
		Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot
		you.

	Lee hands Carter the binoculars, then turns his back as
	Carter watches to the window.

				LEE
		What's she doing?

				CARTER
		Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...

				LEE
		I don't want to hear this.

				CARTER
		Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra
		and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring
		Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec -
		there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it
		looks like Snoopy.

				LEE
		Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.

				CARTER
		She just took her hair down.  Now she's
		going for the bra -- the clasp is in
		front -- she's using both hands.
			(to Lee)
		You better get that ice.

	Lee steps in front of Carter, blocking his view.

				LEE
		That's enough.  We shouldn't be doing
		this!

	Isabella suddenly drops undressing and walks back to the
	living room to pick up the PHONE.  We see her clearly now in
	bra and panties.

				CARTER
		This is our job.  We took an oath as
		police officers.  If we don't do this,
		who will?  Firemen?

	Lee backs off, and Carter steps back to the window.  He sees
	Isabella hang up the phone.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Wait a sec - what the hell is that
		between her legs?

				LEE
		What?

				CARTER
		She's reaching into her panties --
		something is strapped to her leg.  Oh,
		God...please don't let it be a dick.

				LEE
		What is it?

				CARTER
		No, I don't believe this shit -- it's a
		microphone.  Lee, she's wired...

	CLOSE ON ISABELLA

	As she turns to the window.  A TAPE RECORDER in hand.  She
	puts the recording device away, walks back into the bedroom
	and puts on a robe.

				LEE
		I don't understand?

				CARTER
		She's walking back towards the door.

	BINOCULARS P.O.V.

	We see Isabella wearing a robe - standing at the door of her
	hotel room talking with someone.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		She opened the door.  Someone is
		delivering a package.

	BINOCULARS P.O.V.

	Inside the hotel room WE SEE HU LI handing her a package.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Lee...it's the girl who delivered the
		package to your office.  It's a bomb!

	Lee and Carter bolt on the move - sprinting out of the room.

	INT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - PENTHOUSE SUITE - NIGHT

	Isabella closes the door.  She BRINGS THE BOMB WITH HER as
	she walks into the bedroom --

	EXT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

	Carter and Lee run across the street, heading towards the
	entrance of the hotel.

	INT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter sprint out the Penthouse Elevators, running
	down the hallway.

	INT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - PENTHOUSE SUITE - CONTINUOUS

	Isabella takes her robe off, glances at the package, picks it
	up and starts to open it as Lee and Carter come BURSTING
	THROUGH the BEDROOM DOOR.

				LEE/CARTER
		NO!

	Carter and Lee stare at Isabella, who stands in bra and
	panties.

				CARTER
		Damn girl, you fine.

	Lee lowers his eyes as Isabella looks at him, grabbing the
	BOMB, Carter following him as they sprint out the bedroom.

	INT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter run out the suite - Lee throwing the BOMB
	toward the END OF THE HALL as he and Carter dive to the
	floor.

	Nothing happens.

	Lee looks up, SEES a HOTEL EMPLOYEE pushing a room service
	CART, about to walk right past the package --

				LEE
		GET DOWN!!

	Lee and Carter run back to the bomb.

				CARTER
		Pick it up!

				LEE
		It's your turn!

				CARTER
		I don't need a turn!

	Carter picks it up, starts running with it through the hall,
	heading for the elevator.

				LEE
		Throw it!

	Carter is about to throw it in, when HE SEES AN OLDER COUPLE
	STANDING INSIDE.

				HOTEL GUESTS
		Do you want us to hold the elevator?

				CARTER
		Get the hell away from here!

	Carter is still holding the bomb, doesn't know what to do
	with it --

				LEE
		Stairs!

	Carter throws him the bomb, and Lee runs to the stairs --

	INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

	Lee is about to throw the bomb down the stairwell -- when he
	sees TWO MAIDS WALKING toward him.

				CARTER
		Get out of the building!

	Lee looks horrified as he hangs onto the package, has no
	choice but to throw it back to Carter.

				LEE
		Roof!

	EXT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - ROOF - NIGHT

	Lee and Carter burst through the roof door - Carter trying to
	hold the bomb as far away from himself as possible. 
	He looks over the side for a place to dump it - the streets
	are filled with PEOPLE AND CARS.

				LEE
		Wait!  There's people down there!

				CARTER
		There's people up here!

				LEE
		Get it out of here!

				CARTER
		Take it!

	Lee takes the bomb, quickly ROLLS IT across the roof -- Lee
	and Carter diving to the ground once again as the bomb slides
	to the center of the roof - COMING TO A STOP RIGHT IN FRONT
	OF ISABELLA.  She's wearing a bathrobe now, clearly pissed
	off as she slowly bends down and picks up the package.

				ISABELLA
		Get on your feet.

	Lee and Carter stand and face Isabella - watch as Isabella
	begins to open the package.

				CARTER
		I wouldn't do that!!!

				LEE
		It's a bomb.

	Isabella opens the package, removing a stack of a HUNDRED
	DOLLAR BILLS.

				ISABELLA
		You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before
		I throw you both in jail for
		obstruction.

				CARTER
		Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you
		right now.

				ISABELLA
		I'm an undercover agent for the United
		States Secret Service.

				CARTER
		How do we know you're not lying?  Let me
		see your badge.

	Isabella opens her bathrobe -- WE SEE a small BADGE pinned to
	her bra.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Let me see it again?

				LEE
		We can help you.  I'm a detective in
		Hong Kong.

				ISABELLA
		I know who you are, Inspector Lee.

				LEE
		Then you know I'm not walking away from
		this case.

				CARTER
		Yeah, that's right.

				ISABELLA
		We need to get out of sight.  Come down
		to my suite.

	INT. ISABELLA'S SUITE - LATER

				ISABELLA
			(she locks the door)
		Look, I've been working this case for
		months now...

				CARTER
		So what's your story?

				ISABELLA
		They think I'm a crooked customs agent.

	Lee examines the stack of HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS from Hu Li's
	package.  Carter checks out the suite, pocketing some of the
	food from the mini fridge.

				LEE
		Is this a payoff?

				ISABELLA
		No.  It's a sample.  You guys ever heard
		of the Superbill?

				CARTER
		It's a myth.  Some kind of counterfeit.

				ISABELLA
		It's much more than a counterfeit.  14
		out of 15 world banks can't tell the
		difference.  The paper is Crane linen
		blend -- and the bills are printed on
		U.S. Intaglio presses.

				CARTER
		How're they getting into the U.S. Mint
		to use the presses?

				ISABELLA
		In 1959, the United States was very
		friendly with the Shah of Iran.  We
		wanted his oil, so for the Shah's
		birthday, the government gave him a gift
		-- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press.  The
		only one to ever leave the country. 
		Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that
		press on the black market.

				LEE
		Five years ago?!  
			(beat)
		That's right before he left the force.

	Lee and Carter exchange looks.

				ISABELLA
		It wasn't hard to spot the fakes until
		this past year.  Then Tan got hold of
		one of a kind Swiss made hundred dollar
		plates -- and started making superbills.

				LEE
			(understanding)
		And Hu Li killed him for the plates.

				ISABELLA
		Yes.  They've printed and shipped one
		hundred million dollars, and there's
		only one way to spot a fake.

	Isabella lights a HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL on fire, and it burns
	RED.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		They use an optical transfer ink from
		India that burns red -- the real ink
		burns black.

				CARTER
		What the hell are they going to do with
		a hundred million dollars in funny
		money?

				ISABELLA
		The real question is, where are the
		plates?  If we can find the plates, we
		can stop the whole operation.

	Isabella thinks for a beat.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		Maybe that's where you can help us. 
		Carter, this is your city, right?

	Carter nods.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		And Lee, you know Hu Li and the Triads?

	Lee nods.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		Okay, find out where Hu Li's keeping the
		plates.
			(hands Lee a card with a phone
			 number)
		Welcome aboard, gentlemen.  From this
		moment on, you're working for the United
		States Secret Service.

	Isabella opens the door to let Lee and Carter out.  They exit
	quickly, trying to hide their excitement.  CAMERA STAYS on
	Isabella as she takes out her CELL PHONE, punches in a
	number.

				STERLING (O.S.)
		Sterling.

				ISABELLA
		Lee and Carter are officially out of the
		Secret Service's way...

	EXT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter, both wearing dark sunglasses, walk through
	the street trying their best to look like Secret Service
	Agents.  They approach Carter's parked VETTE.

				CARTER
		Secret Service Agent Carter.  This is my
		calling, Lee. 
		Give me six months and I'll be in
		Washington protecting a white guy.

				LEE
		We both know you would never take a
		bullet for someone else.

				CARTER
		They don't know that.  What are they
		gonna do, try and shoot the President
		during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella
		can pull some strings.  You saw the way
		she was staring at me.

				LEE
		She never even looked at you.

				CARTER
		You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked
		me.  I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're
		third world ugly.

				LEE
		I am not third world ugly.  Women like
		me, they think I'm cute.  Like Snoopy.

				CARTER
		Snoopy is about six inches taller than
		you.  I'm sorry, Lee, you never had a
		chance.

	Carter's had the last word, he gets into the Vette.  Lee
	reluctantly gets in, too.
			
			EXT. CRENSHAW KITCHEN - CHINESE SOUL FOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	Carter's Vette pulls up in front of a hole in the wall.  

	INT. CRENSHAW KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

	Carter and Lee pass through the restaurant, only two tables
	are occupied.

	INT. KITCHEN

	Carter and Lee enter the busy kitchen where the OWNER, a
	BLACK MAN named KENNY, is yelling in Chinese to an over
	worked waiter.  Kenny's wife, a spectacular looking Chinese
	woman, works the stove.  A couple of cute half-black, half
	Asian kids run around the kitchen.

				CARTER
		Kenny!  How you doin'?

	Kenny looks up at Carter.  A cool, appraising glance.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		How's the action tonight?  The house
		making out okay?

	Kenny follows as Carter opens a door to --

	INT. BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	MEN seated around several card tables, playing MAH-JONGG for
	big money.  Lee and Kenny follow Carter inside.  It's very
	smokey and very crowded.

				CARTER
			(to Kenny)
		This is where I say I'm LAPD in a loud
		voice, they all scream and run and shit. 
		Watch.  It's real funny.

	Kenny grabs Carter's shoulder, pulling him aside.

				KENNY
		Come with me.

	INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

	Kenny leads Carter and Lee in, closes the door.

				KENNY
		Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong
		Kong, James.

				CARTER
		What??  Where'd you hear that?

				KENNY
		I got my sources.

				CARTER
		And I got mine, meaning you.  Nice how
		that works out.
			(beat)
		I'm serious this time, I'm closing this
		place down.

				KENNY
		James, you see my kids back there?  You
		know how much I'm paying for private
		school?  How can you come in here with
		this attitude, you being little Chang's
		godfather?

				CARTER
		Little Chang is gonna have to go visit
		his daddy in jail if you don't
		cooperate.

				KENNY
		Jail!?  James, you better back off. 
		Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.

				CARTER
		I'd like to see you try.

	Kenny takes a step back and throws a lightning fast martial
	arts move.  Lee gets in front of Carter to protect him --
	countering Kenny's move.

				KENNY
			(to Lee)
		We're on, then.

	Kenny throws out another precision martial arts sequence --
	Lee BLOCKS -- Kenny ends in an advanced fighting stance.

				LEE
			(impressed)
		That's a good Twisting Tiger -- where
		did you learn that?

	They switch to Chinese.

				KENNY
		Master Ching taught me.

				LEE
		The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?

				KENNY
		No.  Freddy Ching's, in Crenshaw.

	Lee smiles, Carter looks back and forth from Lee to Kenny.

				KENNY (CONT'D)
		What are you doing hanging out with Baby
		Duck?

				LEE
		Baby Duck?

				KENNY
		That's what we all used to call him when
		he was a kid -- cause he was always
		quacking.  Never shut up.

				CARTER
		I heard that.

	Lee and Kenny laugh.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Look, I need some info and I don't have
		time to play around.

				KENNY
		Is this about the funny money?

				CARTER
		How'd you know?

				KENNY
		You've been asking loud questions in all
		the wrong places all morning.  How come
		you always save me for last, James? 
		When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't
		happen I don't know about.

				CARTER
		So tell me what you know.

				KENNY
		I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty
		good double sawbuck -- but you knew that
		too, didn't you?

				CARTER
		Yeah.  We already been there.  This is
		big, Kenny.  Benjamins.  Secret Service
		calls 'em superbills.  Banks can't even
		tell the difference.

	Kenny considers this for a moment.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		What?

				KENNY
		One of my regulars lost fifty thousand
		dollars at the table here last week.  I
		was about to send my boys down to tune
		his ass up, when the guy comes in and
		pays off the whole thing.  Including the
		vig -- brand new sequential hundred
		dollar bills.  I knew something was
		wrong.  Cause this guy's got a regular
		job, no way he comes up with fifty grand
		in cash. 
		But I tested the bills, infrared.  The
		whole thing.  And they checked out. 
		100%.

				LEE
		Do you still have the bills?

				KENNY
		I still have my lunch money from third
		grade.

				CARTER
		Lemme see 'em.

	Kenny pushes a Chinese painting aside to reveal a WALL SAFE. 
	He opens the safe and hands Carter a $100 bill.  Carter
	checks it out.

				KENNY
		See.  It's perfect.

	Carter takes out a LIGHTER and holds the flame to it.

				KENNY (CONT'D)
		Whoa, what are you doing?

	Kenny's question is answered as the BILL BURNS BRIGHT RED.

				KENNY (CONT'D)
			(pissed off)
		I knew it.  The guy's name is Zing.  He
		works at the kitchen at Reign Plaza.

				CARTER
		All right, Kenny.  Thanks.  You're off
		the hook.  For now.

	Carter and Lee move for the door.

				KENNY
		You sure you guys don't want to stay and
		have a bite?  My wife's got the best mu
		shu this side of Compton.

	Carter and Lee exchange a look as we CUT TO:
			
			EXT. REIGN PLAZA - DAY

	Establishing.  Carter and Lee park their car and walk inside.

	EXT. REIGN SHIPPING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Carter and Lee enter.

				CARTER
			(to a worker)
		We're looking for a guy named Zing.  Is
		he here?

	Zing hears Carter, turns and sees them.  Then RUNS.  Carter
	and Lee exchange looks and run after him.

	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Zing sprints down an employee hallway, through a doorway and
	down some stairs.  Carter and Lee in pursuit.

	EXT. LOADING DOCK PLATFORM - REIGN PLAZA - CONTINUOUS

	Carter and Lee burst out the door at the bottom of the
	stairway -- coming almost face to face with --

	HU LI

	Who has her gun out.  Waiting for them.  ISABELLA is standing
	near by, and ZING is visible off to the side.  An 18-WHEELER
	in the loading bay is just being shut and locked.  A LIMO is
	parked beside it.

	Lee and Carter both assume fighting positions.  When most of
	the other WORKERS pull guns; other TRIAD SOLDIERS step out,
	putting their guns close on Lee and Carter.  They can't blink
	without getting mowed down.

				HU LI
			(in Chinese)
		The great Chief Inspector Lee -- I will
		be remembered for ridding the Triads of
		your petulance.

	Hu Li savors the moment.

				CARTER
		I hope you just said I have no business
		being here, 'cos I was just leaving.

	Carter starts to leave, and Hu Li trains her gun on him,
	freezing him in his tracks.  Isabella slowly walks several
	feet, ending up behind Lee as she speaks.

				ISABELLA
		Hu Li, I think there's someone who will
		want to talk to them first.

	Hu Li looks at Isabella, nods an acknowledgement.  BANG!  Lee
	falls.  Isabella's knocked him out from behind with the butt
	of her gun.

	BANG!  Carter drops to one knee as Hu Li POUNDS him across
	the jaw with her fist.

				CARTER
		...oh, that's a filling right there. 
		That's gonna cost you.

	Hu Li lunges forward and KICKS Carter, sending him backwards.

				HU LI
		Put them in the truck.

	The WORKERS pick up Lee, bring him to the back of the truck.

				CARTER
		I should kill you right now, but I'm
		gonna let you live, 'cause you're fine,
		and maybe you can be reformed.

	The WORKERS start towards Carter.  He holds up his hands.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		No more hitting.  I'll get in the truck
		myself.

	As Carter walks towards the truck by Hu Li, they exchange a
	look of sheer hatred.  As soon as he passes by her, Hu Li
	COLDCOCKS Carter with her gun.

	EXT. LOADING DOCK PLATFORM - DAY

	The eighteen wheeler, the limo and the black Lincoln Town car
	pull out of the loading dock, headed for the highway.

	EXT. EIGHTEEN WHEELER - DAY

	The truck pulls onto a HIGHWAY, the LIMO close behind it.

	INT. EIGHTEEN WHEELER - TRUCK BED - DAY

	LEE and CARTER are in the back with crates filled with MONEY.

	They're both in pain, trying to recover from the head blows. 
	Carter is flexing his battered body.

				LEE
		Are you okay?

				CARTER
		What's the first thing I told you --
		never trust nobody.  How could you fall
		for that shit?  I knew she was dirty.

				LEE
		She saved our lives.

				CARTER
		For how long?  Face it, Lee, she's
		playing both sides.

	Lee looks disappointed.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Look, man I'm sorry.  I know you got a
		thing for her.

				LEE
		Shhh, my head hurts.

				CARTER
		I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh"
		me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky
		Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang
		Long are not in South Central.  I didn't
		have to help you.

				LEE
		Why did you help me?

				CARTER
		It doesn't matter.

	Lee thinks about this for a BEAT.

				LEE
		I'm not used to having a partner.

				CARTER
		We are not partners.  Between your
		daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just
		took, as far as I can tell all partners
		get you is dead.

				LEE
		Well we're not friends.

				CARTER
		You got that right.  And we ain't
		brothers.  Maybe we should just end this
		right here.

				LEE
		Fine with me.

				CARTER
		I won't talk to you, you don't talk to
		me.  We'll die in peace.

				LEE
		See you in the next world.

	A BEAT OF SILENCE

				CARTER
		I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I
		won't see you in the next world.

				LEE
		Fine. 

				CARTER
		I believe in heaven.  You people believe
		in heaven?

				LEE
		Yes.  We have heaven.

				CARTER
		Is it the same heaven, or is it a
		Chinese heaven?

				LEE
		What's a Chinese heaven?

				CARTER
		I thought it might be like those five
		foot and under basketball leagues.  They
		don't let everybody in.

				LEE
		I think we should stop talking.

				CARTER
		Fine by me.

	ANOTHER BEAT OF SILENCE

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		You thinking about that girl that dumped
		you?

				LEE
		No.

				CARTER
		If she was the right girl, you'd be
		thinking about her.

				LEE
		Mind your own business.

				CARTER
		How was the sex?

				LEE
		There was no sex.  She was very
		traditional.  We were waiting until we
		were married.

				CARTER
		You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No
		mu-shu?

				LEE
		No mu-shu.

				CARTER
		What about a little king pao chicken?

				LEE
		No kung pao chicken.  Never.

				CARTER
		Steamed dumplings?

				LEE
		Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But
		only when she was drunk.

				CARTER
		That's rough, man.  If I don't get
		steamed dumplings once a week, I go
		crazy.

				LEE
		Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think
		I have a good voice?

				CARTER
		Are you serious?

				LEE
		Forget it.  It doesn't matter.

	Lee turns away from Carter.

				CARTER
		As long as you're asking...I think you
		have a pretty good voice.

				LEE
		I knew it.  What does she know.  You
		want me to sing something?

				CARTER
		That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long
		usually kill their victims?

				LEE
		They'll probably torture us first, shock
		our privates, then put two bullets in
		our eyes and one in the back of the
		head.

				CARTER
		Go ahead.  Sing your ass off.

	Lee clears his voice.

				LEE
		Did you happen to see the most beautiful
		girl in the world...and if you did, was
		she crying, crying...hey!

	EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY

	The 18-WHEELER drives by followed by the LIMO.

	INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY

	Hu Li and Isabella sit in the back of one of the limos that
	is driving behind the truck.  Hu Li is on the car phone.

				HU LI
		Don't worry, the plates are safe.  Yes,
		the dragon's been fed.

	She HANGS UP and glances at Isabella, who is doing her best
	to appear completely uninterested.

	EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

	The LIMO splits off from the 18-WHEELER.

	INT. 18-WHEELER - TRUCK BED - CONTINUOUS

	Carter works at opening one of the crates.  Lee steps up,
	takes a deep breath, searches the crate looking for the sweet
	spot, and PUNCHES a hole in one of the thick boards.  They
	start prying the crate open.

				CARTER
		Very nice.

				LEE
		It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak
		spot.  You ignore everything around you,
		and put all your energy into one perfect
		strike.

				CARTER
		I'll remember that next time I'm
		fighting a box.

	Carter opens the crate -- it's filled with SUPERBILLS, about
	$1,000,000 worth.  He tosses a stack to Lee.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Hello, Benjamin.

				LEE
		Who's Benjamin?

				CARTER
		Benjamin Franklin, he discovered
		electricity.

				LEE
		A Chinese man discovered electricity.

				CARTER
		No Chinese man discovered electricity.

				LEE
		Yes he did.  He also invented the
		bicycle.

				CARTER
		Now that I believe.

	Carter pockets two stacks of superbills.  Lee looks at him.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		You never know.  Besides, I always
		wanted to die rich.

	The truck lurches.

				LEE
		We're slowing down.  This must be it.

				CARTER
		End of the line.

				LEE
		You've been a good friend, James Carter.

				CARTER
		Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting
		corny on me, Lee.  I'll kick your ass
		from here to Compton.

				LEE
		You could never kick my ass.  You mama's
		boy.

				CARTER
		Don't you talk about my mama.
			(winks at Lee)
		That's more like it.

	EXT. 18-WHEELER - CONTINUOUS

	The truck is parked in the underground loading docks.  It's
	approached by FOUR TRIAD SOLDIERS.  Soldier #1 opens the
	TRUCK'S DOUBLE DOORS to find.

	Lee and Carter are gone.  Except for boxes of money, the
	truck bed is EMPTY.

	Two soldiers enter the truck bed.

	ANGLE UP TO REVEAL

	Lee and Carter WEDGED up against the CEILING of the truck
	bed.  Above the doors and over the soldiers.

	Lee and Carter SWING DOWN in unison -- knocking both soldiers
	to the ground.  In the next instant:

	ON LEE

	still holding on to the door frame -- swings and backflips
	onto the roof of the truck.

	ON CARTER

	who swings onto the ground -- grabbing one of the guards to
	use a shield as gunfire erupts.

	Lee jumps off the truck, knocking the last guard to the
	ground.  He then grabs the guard Carter is using as a shield
	and together THEY SWING him into the truck -- KNOCKING DOWN
	the first two guards.

	Carter and Lee slam the back doors SHUT -- bolting them
	CLOSED and run like hell - scrambling into what looks like
	the closest way out:

	A LARGE OPEN PIPE on the side of the tunnel.

	INT. SEWER TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter run through - it extends out from the
	underground loading docks.

				LEE
		This way.  I see some lights.

	Lee and Carter spot a tiny sliver of light coming through a
	MANHOLE COVER.  They start climbing up the metal stairs that
	lead up to the street.

	EXT. LAS VEGAS BLVD. - DUSK

	The blvd.'s packed with PEOPLE and CARS.  

	CLOSE ON

	Lee and Carter coming up from the manhole -- standing
	together in stunned disbelief as they look out at the LAS
	VEGAS STRIP.  They cover their eyes, blinded by the greatest
	light show in the world.

				LEE
		Vegas...

				CARTER
		Lee.  I just got an idea how someone
		could launder a hundred million dollars
		in cash.

	They both turn around and come FACE TO FACE WITH:

	A TEN-STORY DRAGON.  Fire shoots from its nostrils every 60
	SECONDS.
			
			EXT. RED DRAGON HOTEL AND CASINO - NIGHT

	FIRE BALLS BLOW out over the strip as Lee and Carter look up
	at the RED DRAGON.  The HUGE NEON SIGN READS: GRAND OPENING -
	EVERYBODY'S A WINNER!

	Lee and Carter come out of the sewer.

				LEE
		Red Dragon.

				CARTER
		That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat.

	Lee and Carter watch as limos pull up to the front of the
	hotel -- it's like a HOLLYWOOD PREMIERE.  The richest of the
	rich are making their way inside.

				LEE
		Let's go.

				CARTER
		Wait a second.  We can't go in like
		this.  Look at this place, we gotta look
		fly.  We gotta Mac out.

				LEE
		What is Mac out?

				CARTER
		Follow me my Asian brother.

	Carter and Lee start to walk away.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Just stay down wind, because I think you
		stepped in some serious rat shit down
		there.

	EXT. VERSACE BOUTIQUE - NIGHT

	Lee and Carter are walking into the upscale clothing store.

	INT. VERSACE BOUTIQUE - CONTINUOUS

	As they enter, a SALESMAN approaches them.

				SALESMAN
		May I help you gentlemen?

	Carter flashes his biggest smile as he pulls out a stack of
	superbills.

				CARTER
		Black.  42-long.  Nothing touches this
		body but pure silk.  And get my partner
		something from the children's
		department.

	Carter puts his hand on Lee's shoulder.

				SALESMAN
		Would your partner like silk as well?  I
		personally like it when a couple
		matches.

	Carter takes his hand off Lee's shoulder.

				CARTER
		Couple?  No, you got it wrong, there's
		no couple here.  Just two single police
		officers working a very dangerous case.

				LEE
		Yes.  We have lots of big men chasing
		us.

				SALESMAN
		I'm sure all the boys are chasing you
		two.  Don't worry, I'll make you guys
		the bell of the ball.

	He WINKS as he walks off, and Carter looks at Lee.

				CARTER
		This is the last time I go shopping with
		you.

	EXT. RED DRAGON - NIGHT

	Lee and Carter enter frame, dressed to kill - perfectly
	tailored couture Versace suits, gold watches, the whole bit. 
	Le is awkward in "player" guise.

				CARTER
			(whispering)
		Remember, Lee, you're a player now.  You
		own the place.

	Carter pulls out his ALTOIDS, and he and Lee each take one as
	they walk through the doors.

				LEE
		I own the place.

	INT. RED DRAGON - CONTINUOUS

	Carter STRUTS through the lobby, Lee doing his best to
	imitate Carter's pimp and roll.  THEY WALK PAST THE GIANT
	BUDDHA --

				CARTER
		That looks exactly like my Uncle
		Darrell.

				LEE
		Buddha is the symbol of luck and good
		fortune.

				CARTER
		Buddha is the symbol for fat and lazy. 
		The man has the biggest tits in Asia.

	They are moving through the MAIN ENTRY HALL lined with TERRA
	COTTA CHINESE SOLDIERS - posed and dressed for battle.

	RICKSHAWS and BICYCLES take people through the hotel.  The
	MAIN CASINO is roped off and empty.  People crowded around
	the perimeter - a sign reads:

				SIGN
		$50,000 buy in -- EVERYBODY'S A WINNER!

	The LIGHTS DIM - a spotlight comes on and finds STEVEN REIGN
	on the balcony overlooking the ENTRANCE.

				STEVEN REIGN
		A thousand years ago, a small, wealthy
		village in China hired a young Dragon to
		guard their treasure in a cave, hoping
		to scare off potential bandits.  Their
		plan worked quite well, until the people
		of the village started sneaking the
		Dragon extra food -- hoping to make him
		bigger and stronger.  The Dragon ate so
		much and grew so big -- that he
		eventually got stuck inside the cave --
		and the treasure was stuck behind him
		for all eternity.
			(beat)
		Ladies and gentlemen, I have found that
		lost treasure.  It is here, inside the
		greatest casino in the world!  Welcome
		to the Red Dragon, where everybody is a
		winner!

	Reign smiles, flips a switch -- the CASINO COMES TO LIFE. 
	Fireworks, bright lights, endless rows of tables, dealers
	waiting.

	A BAND PLAYS on a stage in the casino lounge.

	Chinese ACROBATS perform suspended from the ceiling and on
	the balconies above.

	Applause all around as the FLAME shoots out of the dragon's
	nostrils and the acrobats perform.  Carter and Lee walk down
	the red carpet.

				CARTER
			(to waitress)
		Bring us some twelve-year old scotch...
			(to a cigarette girl)
		Get us a box of your finest cigars.
			(to a change girl)
		Give me ten dollars in nickels.
						
	INT. CASINO - NIGHT

	CLOSE ON

	Dice ROLLING on a craps table.

				CRAPS DEALER
		Winner!  Seven!

	We see BLACKJACK DEALERS BUSTING - paying out CUSTOMERS.

	Hundred dollar slot machines paying out jackpots.

	GAMBLERS winning all over the casino.  Then going to the main
	cage and exchanging their chips for SUPERBILLS.

				CARTER
		Look at this place, Lee.  The biggest
		front in the world.

	As people pour into the casino, Steven Reign is making his
	way through the crowd, shaking hands and posing for pictures.

				LEE
		Carter...here comes the rich white man.

				CARTER
		Wait here.  I'll handle this.

	As Carter walks off, a WOMAN grabs Lee and pulls him onto the
	dance floor.

	INT. LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

	The woman spins to face Lee, her face half-hidden under the
	dance floor lights.

				ISABELLA
		Put your arms around me.

				LEE
		Excuse me?

	Isabella grabs him around the waist, pulls him close.

				ISABELLA
		Hold me close.  There's cameras
		everywhere.

	An ASIAN BAND sings STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT as Lee tries his
	best to slow dance.  An intimate moment between Isabella and
	Lee, her face nestled in the crook of his neck, hiding her
	face.

				LEE
		What's going on?

				ISABELLA
		I need your help.

				LEE
		Last time you needed my help I ended up
		in the back of a truck.

				ISABELLA
		I'm undercover.  I had no choice.  You
		have to trust me.

	Lee starts to get into the music, moving his hips in a slow,
	sensual rhythm.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		You move well.

				LEE
		Just trying to make it look real.

				ISABELLA
		Look over there.  That's the eye in the
		sky room.

	Lee looks over her shoulder. 

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		Behind me is the soft count room.  We're
		pretty sure the plates are back there.

				LEE
		Why don't you go get them?

				ISABELLA
		If I'm wrong then my cover is blown.

				
	INT. CASINO - NIGHT

	As Steven Reign makes his way through the casino, Carter
	steps right in front of him, giving him a big hug.

				CARTER
		Stevie, how's it going my man?  Somebody
		get a picture, we can use it for a mug
		shot.

				STEVEN REIGN
		Detective Carter, you always seem to
		show up where you don't belong.

				CARTER
		Lemme ask you something, Steven.  And I
		want the truth.  Is there any way I can
		date your daughter?  Just dinner and a
		movie, maybe go listen to some jazz...

				STEVEN REIGN
		Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I
		crawled out from under the first rock. 
		Do you really think you can intimidate
		me here?

				CARTER
		You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most
		counterfeiters only get ten cents on the
		dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure
		genius.

				STEVEN REIGN
		You play games with me, Detective, and
		you'll lose every time.  Don't forget. 
		The odds are always in favor of the
		house.

	Reign walks off with his men.  Carter watches him leave.

	INT. DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT

	Lee is dancing close with Isabella.

				ISABELLA
		The Secret Service almost busted Reign
		at his casino in Macao, but the place
		burned down before we could move in.

				LEE
		How do I know I can trust you?

				ISABELLA
		Dip me!

	Lee dips her, holds her in his arms for a long BEAT.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		I'm asking for real now -- will you help
		the Secret Service?

				LEE
		No.
			(beat)
		But I'll help you.

	Lee holds her for a long BEAT, their lips almost touching. 
	He finally lets her go, and she disappears into the crowd. 
	Carter walks up, sees Lee standing alone on the dance floor.

				CARTER
		Lee, what the hell are you doing?

				LEE
		Dancing?

				CARTER
		Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong
		arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the
		line, and you're up here dancing with
		some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?

				LEE
		It was Isabella.  She says the plates
		are in the soft count room.

	Lee motions to the room, where WE SEE a SECURITY GUARD
	standing in front of a small door.

				CARTER
		Isabella?  Are you crazy, man?  She
		almost got us killed.  She's setting you
		up again!

				LEE
		No.  I'm going to find out.

				CARTER
		Wait a second.  There's guards all over
		the place.  You'll need a distraction.

	Carter looks around the casino.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		I'll go to the craps table, make a big
		scene.  When security comes over, you
		make your move.  

				LEE
		Try to keep them busy for five minutes.

				CARTER
		I'll give it my best shot.
						
			INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

	Carter walks up to a CRAPS TABLE, everyone turning to stare.

				CRAPS DEALER
		Sir, you're aware that we require a
		fifty-thousand dollar buy in to gamble
		here this weekend?

	Carter throws a HUNDRED THOUSAND in $100 BILLS onto the
	table.

				CARTER
		I saw the sign, I can read.  Now gimme a
		hundred-thousand in chips.  And a Diet
		Coke and some wash-n-dries.  Let's move,
		people, I came to play.

	The DEALER pushes 100K worth of CHIPS in front of Carter.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		What the hell is that?

				CRAPS DEALER
		Those are five hundred dollar chips.

				CARTER
		Did you give me five-hundred dollar
		chips because I'm black?

				CRAPS DEALER
		No, I just assumed...

				CARTER
		You assumed a brother coming in here can
		only afford five-hundred dollars a roll,
		is that right?  Are you a racist?

				CRAPS DEALER
		No, sir.

				CARTER
			(starting to scream)
		Everyone else at the table has thousand
		dollar chips, but the black man gets the
		nickel, is that it?  Did my people
		survive two-hundred years of slavery so
		you could send us back to the cotton
		fields with five-hundred dollar chips? 
		Do I look like Chicken George to you?

	The PIT BOSS gets on his walkie-talkie.

				PIT BOSS
		Floor security, we have a problem at
		table nine.

	EXT. SOFT COUNT ROOM - NIGHT

	The SECURITY GUARD lowers his walkie-talkie, starts moving
	towards Carter's table.

	INT. CRAPS TABLE - NIGHT

	TWO SECURITY GUARDS approach Carter's table.

				CARTER
		Answer me one question.  How come Ben
		Vereen isn't performing here at the
		hotel?  Is Ben Vereen not good enough
		for you people?

				PIT BOSS
		Lionel Ritchie is performing here
		tonight.

				CARTER
		Lionel Ritchie hasn't been black since
		the Commodores.

				PIT BOSS
		Sir, you're going to have to calm down.

	Carter watches as Lee moves past the guard and makes his way
	into the soft count room.

				CARTER
		I have a dream, where black people and
		white people can gamble together without
		getting different chips!

	A BIG CROWD has gathered as the Security Guards try and push
	their way through.  The pit boss picks up the phone, calls
	upstairs.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Sing with me!  "We shall overcome!"

	Carter starts clapping, and the confused crowd joins in as
	the Security Guards move in.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Thank you.  Now in the spirit of
		brotherhood, let's play craps!

	INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Lee walks into the hallway, moving like a cat as he hugs the
	walls and tries to make his way to the soft count room.

	He hears noise, TWO SECURITY GUARDS coming behind him through
	the casino door.  He has no choice but to crawl over the back
	of a money cart and hug the top.  He lies as still as he can,
	trying not to be seen -- until he realizes he's staring
	directly into the EYE IN THE SKY cameras that are in the
	ceiling.

	WE SEE LEE'S FACE

	as he passes directly under the camera, clearly mouthing the
	words "oh shit" as he rolls by.

	Lee looks to his left, sees the SOFT COUNT ROOM -- a mountain
	of COUNTERFEIT SUPERBILLS that are waiting to be paid out. 
	On the opposite side, the REAL MONEY is being WHEELED OUT
	toward a waiting TRUCK that is parked at the back door.

	Lee sees two more cameras in the ceiling, knows his cover is
	blown.  He jumps down off the cart, is standing in front of
	the locked vault.  There's no way to get the plates. 
	Isabella has set him up again.

	He turns and smiles at the confused SECURITY GUARDS.

				LEE
		Hi.  How's it going?  You guys have
		change for a twenty?

	The GUARDS make their move.  And Lee starts to fight them
	down the hall, using the cart as a shield as he RAMS into TWO
	MORE GUARDS, fights them off as he turns the corner toward
	the casino door -- but he gets slammed to the ground by a
	right cross.

	Hu Li threw the punch, a roll of quarters in her hand as she
	stands over him with FIVE TRIAD SOLDIERS.  She holds a knife
	to Lee's throat.

				HU LI
			(in Chinese)
		Open your mouth.

	She puts the small grenade in Lee's mouth, tapes it shut. 
	She holds the detonator in her hand.

				HU LI (CONT'D)
			(continuing in Chinese)
		That's a ying-tao grenade, Inspector. 
		Please follow me or I'll blow 32 teeth
		into your brain.

	INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

	A crowd has gathered behind Carter who is at the table
	rolling dice, a huge stack of chips in front of him.

				CRAPS DEALER
		Winner six!

				CARTER
		How much is that?

				CRAPS DEALER
		Two-hundred thousand!

				CARTER
		Two-hundred thousand dollars?  Who wants
		a hundred dollars?

	Carter turns to the MAN next to him, who wears a traditional
	AFRICAN ROBE and is standing with a giant blonde escort.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Here, your highness, have a hundred
		dollars.  The Viagra is on me tonight!

				GAMBLER
			(South African accent)
		I am not royalty, sir.

				CARTER
		Don't say that, we're all royalty.  My
		great grandmammy was Queen Nephertit --
		we probably cousins, man.  How much you
		got on the table?

				GAMBLER
		One million.

				CARTER
		Yeah, we definitely cousins now.  Who
		wants to blow on my hand for luck?

	Carter turns to a BIG TEXAN who is standing with a GORGEOUS
	YOUNG GIRL who is falling out of her dress.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Hey, Marlboro man, you mind if your lady
		blows on my hand for luck?

				TEXAN
			(embarrassed)
		She's not my lady.  She's my niece.

				CARTER
		Can I come over for Thanksgiving?  Come
		on, baby, give me some luck.

	The GIRL blows on the dice, and Carter stares down at her.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Nice blowing.  When's your next
		birthday, I'll be the cake.

				TEXAN
		Hey, buddy, watch yourself.

				CARTER
		Don't threaten me.  I got friends in
		this town that will bite off your ears. 
		Just sit tight, because I've got the
		dice and I am on fire!

	Carter throws the dice.

				CRAPS DEALER
		Winner, seven!

	The table erupts as Carter grabs the dice.

				CARTER
		Let it ride!
						
			INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

	The elevator doors OPEN and Lee is led toward the eye in the
	sky room by Hu Li and the three Triads.  As they walk into
	the room, the Triads remain outside guarding the room.

	INT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	FORTY VIDEO MONITORS show every inch of the hotel.  A MAN
	stands in front of the two-way mirror looking down at the
	casino, the reflection off the glass obscuring his features.

	Lee has the tape around his mouth and his hands tied behind
	his back as he's led into the room by Hu Li.

				RICKY TAN
		Imagine a business where people hand you
		money.  And you hand them back
		absolutely nothing.

	Ricky Tan - alive and well, turns around and stares at Lee. 
	Isabella is standing next to him.  Lee is shocked at the
	sight of Ricky Tan alive.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
		Now that's a true American dream. 
		Thanks to a few pieces of metal and a
		very greed driven US Customs agent.

	Ricky Tan walks toward Lee, starts to smile.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
		Look at you, you're ridiculous.  You
		know it didn't have to be like this. 
		But it's too bad!  Like father, like
		son.

	Lee stares at Isabella for a BEAT.  Hu Li motions to one of
	the monitors.

				HU LI
			(in Chinese)
		He's going for the plates.

	Ricky Tan looks at one of the MONITORS, sees Steven Reign
	walking down a hallway, about to walk into the PENTHOUSE
	SUITE.

				RICKY TAN
		Look at this old fool, what does he
		think he's doing?

	Ricky Tan shifts his attention back to Lee.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
		It's almost impossible to find a partner
		that's trustworthy and loyal.  Wouldn't
		you agree, Lee?

	ON ANOTHER SCREEN

	We see Carter at the craps table having the time of his life. 
	Ricky Tan turns to walk out of the room, motioning to
	Isabella as he goes.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
		Well, at least you will die with honor. 
		But choy Gien.

	SUBTITLES: "Won't see you again."

	INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

	Carter has two racks of chips in front of him, a huge crowd
	surrounding him.

				CRAPS DEALER
		Winner!  Four, winner!

				CARTER
		I'm up a hundred and fifty-grand. 
		That's a Ferrari.  Do they sell those
		here in the gift shop?  Somebody cash me
		out!

	Several TRIAD SOLDIERS dressed like SECURITY GUARDS approach
	Carter's table.

				PIT BOSS
		Sir, we'd like to escort you to the
		cashier.

				CARTER
		That would be great.  Don't want any of
		these rich white people to jump me.

	As they walk toward the door marked "VIP ROOM", Carter
	glances at the MEN, knows he's in deep shit.

	INT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - NIGHT

	Ricky Tan turns to Hu Li.

				RICKY TAN
		Chai Hu Li.
			("Little Fox")
		Have fun.

	Ricky Tan walks out.  Hu Li holds the detonator up to Lee,
	plays with the button.

				HU LI
			(in Chinese)
		In a few minutes...you'll beg me to push
		this button.

	Hu Li pulls her KNIFE, moves towards Lee.  She holds the
	blade to his face.  About to cut him.  When Isabella pulls
	her gun.

	Isabella walks toward Lee, whose hands are still tied behind
	his back.  Hu Li clutches the detonator in one hand, her
	knife in the other.  She takes a step toward Isabella.

				ISABELLA
		It's time to end this, Inspector.

	Isabella cocks the gun, spins back and kicks the detonator
	from Hu Li's hand -- slamming her against the wall and
	sticking the gun under her chin.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		Don't move!  United States Secret
		Service.

	Hu Li WHIPS her KNIFE around, catches Isabella across the
	hand -- the GUN SLIDING across the room near the detonator --
	the TWO WOMEN fight around it.

	Lee watches them almost step on it - dives to the floor and
	rolls toward the detonator.  He's about to grab it when:

	THE TRIADS OPEN THE DOOR

	They're about to move in.

				HU LI
		Get the detonator!

	The Triads go for the detonator -- as Lee gets to his feet,
	KICKS Hu Li's legs out from under her.

	One of the Triads about to pick up the detonator - but Lee
	gets to him first.  He fights with one hand tied behind his
	back.

	Hu Li and Isabella fight it out in the EYE IN THE SKY ROOM.

	Lee gets kicked towards the Eye In The Sky WINDOW.

	INT. CASINO - CASHIER

	Two security guards lead Carter away from the table when:

	CRASH!

	An AIRBORNE Lee rockets through the EYE IN THE SKY WINDOW. 
	In a rain of glass, he lands HARD on the casino floor.

	The NOISE grabs everyone's attention, including:

				CARTER
		Lee!!

	The guards restrain him.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Lemme ask you something.  Any of you
		ever felt $500,000 before?

	He SLAMS THE RACK OF CHIPS ACROSS THEIR FACES -- chips flying
	as the GUARDS hit the floor.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Doesn't feel so good, does it?

	INT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Hu Li picks up the detonator.  WHACK!  A heeled foot kicks it
	from her grasp.  Isabella has recovered!  The detonator FLIES
	OUT THE BROKEN WINDOW.

	INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

	On his back, Lee watches the detonator SAIL OVER HIS HEAD AND
	DISAPPEAR into the crowd.  It lands on a DRINK CART.  Before
	Lee can get there, a WAITRESS changes trays and carries the
	detonator on her rounds.

	Panicked, Lee searches for the detonator.  He JUMPS atop a
	BLACKJACK TABLE to get a better vantage.  He can't see it,
	but he does see:

	ACROSS THE CASINO

	Carter on top of a CRAPS TABLE, keeping security guards at
	bay with a croupier stick.

				CARTER
		Black man gets on a hot streak and
		you're all trippin'?

	Carter and Lee see each other.  They have the same
	simultaneous though:

				CARTER (CONT'D)
			(help!)
		Lee!

				LEE
			(help!)
		MMMMMM!!!!

	Carter is Lee's only hope to get the bomb out of his mouth. 
	But from here to there, a MASS OF PEOPLE.  The quickest way
	is the HIGH WAY.

	Lee leaps from TABLE to TABLE.  Scattering playing cards. 
	Reaching the carpeted divide...Lee doesn't stop. 
	He launches off the bent-over back of a high roller --
	landing on a RICKSHAW, SURFING IT to the tables on the other
	side.

	Carter looks around for Lee, catches a glimpse of the Eye in
	the Sky Room.  He grins.

				CARTER
		Check it out.  Catfight!

	POW!  He socks a GUARD in the face.

	INT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Isabella and Hu Li are locked in battle.  Rolling to the
	floor, they both see the gun.  They scramble over each other
	to get to it first.

	INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

	A security guard CLIMBS on the table to level Carter when Lee
	arrives.  He kicks the guard off and turns to Carter, his
	plea MUFFLED.

				CARTER
		What the HELL are you doing with tape on
		your face?

	No time to explain -- two more security guards arrive.  Kicks
	and punches fly, but Lee CAN'T GET HIT IN THE MOUTH!  He bobs
	and weaves, holding his hands to Carter to untie them in
	between swings.  Suddenly:

	BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  GUNSHOTS from the Eye In The Sky Room.

	Everyone HITS THE DECK.  Carter and Lee dive on to the floor
	as panic ripples through the Casino.  People FLEE for the
	EXITS.

	THE WAITRESS DESERTS HER TRAY.  It gets knocked over and TIPS
	on the floor.  The DETONATOR LANDS feet away from Carter.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		This can't be good.

	Lee's eyes BUG - he sees it too, feet STAMPEDING past it!  A
	high heel misses it by a fraction of an inch.  He LUNGES for
	it, manages to CRADLE it in his taped hands when --

	WHAM!  He is BUMPED and it FLIES AWAY.  The second it hits
	the floor, it is KICKED, skittering down the red carpet.

	ABOVE...the victor emerges in the Eye in the Sky Room.  Hu Li
	STEPS OUT on the PAGODA ROOF and JUMPS DOWN.  

	The DETONATOR ROLLS right past Hu Li.  As she bends to PICK
	up the detonator, Lee knows he won't get there in time. 
	Horrified, he SCREAMS at CARTER through the tape.

	Hu Li lifts the detonator.

	Carter finally pulls the TAPE OFF Lee's face.

	Lee SPITS the grenade into the air.

				LEE
			(diving on Carter)
		Bomb!!!

	Hu Li HITS the TRIGGER just as it lands on a roulette table.

	KABOOM!

	The table is BLOWN OFF IT'S FOUNDATION.  Chips and cash
	volcano.  Hu Li is blown backwards by the force of the blast. 
	SHEER PANDEMONIUM grips the casino.

	AS THE SMOKE CLEARS

	Carter and Lee peer out from behind a row of slot machines. 
	The place is deserted.

				CARTER
		Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in
		your mouth?

				LEE
		I did!

				CARTER
		No you didn't!

				LEE
		Yes I did.  I said MMMMMM!

	A hand on Carter's arm.  THIS IS SERIOUS.
			
						LEE (CONT'D)
		Ricky Tan is alive.

				CARTER
		What?!?!

				LEE
		We have to get to the Penthouse.

	Lee jumps up, SPRINTS toward the elevators at the dragon end
	of the casino.

				CARTER
		Hold on!

	Carter stuffs his pockets with chips, then races after Lee. 
	But halfway up the carpet.  Carter stops.  Lee turns to see
	what is holding him up.  

	Hu Li SURVIVED the blast and Carter has turned to face her.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		You go after Ricky.  I got this.

				LEE
		Carter...

				CARTER
		Just GO!

	Lee turns and runs off past the dragon.  Unfortunately, FIVE
	TRIADS block his path.  In a flurry of PUNCHES, Lee makes
	short work of them, and races toward the elevators.

	DEAD CENTER ON THE RED CARPET - HU LI AND CARTER FACE OFF!

	Each readying in their own manner.  Hu Li carefully wraps her
	long hair into a bun on top of her head.  Carter stretches,
	flexes, ready to sting like a bee.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		I'm not gonna hold you back this time
		just because you're a woman.  I'm gonna
		pretend you're a man.

	She pulls off her jacket, prepares to fight him in her
	undershirt.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		A very beautiful man with a perfect body
		who I'd like to take to the movies.

	She takes a sword from a Terra Cotta statue, SWINGS IT AROUND
	like a master.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		I may have been absent the day we went
		over this in karate class.

	Quick, Carter reaches for a fighting stick off a Terra Cotta
	soldier.  WHOOSH!  She SLICES IT IN HALF.  Carter reaches for
	another.  SLICE!  She's toying with him.

	INT. ELEVATOR BANK - NIGHT

	Lee's in the elevator as the doors close.  SUDDENLY, a HAND
	cuts through, parting the doors.

	It's ISABELLA!  A wound on her shoulder.

				LEE
		Are you okay?

				ISABELLA
		I'm fine.

	She steps in, too weak and starts to fall.  Lee grabs her and
	holds her in his arms.  HE gently helps her down.

				LEE
		I didn't know which side you were on.

				ISABELLA
		Now you know.

	DING!  The elevator doors open.  Isabella holds up a ROOM KEY
	- the key to the SUITE.  Lee takes the key, backs away and
	steps into the elevator.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		I'll try to get backup.  Be careful.

	The elevator doors close.
			
	INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - CONTINUOUS

	Steven Reign is closing the safe.  There are stacks of
	HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS on his desk, which he's putting in a
	black bag along with the plates.  As he turns around, he
	comes face-to-face with Ricky Tan.

				RICKY TAN
		American's love to gamble.  Don't they,
		Mr. Reign?

				STEVEN REIGN
		I'm cutting our deal short.  I'm
		leaving.

				RICKY TAN
		And my plates?

				STEVEN REIGN
		They stay with me.  I'm sure you won't
		have a problem with that.

	Reign shows Tan the gun in his belt.  Grabs the bag and
	starts to walk toward the door.

				RICKY TAN
		I enjoyed that little story you told
		about the Dragon and the treasure.  My
		mother used to tell it to me all the
		time.  Do you know the moral of that
		story, Mr. Reign?

				STEVEN REIGN
		Greed will imprison us all.

	Tan grabs Reign from behind and stabs him with a knife.

				RICKY TAN
		I hate that fortune cookie shit.

	Lee BURSTS through the suite door - watches as Reign falls
	dead to the floor.  Ricky takes the black bag off the desk.

				LEE
		Put the plates down.

	Ricky Tan looks down at the gun in Reign's belt.

	INT. CASINO - NIGHT

	WHOOSH!  Another Terra Cotta fighting stick is in half in
	Carter's hands.

				CARTER
		Will you STOP?!?!
			(picks up cocktail umbrella)
		What am I supposed to fight you with?

	No more toying.  Hu Li CHARGES Carter, who GRABS a ROULETTE
	WHEEL as a MAKESHIFT SHIELD.  She SLICES it in HALF!  He's
	got nowhere to hide.

	She JABS him with the sword.  Carter SCREAMS.  Falls back
	against the table, clutching his chest.  Hu Li WINDMILLS,
	kicking a Terra Cotta soldier on top of Carter, but --

	THWACK!

	The DOUBLE-BLADED BAMBOO POLE in its hand ricochets back and
	she is PIERCED THROUGH THE SHOULDER with the blade.  Staring
	at Carter in stunned disbelief, she drops to her knees.

	Carter walks toward her, considers his options, then KICKS
	HER IN THE HEAD, knocking her out.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		When are you people gonna learn?  Don't
		mess with the brothas!

	WEAK in the KNEES, Carter looks to the SOUND ON HIS CHEST. He
	reaches through the slice in his jacket.  Instead of a hand
	covered in blood, it comes out with a THICK WAD OF CASH!

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Thank you, Benjamin!

	Carter runs for the elevator.
						
				INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - CONTINUOUS

	Lee is walking toward Ricky Tan, the two men circling Reign's
	body.

				RICKY TAN
		You're just like your father, Lee.  All
		these years hiding behind his badge.  I
		wanted to help him, to share with him,
		but he was too afraid of change.  When
		you think about it, I didn't really kill
		him.  I just put him out of his misery.

				LEE
		Put the plates down.  It's over.

				RICKY TAN
		I don't think it's over.  There are
		casinos all over this country.  Let me
		make you a rich man, Lee.  Don't make
		the same mistake he did.

	Ricky glances at the gun in Reign's belt.

				LEE
		If you reach for that gun, I'm going to
		kill you.

				RICKY TAN
		Don't you remember?  I'm already dead.

	Ricky makes a play for the gun, but Lee is much too fast,
	taking the gun and pushing Ricky against the wall just as
	Carter bursts in the room.

				CARTER
		Hey, Ricky, how's it going man?  What's
		up, Lee?

	Lee has the gun pressed to Tan's head.  We've never seen him
	like this before.

				RICKY TAN
		Would you like me to tell you how your
		father died?

				CARTER
		Lee, you okay?

	Lee doesn't respond.  He keeps an eye on Ricky.

				RICKY TAN
		He never begged for his life.  Or tried
		to make a deal.  All that he asked me,
		just seconds before I pulled the
		trigger, was that I promise not to kill
		you.

	Lee's finger is on the trigger -- he wants to pull the
	trigger but can't.

				CARTER
		Lee, wait a second.  It's not worth it,
		man.  He's making you do this.

				LEE
		It's worth it to me.

				RICKY TAN
		Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you
		gonna spend the rest of your life hiding
		like your father?

				CARTER
		C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You
		won, now just put the gun down.

	Lee is trying to pull the trigger, but he can't.

				RICKY TAN
		That's what I thought.

	Tan takes the black bag and swings it toward Lee -- the
	plates hit him across the face and knock him down.

	THE GUN IS LOOSE

	Tan reaches for it and is about to pull the trigger when:

	Lee and Carter come flying at him TOGETHER.  Both KICKING HIM
	SQUARE IN THE CHEST.

	Tan falls back, SMASHING THROUGH THE WINDOW.  Lee tries to
	grab Tan's hand, their fingers touch for a split second.

	But Tan pulls his hand away and falls 20 STORIES to the
	street below.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	A TAXI is parked out front.  Tan's BODY SLAMS on the roof. 
	SMASHING THROUGH A SIGN ON TOP THAT READS: "EVERYBODY'S A
	WINNER!"

	INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - NIGHT

	Lee and Carter are looking down at the street, both relieved
	it's finally over.  Carter puts his hand on Lee's shoulder.

				CARTER
		I don't know about you, but I need a
		wine cooler.

	As they turn to the door -- Hu Li is walking toward them,
	bleeding and half-dead.  She has ANOTHER BOMB IN HER HAND. 
	This one twice the size of the one from earlier.

				HU LI
			(in Chinese)
		We'll go together, Inspector.

				CARTER
		Please tell me she just asked for a ride
		to the airport.

	Hu Li hits the switch - starts to smile.  Lee and Carter turn
	and RUN for the OPEN WINDOW.

	EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT

	Lee and Carter DIVE OUT THE WINDOW, grab a cable just as the
	PENTHOUSE BLOWS!

	The FIREBALL SHOOTS out as they start to slide down the side
	of the hotel.

	THEY SCREAM AS THE CABLE BREAKS.

	Lee and Carter SWING toward a HUGE "GRAND OPENING" BANNER. 
	They flip under it, do a loop before they SLAM AGAINST THE
	SIGN.

	It's KNOCKED LOOSE and they fall with it toward VEGAS BLVD.

	Lee and Carter hang on as they drop to the street.  A HUGE
	TRUCK speeds toward them as they hold on for their lives. 
	The entire STRIP SPEEDING toward them.

				LEE
		I can't believe I flew ten-thousand
		miles for this shit!!

	They lift their feet just as the TRUCK PASSES.  The sign dips
	and they fall straight down into the open sunroof of a LARGE
	STRETCH LIMO.
						
	INT. LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter land in the back.  Slam into their seats and
	try to catch their breath.  The TWO MEN STARTING TO LAUGH
	when they realize they're alive!

				CARTER
		We made it, man.

				LEE
		No problem.

	Lee and Carter look up to see the VERSACE SALESMAN and FOUR
	OF HIS FRIENDS sitting in the back of the limo staring at
	them.  The BOYS are all drinking champagne and dressed for a
	night on the town.

				VERSACE SALESMAN
		Well, there is a God after all.

	Lee and Carter exchange looks as the limo stops in front of
	the hotel.

				LIMO DRIVER
		Here we are.  The Red Dragon hotel.

	In front of the hotel WE SEE FIRE TRUCKS, AMBULANCE, POLICE
	CARS and Isabella and Sterling arresting TWENTY TRIADS.

				VERSACE SALESMAN
		We're all going gambling and then to see
		Siegried and Roy.  I hope you two are
		feeling lucky!

	INT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - NIGHT

	Lee is talking with a bandaged Isabella, who is standing with
	Sterling and several other SECRET SERVICE AGENTS.  Lee and
	Isabella hug goodbye.  As she walks off to board her plane,
	Lee slowly walks back to Carter who is smiling.

				CARTER
		I saw that.  She kissed you, didn't she? 
		You played it cool, though.  Walking
		away, never looking back.

				LEE
		She's going home to New York.  I need
		some ice.

	Lee and Carter watch as she gets on the plane.

				CARTER
		That your gate down there?

				LEE
		Yes.

				CARTER
		I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.

				LEE
		I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.

				CARTER
		You take care of yourself, Lee.

	Carter steps back, BOWS TO LEE.  Lee SHAKES CARTER'S HAND
	like a brother.  The two men smile.  Turn to walk away.

				LEE
		Carter, wait.  There's something I want
		you to have.

	Lee pulls a BADGE from his pocket.  Hands it to Carter.

				CARTER
		Your father's badge?  No way, man.  I
		can't take this.

				LEE
		It's okay.  I can finally let it go.

	Carter takes the badge.  Smiles.

				CARTER
		In that case, I got something for you. 
		I picked it up at the hotel.

	Carter pulls out a WAD OF CASH.

				LEE
		What is this?

				CARTER
		About fifty grand.  I won it at the
		tables.

				LEE
		No, Carter.  I can't take this.

				CARTER
		It's okay, I got lots more.

	Carter pulls out another wad of cash.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		They owe us, man.  That's the least they
		can do.

				LEE
		This money is evidence.

				CARTER
		Come on, Lee.  Stop being a cop for five
		minutes and live it up.  There must be
		something you want.

	Lee looks back toward Isabella.

				LEE
		I always wanted to go to Madison Square
		Garden.  See the Knicks play.

				CARTER
		New York City?

				LEE
		First class.

				CARTER
		The Plaza Hotel?

				LEE
		A little Mu-shu.

				CARTER
		Some Kung-Pao?

	They look at each other, smile.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		I could use a little vacation.

				LEE
		Amen to that, brother.

	As Lee and Carter start to walk away together, the MUSIC
	SWELLS.  "WAR" starts to PLAY.  They dance their way through
	a crowd of people, their arms raised as the two friends make
	their way through the airport.

	EXT. HONG KONG SKYLINE - ESTABLISHING

	A smoky haze dims the blazing sun.  Skyscrapers sit like
	watchtowers over the city, where East meets West for five and
	a half million people a day.

	EXT. AMERICAN CONSULATE - HONG KONG - DAY

	THE AMERICAN EMBASSY - U.S. and Chinese flags side by side. 

	HU LI, dark glasses, EXITS and slowly moves toward a STREET
	VENDOR across the street.

	She pays for an order of pork bao; as she takes her first
	bite we see:

	THE EXPLOSION BEHIND HER

	TWO OFFICES ON THE SIXTH FLOOR BLOWN OUT - a huge fireball
	erupting over one side of the embassy.

	People panic and run.  Hu Li doesn't even flinch.  She takes
	a bite of her pork bao as she casually turns to the stunned
	street vendor.

				HU LI
			(Chinese, subtitled)
		Someone better call the police.

	EXT./INT. LEE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

	The passenger window rolls down and we see Carter, styling in
	a Chinese-cut suit.  He's holding a Chinese-English
	dictionary, leaning out the window - giving his best "do me"
	look to two girls in a convertible.

				CARTER
			(int Chinese)
		Deng wa lu yun cai-shen wu.

	The HORRIFIED GIRLS speed off, and Carter turns to Lee, who
	is driving and singing to his radio.

				LEE
			(singing)
		...wish they all could be California...
		wish they all could be California
		girls...

	Carter ejects the BEACH BOYS CD from the stereo and TOSSES it
	out of the SUNROOF.

				CARTER
		I warned you about playing that shit
		when I'm in the car.

				LEE
		That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a
		Chinese man's CD.

				CARTER
		Did you see the way those girls drove
		off?  I did you a favor.

				LEE
		Those girls drove off because of you.

				CARTER
		All I did was invite them for a drink.

				LEE
		You invited them to get naked and
		sacrifice a small goat.

				CARTER
			(checking Chinese-English
			 dictionary)
		I said that?  Which word was "goat?"

	Lee picks up his CD case.

				LEE
		You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys
		Greatest Hits, Volume Two.

				CARTER
		Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've
		been here three days and we haven't done
		shit.  We haven't been to a club,
		haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on
		vacation, and I want some mu-shu.

				LEE
		Mu-shu?  You're hungry?

				CARTER
		Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some
		women.  Now stop playing dumb and show
		me the shu!

	Carter flips through the dictionary.  A CALL COMES in over
	LEE'S CELL PHONE.

	INTERCUT

	INT. SUPERINDENDENT CHIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

	The following conversation is in Chinese, English subtitles.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		Lee, there was a bombing at the American
		Embassy.  Two American translators were
		killed.

				LEE
		Any leads?

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
			(beat)
		We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't
		want to take the case, I'll understand.

				LEE
		It's my responsibility.

	Lee hangs up the cell phone.

				CARTER
		What was that?  Did you just pick up a
		case?  Did we just take another damn
		case on my vacation?

	Lee smiles at Carter.

				LEE
		Of course not.  My Superindendent
		invited us to a club tonight.  Big
		party.

				CARTER
		Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will
		kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard
		you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.

				LEE
		Carter, would I lie to you?
						
			EXT. RAVEN CLUB - NIGHT

	Carter follows Lee out of the car, the two men making their
	way to the door of the Raven Club.  Carter is combing his
	hair, getting himself ready for a night on the town, stopping
	when he spots two hot WOMEN walking into the club.

				CARTER
		That's what I'm talking about.  A real
		Hong Kong night club.  You want an
		Altoid?

				LEE
		No.

				CARTER
		You better take one.  Your breath has
		been a little funky all day.  Let me
		look at you.

	Carter looks at Lee.  Fixes his collar.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Just relax and don't worry about a
		thing.  I'll hook you up in there.  You
		got condoms?

				LEE
		No.  

				CARTER
		Take this.  It's a Magnum.  You can fold
		it in half.

	Carter dances through the door, Lee follows.

	INT. RAVEN CLUB - NIGHT

	A dark, upscale club that is packed with GANGSTERS, BEAUTIFUL
	GIRLS and CIVILIANS.  Lee and Carter walk in.  Lee is trying
	to keep a low profile as Carter stares up at the stage, where
	a man sings Karaoke -- the most painful rendition of Michael
	Jackson's "DON'T STOP 'TILL YOU GET ENOUGH."

				LEE
		I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. 
		They don't like tourists in here, so try
		to blend in.

				CARTER
		Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than
		everyone here.  Where you going?

				LEE
		Bathroom.

	Lee walks off, trying not to be seen as Carter steps up to
	the bar, takes a seat next to TWO CHINESE THUGS.

				CARTER
		How you boys doing tonight?

	The thugs ignore Carter as he motions to the stage, where the
	OLD MAN continues to sing.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		That is the worst singing I've ever
		heard.  That sounds like something you'd
		hear in prison after lights out.

	The thugs continue to ignore Carter.

	INT. RAVEN CLUB - BACK HALL - NIGHT

	Lee makes his way down a hallway -- looks through an open
	door - sees a private room.  Several TRIADS are using hi-tech
	MACHINES to count stacks of AMERICAN HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS.

				CARTER (V.O.)
		Get closer to my body now.  And just
		love me, till you don't know how...

	Lee steps back into shadow -- does a double take as he
	realizes he's hearing Carter belting out "DON'T STOP 'TILL
	YOU GET ENOUGH."

	INT. RAVEN CLUB - CONTINUOUS

	A room full of Chinese sitting with their mouths open,
	watching Carter on the Karaoke stage doing a dead-on Michael
	Jackson, singing his heart out.  Dancing and making eyes at a
	few of the smitten women who are watching him.

				LEE
			(whispering from side of stage)
		Carter, get off that stage!

				CARTER
		Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a
		star, Lee.  A god to these people!

	Carter resumes singing, really getting down.  Moonwalking to
	the EDGE of the STATE where Lee PULLS HIM OFF.

				LEE
		This is a gangster bar, we're here
		undercover.

				CARTER
		I knew you were lying.

				LEE
		I'm sorry.

				CARTER
		Damn it, why are you ruining my night? 
		I'm just starting to have fun.
			(beat)
		Well fine then, go ahead, pull your
		badge and do your thing.

				LEE
		No, we're here for information, to find
		out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We
		must tread softly and keep our ears
		open.

				CARTER
		Tread softly?  Who taught you how to
		roost a bar?

				LEE
		Carter, you don't understand.  These men
		are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the
		most deadly gang in China.

				CARTER
		Man, are you crazy?  You think that
		scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented
		gangs.  We were having gang wars before
		anybody even thought about it.  We get
		royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme
		your badge and gun and I'll show you how
		it's done.

				LEE
		No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am
		Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.

				CARTER
		You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner
		last night.

	Before Lee can react, Carter has lifted Lee's badge and gun. 
	Carter bounds back on stage, pulls the plug on the music and
	fires three SHOTS into the ceiling, silencing the bar.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
			(Chinese)
		Deng wa lu yun, shen wu wattu masu wang
		lui.

	Nobody moves.  Strange looks from the crowd.  Carter turns to
	Lee.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
			(whispering)
		What'd I say?

				LEE
		You just said you're their worst
		nightmare - and to line their mothers up
		for a milking.

				CARTER
		Shit.  C'mon, get up here and help me
		out.

	Reluctantly, Lee gets on stage.  More looks from the Chinese
	as Carter speaks, Lee translating.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Okay, all the Triads and ugly women go
		to that side, all fine ass women on this
		side.

	Nobody moves.  Carter fires two more shots in the ceiling.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Let's try this again.  Who here knows
		Ricky Tan, raise your hand.

	Nobody moves.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Who here is named Lee?  Raise your hand.

	Nobody moves.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Now I know you're lying.  

	The crowd still hasn't moved.  Except in the back, where Lee
	spots several GANGSTERS leaving.  As Lee runs off stage --

				CARTER (CONT'D)
			(as they run out)
		I come back and catch y'all singing
		Michael Jackson and you're all going to
		jail.

	EXT. RAVEN CLUB - NIGHT

	Lee and Carter run into the street, just in time to see HU LI
	and several gangsters round a corner.

				CARTER
		Stop!  LAPD!

	Lee takes off and chases them on foot.

	EXT. HONG KONG STREET - NIGHT

	EXT. HONG KONG STREET - NIGHT

	The far end of the street is BLOCKED BY MARKET STALLS.  The
	GANGSTERS look around frantically.  An apartment building is
	under CONSTRUCTION, massive BAMBOO SCAFFOLDING top to bottom. 
	Their only way out is UP.

	Lee and Carter dash around the corner to see the gangsters
	SWARMING UP THE SCAFFOLDING.  Lee wastes no time going after
	them.  With a running start, he JAMS A FOOT on the wall and
	VAULTS to the BOTTOM RUNG, GRABS HOLD AND SWINGS UP.

				CARTER
		Hang on, Lee.  I'm coming.

	Carter jumps to grab hold of the scaffolding.  NOT EVEN
	CLOSE.  He backs up -- he's gonna take a running start!

	ABOVE - LEE REACHES 4 GANGSTERS.  They all tear off the
	LENGTHS OF BAMBOO and square off.  The clatter of wood
	against wood as they beat at each other.  Wrestling over his
	pole, Lee FLINGS TWO of the GANGSTERS over the edge.

	BELOW, Carter has hold of the bottom rung, STRAINING MIGHTILY
	to pull himself up.  Just as he gets his chin above the
	bar... snap!  It BREAKS and he drops.  Then...

	WHAM!  WHAM!  The two gangsters CRASH LAND ON EITHER side of
	CARTER.  HE takes one look at their pain.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Forget this...

	He dashes into the stairwell.  ABOVE, the last two GANGSTERS
	come at Lee.  He stomps down, levering up floor boards, which
	SEE-SAWS them off-balance.  With the advantage, he BATTERS
	them with his bamboo pole and knocks them off.  He climbs
	after the GANGSTER LEADER.

	ON HU LI and the GANGSTERS

	Coming over the crest of the hill, seeing Carter climbing up
	the hill.

	EXT. ROOF - CONTINUOUS

	Lee pulls himself up onto the roof, takes a few steps when
	WHAM!  He is clocked by a 16-foot BAMBOO POLE.  Lee TOPPLES
	OVER THE EDGE!  We see his adversary for the first time.

	HU LI - AGILE, GORGEOUS...DANGEROUS

	As she steps to the edge... BOOM!  The STAIRWELL DOOR FLIES
	OPEN and CARTER EMERGES.  Gun low and ready.  Hu Li is gone.

				CARTER
			(out of breath)
		Freeze!  Nobody move!

	Carter goes to the edge and sees Lee hanging on a pole below. 
	Carter is blind-sided by Hu Li.

	She takes one sultry step towards him, then twists her heel
	and WINDMILLS a HARD KICK that sends Carter FLYING OFF THE
	ROOF!

	He falls along the side of the building.  He manages to grab
	the end of a BAMBOO POLE that juts out from the scaffolding.

	LEE IS RIGHT THERE NEXT TO HIM!

	They're hanging side-by-side, holding on for their lives.  Hu
	Li looks down at them.  She has no weapon to finish them off. 
	She turns and runs, disappearing in the night.

	CARTER AND LEE

	holding on with all their strength.  The bamboo is starting
	to bend.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		All I wanted was a little mu-shu.

				LEE
		Try to land on your feet.

	Carter looks down at a rancid dumpster below them.

				CARTER
		I can't believe I flew ten-thousand
		miles for this shit.

	The POLE BREAKS
			
	SUPER THE TITLE:

	RUSH HOUR 2: REMEMBER THE DRAGON

	INT. LEE'S UNMARKED POLICE CAR - LATER THAT NIGHT

	Carter and Lee drive through Hong Kong, the two men riding in
	silence, bruised and covered in garbage.

				CARTER
		You lied to me. 

				LEE
		I'm sorry.

				CARTER
		You're sorry.  I got somebody's old
		chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't
		tell me you're sorry.  Just take me
		home.

				LEE
		No time.  There was an explosion at the
		American Embassy today -- two American
		translators were killed.

	Carter takes this in.  Can't believe his own bad luck.

				CARTER
		So that Ricky Tan, he's the one who blew
		up the Embassy?

	EXT. MONASTERY SCHOOL - EARLY MORNING

	Lee and Carter walk into a massive COURTYARD, where thirty 12
	year olds are going through their warm up routines.  

	MASTER FU, 60's, wears a BLACK ROBE as he teaches his kids.

				CARTER
		I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of
		this shit.  There's two billion Chinese -
		let one of them be your partner.

				LEE
		This won't take long. 

	Master Fu barks out a barrage of SHAOLIN FIGHTING STANCES.

				MASTER FU
		Dragon kick!

	Like well-trained army, the students YELL AND KICK HARD.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D)
		Lotus block!

	The students YELL and form an "X" with their arms.  Master Fu
	notices Carter and Lee watching from the back.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D)
		Twisting Tiger!

	No response.  The students exchange baffled looks.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D (CONT'D)
			(staring straight at Lee)
		Twisting Tiger!

	Lee may be a big rusty, but he puts on a shit-kicking move
	that leaves the students blown away.  Lee smiles, basking in
	the glow...

	...until he sees Master Fu's disappointment.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D)
		Didn't I teach you to always arch your
		back?

				LEE
			(bowing, humbled)
		Yes, Master.

	While Lee follows Master Fu, Carter stands in front of the 12
	YEAR OLDS, who sit motionless around a fighting circle. 

	Carter starts stretching his legs, warming up.

				CARTER
		I was watching you kids.  My name is
		Carter, LAPD, and I'm a third degree
		black belt.  At least that's what I tell
		the girls at the Holiday Health Spa
		where I work out.

	Carter throws a series of QUICK PUNCHES, but the kids have no
	reaction.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Let me give you kids some tips.  The key
		to Kung Fu is the follow through.  Why
		don't you stand up.

	THE KIDS DON'T MOVE, no reaction.  Carter continues to throw
	punches.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Go ahead, kick me, hit me.  I'll show
		you how to block.  Come on, stand up,
		give me your best shot -- try to kick
		right to my head.

	The kids still don't move.  Carter, working up a sweat from
	shadow fighting, takes off his JACKET, DRAPING IT over the
	HOLY BUDDHA behind him -- a mistake.  He swings back around
	to face the kids and NEVER SEES THE KICK that sends him
	flying back onto the mat.  He looks around and sees ALL of
	the kids STANDING, in FIGHTING POSITION.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		That's pretty good.  Which one of you
		kids did that?

	INT. COURTYARD PATHWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Master Fu walking.

				LEE
		I need your help, Master.  I'm seeking a
		man who used to train with you.  He's
		become a killer - the worst kind of
		animal.

				MASTER FU
		Animals kill only from hunger or fear. 
		The man you seek is lower than a
		serpent.  
			(faces Lee)
		...he kills for money.

	In the b.g., we see the kids leaping acrobatically over
	Carter from all sides.  Carter, frustrated, tries to grab the
	kids out of the air as they fly by, but they elude him.  They
	disappear O.S.

	Lee and Master Fu walk another moment, Master Fu lost in
	thought.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D)
		He was the best I ever trained, you
		know.

				LEE
		Ricky Tan?

				MASTER FU
		No.  Your father.
			(Lee reacts)
		Your father and Ricky Tan were my
		favorite students... and for such awful
		things to happen as they did --

	Lee cuts off Master Fu's reminisces -- he's obviously
	uncomfortable.

				LEE
		How do I find Ricky Tan?

	AGAIN IN THE B.G., Carter and the flying kids go zipping by
	in the other direction, disappear O.S.

	Master Fu pats the SOIL around a struggling plant.

				MASTER FU
		A seeding spends its entire life
		reaching towards Heaven.

				LEE
		I know, Master, but...

				MASTER FU
		The answers you seek can be found in
		Heaven on Earth.

				LEE
		Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't
		understand.
			(working it)
		A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A
		mountain, where Earth reaches for the --

				MASTER FU
		It's a massage parlor downtown.  "Heaven
		on Earth."  You will find your answers
		there.

	Lee bows to Master Fu, slowly turns to walk back down the
	pathway.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D)
		Wait!  Put a c-note in the jar.

	Lee puts a few bills in the jar, heads down a pathway. 
	Master Fu walks over and takes the cash.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D)
		Cheap bastard...

	EXT. MONASTERY SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

	Lee emerges from the path, stops when he sees Carter -- two
	students headlocked under each arm, another two scissor
	locked between his legs, holding another two down with his
	hands, and sitting on the last one.

				CARTER
		And that's how you use the LAPD choke
		hold.  Now start practicing and don't
		make me come back here!

				LEE
		Carter...you ready to have some fun!?

	EXT. HEAVEN ON EARTH MASSAGE PARLOR - DAY

	A neon light hangs above the upscale massage parlor.

				LEE
		Just follow my lead and act like a
		tourist.

				CARTER
		I am a tourist.

	INT. HEAVEN ON EARTH MASSAGE PARLOR - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter walk into an upscale MASSAGE PARLOR and stand
	in a lobby.  SOFT MUSIC is playing. 

				HOSTESS
		Good afternoon, gentlemen.

	Lee bows, followed by Carter.

				LEE
			(in Chinese)
		Hello.

				CARTER
		How you doin'?

				LEE
		My friend is on vacation, from America. 
		I want to show him a good time.

				HOSTESS
		Oh, you American?

				CARTER
		That's right.

				HOSTESS
		You bring American money?

				CARTER
			(holding up a Platinum AmEx)
		Never leave home without it.
			(to Lee)
		Lee, this one's on me.  You save your
		money.

	The Hostess takes Carter by the arm, walks over to a HIDDEN
	SLIDING DOOR - slides it open to reveal TWENTY BEAUTIFUL
	WOMEN.  Carter truly is in Heaven.

				HOSTESS
		You get massage from Chinese girl
		before?

				CARTER
		No.  It's my first time.

				HOSTESS
		You pick any girl for you and your
		friend.

	Carter looks like a kid in a candy store.

				CARTER
		Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that
		one.

				HOSTESS
		Oh yes, she's very nice.

				CARTER
		She is nice.  But I am very tense.  I'm
		gonna need a lot of massages.  I'll take
		that one, too.  How you doin', baby? 
		And...that one in pink.  She can do my
		feet.

	Lee elbows Carter.

				LEE
		What are you doing?

				CARTER
		She said I could pick any girl I want.

				LEE
		Well, hurry up.

				CARTER
		Hey!  You don't break in front of a
		black man in a buffet line.

				HOSTESS
			(to Lee)
		Your friend have big appetite.
			(handing ROBES to Lee and
			 Carter)
		Please put these on and wait upstairs in
		the quiet room.

	INT. QUIET ROOM MASSAGE PARLOR - DAY

	TWENTY MEN in SILK ROBES lie in reclining chairs, women
	massaging their feet and hands.  There are BIG SCREEN TV's
	showing nature films, relaxation music playing in the
	background. 

	Lee and Carter sit in the quiet room dressed in MATCHING
	PURPLE ROBES.  Lee wears SLIPPERS, Carter wears his HIGH
	TOPS.  Carter is enjoying a hand and neck massage at the same
	time.  A WOMAN walks over and hands them each a drink.

				CARTER
		Now I'm on vacation.  I knew you'd come
		through, Lee.

	LEE doesn't respond.  LEE IS STARING AT SOMEONE ON THE FAR
	SIDE OF THE ROOM.  A man who radiates a unique blend of
	sophistication and brutality.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		What's wrong?

				LEE
		Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.

				CARTER
		That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. 
		I'll go over with you right now, shake
		him down.

				LEE
		This is a very dangerous man.

				CARTER
		I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna
		ruin my massage because of some midget
		in a house coat.

				LEE
		I'm calling for back up!

	Lee gets up from a chair, hurriedly exits.

	Carter looks at RICKY TAN -- sitting quietly in his chair
	with his LAPTOP COMPUTER on his knees.  Carter makes a
	decision, gets up and walks towards him.

				CARTER
		Ricky Tan, I've been looking all over
		for you.  Get up.

	Tan looks up for a moment, a smile.

				RICKY TAN
		I'm busy at the moment.

				CARTER
		I said get on your feet!

				RICKY TAN
		I know you, Detective Carter, right? 
		You're Lee's American friend.  Enjoying
		your visit?

				CARTER
		I'm Lee's new muscle, his right arm --
		and don't let the robe fool you.  This
		is the only color they had left.  Now
		get up!

	Tan laughs, goes back to his laptop.  CARTER GRABS THE LAPTOP
	from Ricky and throws it across the room - SHATTERING IT
	against the wall.  Ricky glances at his men who are seated
	around the room waiting to move.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		I told you to get on your feet!

	Having heard the commotion, Lee arrives by Carter's side,
	breathless, as Tan looks up, surprised.

				RICKY TAN
		Lee, I've missed you, brother.
			(getting up, giving Lee a hug)
		I heard about the two Americans, I'm so
		sorry, you must be under great pressure.

				LEE
		You must come with me for questioning.

				CARTER
		Let's go.  I've got girls and chicken
		and hot oil waiting for me.

				RICKY TAN
		I don't think so...

	A nod of Ricky Tan's head, and TEN LARGE MEN in robes and
	towels spring out of reclining chairs -- menacingly facing
	Lee and Carter.  A beat...

				CARTER
		I'd like to pay you for that laptop.

				RICKY TAN
		It's no problem.  But I must excuse
		myself, inspector.

				CARTER
		That's Chief Inspector, he got promoted.

	Tan bows to Lee and Carter.

				RICKY TAN
		Congratulations.  And good day.

	As Tan starts to exit, Lee and Carter move to intercept him. 
	But they are blocked by TAN'S MEN.

	Lee grabs one of the men's towels and pulls it off.  The man
	covers his naked body.  Lee is grabbed by one of the other
	henchmen, but he escapes and begins kicking ass, using the
	towel and his own robe to block and wrap another man's arms --
	blocking, kicking, and punching everything in sight -- all
	the while managing to keep his privates covered with a towel,
	his robe, or some other found object.

	Carter, meanwhile, uses his quick hands to send several men
	flying back -- grabbing a towel of one of them.

				CARTER
			(ref: his privates)
		Damn!  No wonder you're pissed off.

	Carter uses the towel like Lee did to block and trap one of
	the men's punches.

	In the middle of fighting, Lee is suddenly exposed -- he
	flinches to cover himself and is punched from behind. 
	Momentarily stunned, he's lifted from behind -- two men
	throwing him out the front door.

	Carter is also overpowered by two men, who lift him over
	their shoulders.

	EXT. HONG KONG HIGHWAY - DAY

	Ricky Tan's black limo SCREECHES to a stop.  The door flies
	open and Lee and Carter are TOSSED out onto the highway. 
	Both men are completely naked.

	EXT. HONG KONG POLICE STATION - DAY

	A packed street - Lee and Carter dodging in and out of
	people.  The CAMERA PANS and we see Lee and Carter from
	behind.

				CARTER
		Goddamn you got a small ass.

				LEE
		Don't look at my ass!

	INT. HONG KONG POLICE STATION - BULLPEN - DAY

	PANDEMONIUM

	The station is packed with Americans -- FBI AGENTS, SECRET
	SERVICE... they've set up shop right in the middle of the
	bullpen.

	SUPERINDENDENT CHIN is arguing with SPECIAL AGENT STERLING, a
	50-year old hard ass who is in charge of this circus.

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		Chin, you have been ordered by the
		Ministry of Public Security to assist
		the FBI and Secret Service with our
		investigation, to provide us with
		whatever we need.  If you have
		information, it belongs to us.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		This is still Hong Kong.

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		Two Americans have been killed on United
		States Government property -- this is
		our investigation.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		Chief Inspector Lee will brief your
		people...

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		No.  He will report to me.  Do we
		understand each other?

	SUDDENLY ALL EYES turn as Carter and Lee enter the bullpen. 
	Out of breath, still robed: Lee covering himself with a trash
	can lid, Carter using a red construction cone.

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING (CONT'D)
		Who the hell is that?

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
			(humiliated)
		That is...Chief Inspector Lee.  The
		detective in charge of our
		investigation.

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		Put a diaper on him, Chin.  I want to
		talk to the great Inspector Lee.

	INT. LEE'S OFFICE - DAY

	The shades are down as Lee frantically gets dressed, putting
	on a suit and fixing his tie. 
	Carter finishes putting on a BLACK CHINESE STYLE SUIT from
	Lee's closet, then moves for the door.

				LEE
		Where are you going?

				CARTER
		Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn
		passport back.  I'm going home.

				LEE
		Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.

				CARTER
		Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up,
		so I backed you up.  I was about to take
		out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.

				LEE
		Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit!

				CARTER
		My bullshit?  I'm not the one who goes
		to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! 
		I'm not the one who goes to massage
		parlors to bust crime lords!

				LEE
		It's my job!

				CARTER
		You're pathetic, man.  When's the last
		time you had some fun?  When's the last
		time you took a night off, had a date?

				LEE
		I have plenty of dates.

				CARTER
		Really?  When's the last time you had
		some Mu-shu  Let's hear it, Lee, when
		was it?  Year of the rat?

				LEE
		You would never understand my life. 
		You're not Chinese.

				CARTER
		And you ain't black!

	The two men look at each other for a long BEAT.  Lee quickly
	walks out, slamming the door behind him, leaving Carter half
	dressed.

	INT. SUPERINDENDENT CHIN'S OFFICE - DAY

	Lee walks in, sees Sterling sitting at Chin's desk.  Chin
	stands in the back.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from
		the United States Secret Service.

				LEE
		The Secret Service?  Why?

				STERLING
		What I'm about to tell you cannot leave
		this room.  The men who were killed
		yesterday were not American translators. 
		They were undercover U.S. customs agents
		trying to break a Triad smuggling ring. 
		We don't know what they're transporting
		out of Hong Kong, but whatever it is, it
		got the agents killed.

				LEE
		How can we help?

				STERLING
		Stay the hell out of our way.

				LEE
		I can get to Ricky Tan.

				STERLING
		We know all about Tan.  That's why we're
		leaving him out there as bait.  We think
		this is a lot bigger than just Ricky Tan
		and his Fu-Cang-Long Triads.

	INT. LEE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

	Carter is on the phone, his feet on Lee's desk.  As he talks
	he opens a drawer, pulls out a wad of cash and pockets it.

				CARTER
		Captain, you're gonna have to speak up. 
		I'm on a car phone!

	INT. CAPTAIN DIEL'S OFFICE - LAPD HEADQUARTERS - DAY

	CAPTAIN DIEL sits behind his desk talking on the phone.

				CAPTAIN DIEL
		Is it true, Carter?  Are you in Hong
		Kong right now?

				CARTER
		Hong Kong?  I'm not in Hong Kong.  I'm
		in Hollywood -- right at Sunset and
		Vine, two minutes from the station.  How
		about I pick you up right now and take
		you to dinner?

				CAPTAIN DIEL
		It's nine-thirty in the morning.

				CARTER
		Did I say dinner?  I meant diner. 
		Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.

				CAPTAIN DIEL
		Do you know what happened yesterday,
		Carter?  I was officially nominated for
		the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. 
		There was a dinner last night, two
		hundred LAPD officers were there.

				CARTER
		Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez
		there?  He owes me money.

				CAPTAIN DIEL
		I've waited my whole life for this job,
		but I don't have a shot in hell of
		getting it.  Do you know why?

				CARTER
		Is it because of the hookers, sir?  You
		tell them there's no crime in being
		lonely.

				CAPTAIN DIEL
		No, Carter.  The reason I'm screwed is
		because the entire department is about
		to find out the stolen credit cards we
		impounded were used to buy two first
		class upgrades to Hong Kong.  And what
		the hell is Heaven on Earth?

				CARTER
		Sir, I'm working on a big case over here
		-- and by the time I get back they're
		gonna make you Governor.  Captain, you
		there?  Hello?  Shit!

	As Carter walks out the DOOR, he brushes past HU LI, who is
	standing in the hallway disguised as a FED EX DELIVERY
	PERSON.  Carter checks her out as he exits.

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	CARTER starts walking down the street, making his way past an
	outdoor BUTCHER MARKET, getting strange looks from locals and
	tourists alike.  He motions to an OLD WOMAN who is selling
	LIVE DUCKS, PIGEONS AND CHICKENS

				CARTER
		How you doing?  Can you direct me to the
		Heaven on Earth massage parlor?  

	The OLD WOMAN stares at Carter, starts motioning to her CAGES
	filled with birds.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		No, I don't eat live birds.  I like my
		birds dead and deep fried.  You ever
		been to Popeyes?

	The Woman takes out a bird, holds up a HATCHET.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		No, don't do that, I had a big lunch. 
		I'm warning you, I'm a police officer --
		just put the blade down and let the bird
		go.

	INT. HONG KONG POLICE STATION - BULLPEN/LEE'S OFFICE - DAY

	Lee walks out of the Captain's office, heads for his own
	office - but never gets there.

	AN EXPLOSION rips through the second floor of the station. 
	Lee diving for safety as glass and debris shoot over his
	head.  Sheer pandemonium as Lee quickly looks up at his
	destroyed office, tries to get to his feet.

	STUNNED POLICE OFFICERS and DETECTIVES are crowded around
	Lee's office, looking at the rubble.  Lee pushes through the
	crowd -- it's all smoke and fire.  Now way anyone held back
	by the heat.

				LEE
		Carter!  CARTER!

	EXT. HONG KONG STREET - DAY

	Carter walks down the street holding a CAGE WITH A LIVE RED
	BIRD inside.  He stops a MAN who is sweeping in front of his
	store.

				CARTER
		How you doing?  I'm looking for Heaven
		on Earth.

	The man stares at Carter, watches as he pulls out his:

	ENGLISH/CHINESE DICTIONARY

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Shan-shui cao guo-jiu, pao gai niu tao
		zi.

				MAN
		You wish to spank my sister with a ping
		pong paddle?

				CARTER
		No man, I was just asking...

				MAN
		Wait here.  I'll go see if she's awake.

	As the man walks into his store, Carter runs off.

	Pause.

	Carter strolls back INTO FRAME, peering into the store to see
	if it's worth staying...

	INT. HONG KONG POLICE STATION - BULL PEN - DAY

	Lee sits by himself in shock.  Superindendent Chin
	approaches.

				LEE
		All he wanted was some mu-shu.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		Are you okay, Lee?

	Beat.

				LEE
		I'm sorry, I have to go.

	EXT. HEAVEN ON EARTH MASSAGE PARLOR - AFTERNOON

	Carter finally makes his way to the massage parlor, moving
	for the FRONT DOOR when he sees RICKY TAN EXIT.  Carter ducks
	to the side and watches as Ricky climbs into the back of a
	waiting Daimler.

	The Daimler drives off.  Carter rushes to the middle of the
	street with a determined look on his face.

				CARTER
		I'm gonna solve this case myself.  Taxi!

	Carter flags down a CAB, jumps in the back seat.

	INT. TAXI - EVENING

	The CAB DRIVER turns to Carter, who motions to the limo.

				CARTER
			(loud)
		Follow that limo.

	The Cab Driver continues to stare at Carter.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		You understand what I'm saying?  Follow
		that car!  Where it goes, you go!  This
		is a chase -- we are chasing that limo!
			(beat)
		We are still parked -- we're not moving! 
		This is the opposite of chasing -- drive
		the car or I will kill you!

	The driver slowly turns, holding out his hand.  Carter fishes
	in his pocket hands the cab driver a wad of cash.

				CAB DRIVER
		Now you speak my language.
			
	INT. LEE'S CAR - DAY

	Lee drives, misty-eyed.  RAP MUSIC playing over the stereo. 
	Lee turns it up, slowly moving his head to the music, in
	tribute to Carter.

	His CELL PHONE rings, he turns down the music.

	INTERCUT -- 

	INT. CHIN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		Lee, we just got a call from the harbor
		patrol.  Ricky Tan is throwing a little
		party on his boat tonight.  Victoria
		harbor.  If you don't want to...

				LEE
		Did you tell Sterling?

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		Let him find out on his own.  I want the
		Hong Kong police handling this.

				LEE
		Thank you.

	Lee hangs up.  A look of intensity.  He CRANKS the RAP MUSIC
	up, a man on a mission.

	EXT. YACHT - HARBOR - NIGHT

	A 190-FOOT YACHT is anchored in Victoria Harbor.  Ricky Tan
	walks along the top deck with HU LI, disappearing into a
	crowd of people who are partying on the ship.

	Carter steps out of the cab.

				CARTER
		Stay here.  I'll be right back.  You
		understand?

				CAB DRIVER
		Yes.  I understand.

	Carter steps out of the cab, which immediately drives off,
	leaving him alone on the docks.

	Carter looks around the dock -- a pull up valet station
	parking fancy cars, RICH PEOPLE getting on the boat as their
	names are checked off a list by two DOORMEN.

	INT. YACHT - NIGHT

	A huge PARTY, a live band plays for a crowd of business men,
	politicians and beautiful women - a who's who of Hong Kong.

	CARTER walks up to the front of the boat -- TWO DOORMEN
	HOLDING clipboards immediately stop him.

				DOORMAN #1
		Invitation, please.

				CARTER
		I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.

				DOORMAN #1
		The band has been playing over an hour.

				CARTER
		I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo. 
		Ricky here yet, I need to get his
		requests.

	As Carter walks past the doorman -- 

				DOORMAN #1
		Wait.

				CARTER
		Last party all he wanted was Sting --
		not one person danced.  Tonight I'm
		doing Superfreak, I don't care what he
		says.  Where is he?

				DOORMAN #1
		Mr. Tan is not to be disturbed by the
		help.

	Carter turns back to the doorman, grabs him by the collar.

				CARTER
		Help?  I'm not the help, man -- I'm the
		star.  That's my band up there -- I
		control the mood, the groove, the
		atmosphere.

	Carter cuts a smoking DANCE MOVE.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Can you do that?
			(man shakes head "no")
		That's why you're down here and I'm up
		there.  Now this is my party -- don't
		forget it!

	Carter walks onto the ship, starts singing to himself.

	EXT. YACHT - HARBOR - CONTINUOUS

	The SHIP'S HORN SOUNDS, the yacht starts to head out to sea. 
	Lee steps out of his car, sees the yacht is pulling out of
	the slip.  He runs along the side of the boat, has no choice
	but to jump from the end of the pier, landing hard on the
	side of the ship, somehow holding onto a PORTHOLE WINDOW.  He
	clings to the yacht, then throws himself toward a hanging
	LIFEBOAT, climbs up the side and jumps toward the TOP RAIL --

	EXT. YACHT - CONTINUOUS

	As Carter walks through the ship, he grabs a handful of food
	from a waiter, his eyes searching the crowd, rounds a corner 
	- almost stepping right into HU LI, who's approaching STEVEN
	REIGN.  Steven Reign is in his 50's -- perfectly groomed,
	impeccably dressed - his looks and bearing say one thing --
	money. 
	He's got the big party smile on, but as Hu Li arrives,
	Reign's face shifts and his eyes go dead -- the billionaire
	as sociopath.

	Carter steps back, but sees Reign Whisper to Hu Li.  Carter
	hides and turns away as Hu Li instinctively scans the room
	for signs of trouble.  He heads into the main party.

	Carter stops walking when he comes upon ISABELLA MOLINA, a
	stunning brunette, sitting at the bar drinking a glass of
	champagne.  Carter lights her cigarette for her.

				CARTER
		How you doing, baby?  My name is Prince
		Mubutu from Nigeria.

				ISABELLA
		Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That
		seat is taken.

				CARTER
			(in mangled Spanish)
		San Juan!  You must know my good friend
		Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector
		Elizondo.

				ISABELLA
			(in English)
		I don't think so.

				CARTER
		I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled
		in the best circles.  But hey, I
		understand.  Make yourself at home,
		Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever
		you want.  My ship is your ship.

				ISABELLA
		This is your ship?

				CARTER
		That's right.  I'm the owner, the
		Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.

				ISABELLA
		El Capitan?

				CARTER
		I don't want to play games with you,
		Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself
		with you -- in one of those bathrooms
		over there in about five minutes.

				ISABELLA
		Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a
		beautiful yacht.  What's it called?

				CARTER
		Called?  What's my ship called?
			(he has no idea)
		Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow
		Johnson.

				ISABELLA
		The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name
		on the back was "Red Dragon."

				CARTER
		Red Dragon?  You sure about that?

				ISABELLA
		I'm sure, because this is my friend's
		yacht.  And it's his party.

				CARTER
		Your friend's ship?
			(looking around)
		Oh, man.  I must've walked onto the
		wrong yacht.  I knew there was a reason
		my keys didn't work.

				STEVEN REIGN
			(taking seat next to Isabella)
		Who's your friend?

				ISABELLA
		Somebody who got on the wrong yacht.

				CARTER
		Wait a second.  You're Steven Reign? 
		You're big time.  You own all them big
		hotels.  What are you doing in Hong
		Kong?

				STEVEN REIGN
			(ushering away Isabella)
		I'm just in town for the weekend, taking
		in the sights.

				ISABELLA
		Enjoy the party, Mr. Carter.

	Carter nods, waves.  Steven Reign and Isabella walk away. 
	Carter's watching.

	INT. SHIP'S HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Lee makes his way toward a STAIRCASE that is blocked by a
	BODYGUARD.  He quickly disarms the guard and grabs him by the
	throat, pushing him against the wall.

				LEE
		Ricky Tan.  Where is he?

				BODYGUARD #1
		Who's asking?

				LEE
		The Hong Kong Police.  He killed a
		detective today and he's not getting
		away with it.  Now where is he?

				CARTER
		Yeah.  Tell us!  And don't play games or
		we'll kick your lying ass!

	Lee slowly turns around and looks at Carter, who is standing
	right behind him.

				LEE
		Carter?

				CARTER
		Who died?

				LEE
		You.

				CARTER
		Detective Yu?  Never met him.

				LEE
		Not Yu.  You!

				CARTER
		Who?

				LEE
		Do you understand the words that are
		coming out of my mouth?

				CARTER
		Nobody understands the words that are
		coming out of your mouth.

				BODYGUARD #1
		Get your hands in the air.

	Lee and Carter turn to see FOUR BODYGUARDS standing in front
	of them with GUNS in hand.

				BODYGUARD #1 (CONT'D)
		Ricky Tan is expecting you.
			
			INT. RICKY TAN'S YACHT - MAIN CABIN - NIGHT

	It looks like HUGH HEFNER'S BEDROOM complete with ROUND BED
	and SUNKEN BAR.  Ricky Tan sits in front of a big screen
	satellite TV screaming at the Lakers.  Hu Li opens the door
	and the bodyguards lead Lee into the bedroom.

				RICKY TAN
		Come on, Shaq, hit a damn free-throw! 
		You can do it, big guy.

	ON TV

	We see Shaq miss his free throw.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
		Shit!  He still doesn't follow through. 
		I just lost five grand.

	Tan turns off the TV, turns to Lee.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
		Why don't we go on the deck, get some
		air...and some privacy.
			(to Hu Li)
		Leave us alone.

	Hu Li hesitates, upset at being dismissed.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
			(to Lee)
		Could you have your partner wait for us
		outside?

				CARTER
		I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist.  I
		got proof.  See, I got a mini-bar key.

				LEE
			(to Carter)
		I'll meet you on the main deck in ten
		minutes.

	Carter pulls Lee aside.

				CARTER
		What, leave you alone so he can cap you?

				LEE
		I'm okay, you go.

				CARTER
		Why the hell should you believe him?  He
		had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty
		shit.

				LEE
		Remember I told you my father was a
		policeman?
			(beat)
		Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.

				CARTER
			(pause)
		What the hell is going on here?

	No answer.  Carter holds Lee's glance for a beat, then turns
	and walks the other way.

	EXT. RICKY TAN'S YACHT - UPPER DECK - NIGHT

	Tan and Lee reach the upper deck, where they are alone.

				RICKY TAN
		Despite what people suspect...what you
		suspect --

				LEE
		Don't.

	Ricky Tan hears the steel in Lee's voice, acknowledges it.

				RICKY TAN
		... if your father were alive, I would
		be turning to him now.
			(beat)
		I didn't blow up the American Embassy,
		but I believe some of my people did.  My
		enemies are trying to frame me.
			(beat)
		There is a war going on within the
		Triads -- and I am going to lose.  My
		name has been written into the book of
		death.

				LEE
		The police can protect you.

				RICKY TAN
		Nobody can protect me.  I'll make a deal
		with you, Lee.  But only iff you'll get
		me out of Hong Kong.

				LEE
		Tell me why they killed the customs
		agents.

				RICKY TAN
		There is a ship, in the Hong Kong
		Harbor...

	Hu Li BURSTS onto the deck, flanked by FOUR BODYGUARDS.

	Ricky Tan screams something at Hu Li in Chinese.  Hu Li
	screams back as SHE EMPTIES HER GUN INTO RICKY'S CHEST.  Tan
	falls back, over the rail, and into the water.

	Lee MOVES TOWARDS HU LI, but the four bodyguards are on Lee,
	attacking from all sides.  Hu Li exits as Lee tries to fight
	off the bodyguards.

	INT. RICKY TAN'S YACHT - MAIN CABIN - NIGHT

	Reactions from the crowd as GUNSHOTS echo from the deck
	above.

	INT. SHIP'S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Hu Li moves quickly down the hallway, rounding a corner and
	suddenly goes FLYING, landing flat on her face.

	It's Carter, who ran to the sound of the gunshot, and TRIPPED
	Hu Li with his leg.

				CARTER
		All right, get your hands up.

	Hu Li backflips up -- kicking Carter in the head.

	EXT. UPPER DECK - CONTINUOUS

	Lee takes down Bodyguard #1, but is still fighting three on
	one.  A furious exchange of acrobatic blows between Lee and
	Bodyguard #2.

	INT. SHIP'S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Carter and Hu Li face off.

				CARTER
		You wanna piece of me?  C'mon, I'll give
		you a little LAPD ass kickin'.

	Hu Li savages Carter with a series of punishing blows.

	INT. UPPER DECK - CONTINUOUS

	Lee manages to defeat Bodyguards #3 and #4.  As he catches
	his breath the sound of a SPEED BOAT starting its engines.

				LEE
		Hu Li!

	Lee runs to the rail -- looks down to see a SPEEDBOAT
	starting to pull away from the ship.  Hu Li jumps onboard the
	moving boat.

	Lee starts to turn for the stairs, running down towards the
	stern.
			
	EXT. YACHT - STERN - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter run up to the stern at the same time --
	watching helplessly as Hu Li gets away in the speed boat.

	Carter turns his head, sees --

	-- STEVEN REIGN at the other end of the boat, watching Hu Li
	escape, not at all behaving like a panicky billionaire should
	during a gangland shooting.  Wordlessly, Reign disappears
	back into the shadows.

	EXT. DOCK - NIGHT

	The yacht is anchored.  A few TRIADS led away in handcuffs. 
	Thrown into PATROL CARS that have surrounded the docks.

	Sterling, Chin, Lee and Carter on the dock.

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		Quite a night, Inspector.  Ricky Tan was
		our only bait, and now he's gone.  You
		finally got your revenge - at the
		expense of a U.S. Government
		investigation.

				CARTER
		What "revenge" is he talking about?

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid
		you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was
		a pure vendetta killing -- but you're
		off this case.  I don't ever want to see
		you again, you got that?

				CARTER
		Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are
		you --

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going
		back to L.A.

				CARTER
		Fine with me.

	Sterling walks away disgusted.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		I'm sorry Lee, but my orders are to
		fully cooperate with the Secret Service.

	Lee nods a respectful but bitter acknowledgment.  Chin
	motions for two uniformed Hong Kong police officers to
	approach.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN (CONT'D)
			(to police officers)
		Escort Detective Carter to the airport --

				LEE
		I'll take him.

				CARTER
		Hell no.

	The Hong Kong police officers produce HANDCUFFS.  Beat.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
			(to Lee)
		Fine.  But don't expect me to talk to
		you.

	Carter stalks off.

				LEE
		Don't push me, Carter.  I'm in no mood
		for your bullshit.

	Carter gets in Lee's face.  The two men look like they're
	about to come to blows.

				CARTER
		What are you gonna do about it,
		grasshopper?

				LEE
		I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.

				CARTER
		Give me your best shot, you flat assed
		mama's boy.

				LEE
		Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my
		ass!

				CARTER
		I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.

				LEE
		No.  She's a school teacher.

				CARTER
		You're not very good at this, are you?

				LEE
		Good at what?   

				CARTER
		Forget it.

	A long beat while Lee considers what to say.

				LEE
		Five years ago, my father was Chief
		Inspector working a big international
		smuggling case.

				CARTER
		Ask me if I give a shit.

	Lee waits a beat, then drops the bombshell.

				LEE
		Ricky Tan killed my father.

	Carter is suddenly all ears, listening intently now to Lee.

				LEE (CONT'D)
		He found out his partner, Tan, had been
		working for the Triads all along.
			(beat)
		Before my father could prove it, he was
		killed in the line of duty.

				CARTER
		How the hell did Tan get away with it?

				LEE
		All the evidence against him
		disappeared, the smuggling case was
		unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to
		the Triads openly.

				CARTER
			(pause)
		This is about your Daddy's death?  Hell,
		Lee, you know my father died on the job. 
		You could have told me...
			(realizing)
		This is about more than all that, isn't
		it?  This is about your Daddy's last
		case, right?

	Lee's caught, fibs badly.

				LEE
		No, no, that would be crazy --

				CARTER
		You thought the "Customs Agents get
		blown up" and "smuggling" and "Ricky
		Tan" and you put it all together and
		came up with a five year old case. 
		That's why you didn't tell me what we
		were doing...

				LEE
		I thought you'd think it was crazy.

				CARTER
		IT IS CRAZY!

				LEE
		I know.  I know.  I am sorry.

	Lee inclines his head, stiffly, turns and walks toward his
	car.  Carter watches him.  Finally he rolls his eyes and
	yells.

				CARTER
		So are you getting on the plane or not?!

				LEE
		What?

				CARTER
		Come on, we still got time to order the
		Kosher meal.  Always get the kosher
		meal, they bring it first.

				LEE
		I cannot go to LA...

	Carter steps close, and for a second we see the man and the
	cop beneath the attitude.

				CARTER
		It sounds impossible --

				LEE
		You said --

				CARTER
		-- but if somebody gave me the chance to
		square up my father's death, I'd go to
		hell to do it.

	Carter turns, walks away without looking back.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		You want to figure out why they killed
		your Daddy, get on the plane.

				LEE
		Why LA?

				CARTER
			(still not turning)
		I guess you're going to have to trust me
		on this one.
			
			INT. 747 PASSENGER COMPARTMENT

	Carter and Lee are getting comfortable among all the other
	passengers, preparing to take off.  Lee has a moment of
	doubt.

				LEE
		I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a
		boat in Hong Kong Harbor...

				CARTER
		Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter
		Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow
		the Rich White Man.

				LEE
		Follow the Rich White Man?

				CARTER
		Almost, but you've got to say "Rich
		White Man" all run together like it's
		one word.

				LEE
		Follow the RichWhiteMan...

				CARTER
		Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere,
		has a rich white man taking his cut. 
		Every single one.  Now in our case, we
		know the rich white man is Steven Reign.

				LEE
		Who?

				CARTER
		Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky
		Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just
		before Ricky got smoked.

				LEE
		How do you know he's our man?

				CARTER
		Because when the shooting started he was
		way too cool.  See most white people,
		when there's shooting, they either hide
		in a toilet or start screaming high
		pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!

				LEE
		You sound like that all the time.

				CARTER
		Black people keep their cool when the
		shit goes down.

				LEE
		Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never
		panic.

				CARTER
		Yeah, what about when Godzilla was
		coming?  You people were screaming your
		asses off.

				LEE
		Just tell me where I can find this
		Steven Reign.

				CARTER
		The same place you find all
		RichWhiteMen.
			(a tray arrives)
		Gefilte Fish.  Lox and bagel.  I love
		this stuff.  Here, try it with a smear.

	BINOCULARS P.O.V. THE REIGN TOWERS HOTEL

	CUT TO REVEAL --

	Carter standing at a window holding high-powered binoculars.

	Lee standing next to him.  WE ARE:

	INT. CHEAP HOTEL ROOM - DOWNTOWN LA - NIGHT

	Cartons of Chinese food are all over the sleazy, run down
	hotel room.  The LIGHTS LOW, the curtains open a crack.

	BINOCULARS P.O.V. - THE REIGN HOTEL

	Traveling up the side of the Reign Hotel.  Stopping at the
	penthouse floor - where we see ISABELLA talking with Steven
	Reign in a hotel room.  After a BEAT, Reign walks to the
	door.

	Carter flips the binoculars to Lee, who starts watching.

				CARTER
		Yeah, that's definitely the woman from
		Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in
		his suite at his hotel, I told you this
		would work out.  They still just
		talking?

				LEE
		He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.

				CARTER
		He'll be back soon.

				LEE
		How do you know?

				CARTER
		Look at her.  Now, wake me in an hour,
		I'll take over.

	Lee lowers the binoculars, turns to Carter, who is trying to
	sleep on the bed.

				LEE
		Carter, there's something I have to tell
		you.  You were right about what you said
		in Hong Kong.  All I do is work.  Never
		take a day off.  It's all I have right
		now.

				CARTER
		Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.

				LEE
		The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu
		in six months.

				CARTER
		You pull a muscle or something?

				LEE
		My fiancee left me over the summer -- a
		month before our wedding.

				CARTER
		I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?

				LEE
		It's a long story.

				CARTER
		Let me guess, she couldn't handle the
		cop thing -- never knowing if you were
		dead or alive.  I've seen it a million
		times.

				LEE
		No.  It was my singing.

				CARTER
		Excuse me?

				LEE
		She hated my voice.  Said it drove her
		crazy.  I sang to her all the time - in
		bed - in the shower - I thought she
		liked it.  She finally told me it was
		driving her crazy.

	Carter stares at Lee for a long BEAT.

				CARTER
		Lee, maybe it's best if we don't discuss
		our personal lives.  Let's die curious.

	LEE LIFTS THE BINOCULARS - turns back to the building.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		What's she doing?

	BINOCULARS P.O.V. - ON ISABELLA

	She walks to the bedroom, where we see her through SHEER
	CURTAINS.  Slowly taking off her coat.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Lee?  You okay?

	Lee's eyes go wide as Isabella drops her coat and starts to
	unbutton her blouse.

				LEE
		She's just standing around -- not doing
		much.

				CARTER
		Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later
		something's gonna happen.

				LEE
		I'll try to stay awake.  It's so boring.

	Isabella starts to remove her blouse.  Lee starting to sweat
	as he watches her undress.

				LEE (CONT'D)
		Slow down, baby.

				CARTER
		What did you say?

				LEE
		Nothing.  I said nothing.

	Lee lowers his binoculars, steps away from the window.

				LEE (CONT'D)
		Is it hot in here?

				CARTER
		Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.

				LEE
		I'm gonna go in the hall and get a
		bucket of ice.  You want some ice?

				CARTER
		What's going on?  

	Lee stares at Carter, looks dazed.

				LEE
		She's getting undressed.

				CARTER
		Gimme the binoculars.

				LEE
		No.  It's not right.

				CARTER
		Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot
		you.

	Lee hands Carter the binoculars, then turns his back as
	Carter watches to the window.

				LEE
		What's she doing?

				CARTER
		Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...

				LEE
		I don't want to hear this.

				CARTER
		Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra
		and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring
		Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec -
		there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it
		looks like Snoopy.

				LEE
		Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.

				CARTER
		She just took her hair down.  Now she's
		going for the bra -- the clasp is in
		front -- she's using both hands.
			(to Lee)
		You better get that ice.

	Lee steps in front of Carter, blocking his view.

				LEE
		That's enough.  We shouldn't be doing
		this!

	Isabella suddenly drops undressing and walks back to the
	living room to pick up the PHONE.  We see her clearly now in
	bra and panties.

				CARTER
		This is our job.  We took an oath as
		police officers.  If we don't do this,
		who will?  Firemen?

	Lee backs off, and Carter steps back to the window.  He sees
	Isabella hang up the phone.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Wait a sec - what the hell is that
		between her legs?

				LEE
		What?

				CARTER
		She's reaching into her panties --
		something is strapped to her leg.  Oh,
		God...please don't let it be a dick.

				LEE
		What is it?

				CARTER
		No, I don't believe this shit -- it's a
		microphone.  Lee, she's wired...

	CLOSE ON ISABELLA

	As she turns to the window.  A TAPE RECORDER in hand.  She
	puts the recording device away, walks back into the bedroom
	and puts on a robe.

				LEE
		I don't understand?

				CARTER
		She's walking back towards the door.

	BINOCULARS P.O.V.

	We see Isabella wearing a robe - standing at the door of her
	hotel room talking with someone.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		She opened the door.  Someone is
		delivering a package.

	BINOCULARS P.O.V.

	Inside the hotel room WE SEE HU LI handing her a package.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Lee...it's the girl who delivered the
		package to your office.  It's a bomb!

	Lee and Carter bolt on the move - sprinting out of the room.

	INT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - PENTHOUSE SUITE - NIGHT

	Isabella closes the door.  She BRINGS THE BOMB WITH HER as
	she walks into the bedroom --

	EXT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

	Carter and Lee run across the street, heading towards the
	entrance of the hotel.

	INT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter sprint out the Penthouse Elevators, running
	down the hallway.

	INT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - PENTHOUSE SUITE - CONTINUOUS

	Isabella takes her robe off, glances at the package, picks it
	up and starts to open it as Lee and Carter come BURSTING
	THROUGH the BEDROOM DOOR.

				LEE/CARTER
		NO!

	Carter and Lee stare at Isabella, who stands in bra and
	panties.

				CARTER
		Damn girl, you fine.

	Lee lowers his eyes as Isabella looks at him, grabbing the
	BOMB, Carter following him as they sprint out the bedroom.

	INT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter run out the suite - Lee throwing the BOMB
	toward the END OF THE HALL as he and Carter dive to the
	floor.

	Nothing happens.

	Lee looks up, SEES a HOTEL EMPLOYEE pushing a room service
	CART, about to walk right past the package --

				LEE
		GET DOWN!!

	Lee and Carter run back to the bomb.

				CARTER
		Pick it up!

				LEE
		It's your turn!

				CARTER
		I don't need a turn!

	Carter picks it up, starts running with it through the hall,
	heading for the elevator.

				LEE
		Throw it!

	Carter is about to throw it in, when HE SEES AN OLDER COUPLE
	STANDING INSIDE.

				HOTEL GUESTS
		Do you want us to hold the elevator?

				CARTER
		Get the hell away from here!

	Carter is still holding the bomb, doesn't know what to do
	with it --

				LEE
		Stairs!

	Carter throws him the bomb, and Lee runs to the stairs --

	INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

	Lee is about to throw the bomb down the stairwell -- when he
	sees TWO MAIDS WALKING toward him.

				CARTER
		Get out of the building!

	Lee looks horrified as he hangs onto the package, has no
	choice but to throw it back to Carter.

				LEE
		Roof!

	EXT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - ROOF - NIGHT

	Lee and Carter burst through the roof door - Carter trying to
	hold the bomb as far away from himself as possible. 
	He looks over the side for a place to dump it - the streets
	are filled with PEOPLE AND CARS.

				LEE
		Wait!  There's people down there!

				CARTER
		There's people up here!

				LEE
		Get it out of here!

				CARTER
		Take it!

	Lee takes the bomb, quickly ROLLS IT across the roof -- Lee
	and Carter diving to the ground once again as the bomb slides
	to the center of the roof - COMING TO A STOP RIGHT IN FRONT
	OF ISABELLA.  She's wearing a bathrobe now, clearly pissed
	off as she slowly bends down and picks up the package.

				ISABELLA
		Get on your feet.

	Lee and Carter stand and face Isabella - watch as Isabella
	begins to open the package.

				CARTER
		I wouldn't do that!!!

				LEE
		It's a bomb.

	Isabella opens the package, removing a stack of a HUNDRED
	DOLLAR BILLS.

				ISABELLA
		You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before
		I throw you both in jail for
		obstruction.

				CARTER
		Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you
		right now.

				ISABELLA
		I'm an undercover agent for the United
		States Secret Service.

				CARTER
		How do we know you're not lying?  Let me
		see your badge.

	Isabella opens her bathrobe -- WE SEE a small BADGE pinned to
	her bra.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Let me see it again?

				LEE
		We can help you.  I'm a detective in
		Hong Kong.

				ISABELLA
		I know who you are, Inspector Lee.

				LEE
		Then you know I'm not walking away from
		this case.

				CARTER
		Yeah, that's right.

				ISABELLA
		We need to get out of sight.  Come down
		to my suite.

	INT. ISABELLA'S SUITE - LATER

				ISABELLA
			(she locks the door)
		Look, I've been working this case for
		months now...

				CARTER
		So what's your story?

				ISABELLA
		They think I'm a crooked customs agent.

	Lee examines the stack of HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS from Hu Li's
	package.  Carter checks out the suite, pocketing some of the
	food from the mini fridge.

				LEE
		Is this a payoff?

				ISABELLA
		No.  It's a sample.  You guys ever heard
		of the Superbill?

				CARTER
		It's a myth.  Some kind of counterfeit.

				ISABELLA
		It's much more than a counterfeit.  14
		out of 15 world banks can't tell the
		difference.  The paper is Crane linen
		blend -- and the bills are printed on
		U.S. Intaglio presses.

				CARTER
		How're they getting into the U.S. Mint
		to use the presses?

				ISABELLA
		In 1959, the United States was very
		friendly with the Shah of Iran.  We
		wanted his oil, so for the Shah's
		birthday, the government gave him a gift
		-- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press.  The
		only one to ever leave the country. 
		Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that
		press on the black market.

				LEE
		Five years ago?!  
			(beat)
		That's right before he left the force.

	Lee and Carter exchange looks.

				ISABELLA
		It wasn't hard to spot the fakes until
		this past year.  Then Tan got hold of
		one of a kind Swiss made hundred dollar
		plates -- and started making superbills.

				LEE
			(understanding)
		And Hu Li killed him for the plates.

				ISABELLA
		Yes.  They've printed and shipped one
		hundred million dollars, and there's
		only one way to spot a fake.

	Isabella lights a HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL on fire, and it burns
	RED.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		They use an optical transfer ink from
		India that burns red -- the real ink
		burns black.

				CARTER
		What the hell are they going to do with
		a hundred million dollars in funny
		money?

				ISABELLA
		The real question is, where are the
		plates?  If we can find the plates, we
		can stop the whole operation.

	Isabella thinks for a beat.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		Maybe that's where you can help us. 
		Carter, this is your city, right?

	Carter nods.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		And Lee, you know Hu Li and the Triads?

	Lee nods.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		Okay, find out where Hu Li's keeping the
		plates.
			(hands Lee a card with a phone
			 number)
		Welcome aboard, gentlemen.  From this
		moment on, you're working for the United
		States Secret Service.

	Isabella opens the door to let Lee and Carter out.  They exit
	quickly, trying to hide their excitement.  CAMERA STAYS on
	Isabella as she takes out her CELL PHONE, punches in a
	number.

				STERLING (O.S.)
		Sterling.

				ISABELLA
		Lee and Carter are officially out of the
		Secret Service's way...

	EXT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter, both wearing dark sunglasses, walk through
	the street trying their best to look like Secret Service
	Agents.  They approach Carter's parked VETTE.

				CARTER
		Secret Service Agent Carter.  This is my
		calling, Lee. 
		Give me six months and I'll be in
		Washington protecting a white guy.

				LEE
		We both know you would never take a
		bullet for someone else.

				CARTER
		They don't know that.  What are they
		gonna do, try and shoot the President
		during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella
		can pull some strings.  You saw the way
		she was staring at me.

				LEE
		She never even looked at you.

				CARTER
		You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked
		me.  I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're
		third world ugly.

				LEE
		I am not third world ugly.  Women like
		me, they think I'm cute.  Like Snoopy.

				CARTER
		Snoopy is about six inches taller than
		you.  I'm sorry, Lee, you never had a
		chance.

	Carter's had the last word, he gets into the Vette.  Lee
	reluctantly gets in, too.
			
			EXT. CRENSHAW KITCHEN - CHINESE SOUL FOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	Carter's Vette pulls up in front of a hole in the wall.  

	INT. CRENSHAW KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

	Carter and Lee pass through the restaurant, only two tables
	are occupied.

	INT. KITCHEN

	Carter and Lee enter the busy kitchen where the OWNER, a
	BLACK MAN named KENNY, is yelling in Chinese to an over
	worked waiter.  Kenny's wife, a spectacular looking Chinese
	woman, works the stove.  A couple of cute half-black, half
	Asian kids run around the kitchen.

				CARTER
		Kenny!  How you doin'?

	Kenny looks up at Carter.  A cool, appraising glance.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		How's the action tonight?  The house
		making out okay?

	Kenny follows as Carter opens a door to --

	INT. BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	MEN seated around several card tables, playing MAH-JONGG for
	big money.  Lee and Kenny follow Carter inside.  It's very
	smokey and very crowded.

				CARTER
			(to Kenny)
		This is where I say I'm LAPD in a loud
		voice, they all scream and run and shit. 
		Watch.  It's real funny.

	Kenny grabs Carter's shoulder, pulling him aside.

				KENNY
		Come with me.

	INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

	Kenny leads Carter and Lee in, closes the door.

				KENNY
		Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong
		Kong, James.

				CARTER
		What??  Where'd you hear that?

				KENNY
		I got my sources.

				CARTER
		And I got mine, meaning you.  Nice how
		that works out.
			(beat)
		I'm serious this time, I'm closing this
		place down.

				KENNY
		James, you see my kids back there?  You
		know how much I'm paying for private
		school?  How can you come in here with
		this attitude, you being little Chang's
		godfather?

				CARTER
		Little Chang is gonna have to go visit
		his daddy in jail if you don't
		cooperate.

				KENNY
		Jail!?  James, you better back off. 
		Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.

				CARTER
		I'd like to see you try.

	Kenny takes a step back and throws a lightning fast martial
	arts move.  Lee gets in front of Carter to protect him --
	countering Kenny's move.

				KENNY
			(to Lee)
		We're on, then.

	Kenny throws out another precision martial arts sequence --
	Lee BLOCKS -- Kenny ends in an advanced fighting stance.

				LEE
			(impressed)
		That's a good Twisting Tiger -- where
		did you learn that?

	They switch to Chinese.

				KENNY
		Master Ching taught me.

				LEE
		The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?

				KENNY
		No.  Freddy Ching's, in Crenshaw.

	Lee smiles, Carter looks back and forth from Lee to Kenny.

				KENNY (CONT'D)
		What are you doing hanging out with Baby
		Duck?

				LEE
		Baby Duck?

				KENNY
		That's what we all used to call him when
		he was a kid -- cause he was always
		quacking.  Never shut up.

				CARTER
		I heard that.

	Lee and Kenny laugh.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Look, I need some info and I don't have
		time to play around.

				KENNY
		Is this about the funny money?

				CARTER
		How'd you know?

				KENNY
		You've been asking loud questions in all
		the wrong places all morning.  How come
		you always save me for last, James? 
		When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't
		happen I don't know about.

				CARTER
		So tell me what you know.

				KENNY
		I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty
		good double sawbuck -- but you knew that
		too, didn't you?

				CARTER
		Yeah.  We already been there.  This is
		big, Kenny.  Benjamins.  Secret Service
		calls 'em superbills.  Banks can't even
		tell the difference.

	Kenny considers this for a moment.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		What?

				KENNY
		One of my regulars lost fifty thousand
		dollars at the table here last week.  I
		was about to send my boys down to tune
		his ass up, when the guy comes in and
		pays off the whole thing.  Including the
		vig -- brand new sequential hundred
		dollar bills.  I knew something was
		wrong.  Cause this guy's got a regular
		job, no way he comes up with fifty grand
		in cash. 
		But I tested the bills, infrared.  The
		whole thing.  And they checked out. 
		100%.

				LEE
		Do you still have the bills?

				KENNY
		I still have my lunch money from third
		grade.

				CARTER
		Lemme see 'em.

	Kenny pushes a Chinese painting aside to reveal a WALL SAFE. 
	He opens the safe and hands Carter a $100 bill.  Carter
	checks it out.

				KENNY
		See.  It's perfect.

	Carter takes out a LIGHTER and holds the flame to it.

				KENNY (CONT'D)
		Whoa, what are you doing?

	Kenny's question is answered as the BILL BURNS BRIGHT RED.

				KENNY (CONT'D)
			(pissed off)
		I knew it.  The guy's name is Zing.  He
		works at the kitchen at Reign Plaza.

				CARTER
		All right, Kenny.  Thanks.  You're off
		the hook.  For now.

	Carter and Lee move for the door.

				KENNY
		You sure you guys don't want to stay and
		have a bite?  My wife's got the best mu
		shu this side of Compton.

	Carter and Lee exchange a look as we CUT TO:
			
			EXT. REIGN PLAZA - DAY

	Establishing.  Carter and Lee park their car and walk inside.

	EXT. REIGN SHIPPING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Carter and Lee enter.

				CARTER
			(to a worker)
		We're looking for a guy named Zing.  Is
		he here?

	Zing hears Carter, turns and sees them.  Then RUNS.  Carter
	and Lee exchange looks and run after him.

	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Zing sprints down an employee hallway, through a doorway and
	down some stairs.  Carter and Lee in pursuit.

	EXT. LOADING DOCK PLATFORM - REIGN PLAZA - CONTINUOUS

	Carter and Lee burst out the door at the bottom of the
	stairway -- coming almost face to face with --

	HU LI

	Who has her gun out.  Waiting for them.  ISABELLA is standing
	near by, and ZING is visible off to the side.  An 18-WHEELER
	in the loading bay is just being shut and locked.  A LIMO is
	parked beside it.

	Lee and Carter both assume fighting positions.  When most of
	the other WORKERS pull guns; other TRIAD SOLDIERS step out,
	putting their guns close on Lee and Carter.  They can't blink
	without getting mowed down.

				HU LI
			(in Chinese)
		The great Chief Inspector Lee -- I will
		be remembered for ridding the Triads of
		your petulance.

	Hu Li savors the moment.

				CARTER
		I hope you just said I have no business
		being here, 'cos I was just leaving.

	Carter starts to leave, and Hu Li trains her gun on him,
	freezing him in his tracks.  Isabella slowly walks several
	feet, ending up behind Lee as she speaks.

				ISABELLA
		Hu Li, I think there's someone who will
		want to talk to them first.

	Hu Li looks at Isabella, nods an acknowledgement.  BANG!  Lee
	falls.  Isabella's knocked him out from behind with the butt
	of her gun.

	BANG!  Carter drops to one knee as Hu Li POUNDS him across
	the jaw with her fist.

				CARTER
		...oh, that's a filling right there. 
		That's gonna cost you.

	Hu Li lunges forward and KICKS Carter, sending him backwards.

				HU LI
		Put them in the truck.

	The WORKERS pick up Lee, bring him to the back of the truck.

				CARTER
		I should kill you right now, but I'm
		gonna let you live, 'cause you're fine,
		and maybe you can be reformed.

	The WORKERS start towards Carter.  He holds up his hands.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		No more hitting.  I'll get in the truck
		myself.

	As Carter walks towards the truck by Hu Li, they exchange a
	look of sheer hatred.  As soon as he passes by her, Hu Li
	COLDCOCKS Carter with her gun.

	EXT. LOADING DOCK PLATFORM - DAY

	The eighteen wheeler, the limo and the black Lincoln Town car
	pull out of the loading dock, headed for the highway.

	EXT. EIGHTEEN WHEELER - DAY

	The truck pulls onto a HIGHWAY, the LIMO close behind it.

	INT. EIGHTEEN WHEELER - TRUCK BED - DAY

	LEE and CARTER are in the back with crates filled with MONEY.

	They're both in pain, trying to recover from the head blows. 
	Carter is flexing his battered body.

				LEE
		Are you okay?

				CARTER
		What's the first thing I told you --
		never trust nobody.  How could you fall
		for that shit?  I knew she was dirty.

				LEE
		She saved our lives.

				CARTER
		For how long?  Face it, Lee, she's
		playing both sides.

	Lee looks disappointed.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Look, man I'm sorry.  I know you got a
		thing for her.

				LEE
		Shhh, my head hurts.

				CARTER
		I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh"
		me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky
		Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang
		Long are not in South Central.  I didn't
		have to help you.

				LEE
		Why did you help me?

				CARTER
		It doesn't matter.

	Lee thinks about this for a BEAT.

				LEE
		I'm not used to having a partner.

				CARTER
		We are not partners.  Between your
		daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just
		took, as far as I can tell all partners
		get you is dead.

				LEE
		Well we're not friends.

				CARTER
		You got that right.  And we ain't
		brothers.  Maybe we should just end this
		right here.

				LEE
		Fine with me.

				CARTER
		I won't talk to you, you don't talk to
		me.  We'll die in peace.

				LEE
		See you in the next world.

	A BEAT OF SILENCE

				CARTER
		I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I
		won't see you in the next world.

				LEE
		Fine. 

				CARTER
		I believe in heaven.  You people believe
		in heaven?

				LEE
		Yes.  We have heaven.

				CARTER
		Is it the same heaven, or is it a
		Chinese heaven?

				LEE
		What's a Chinese heaven?

				CARTER
		I thought it might be like those five
		foot and under basketball leagues.  They
		don't let everybody in.

				LEE
		I think we should stop talking.

				CARTER
		Fine by me.

	ANOTHER BEAT OF SILENCE

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		You thinking about that girl that dumped
		you?

				LEE
		No.

				CARTER
		If she was the right girl, you'd be
		thinking about her.

				LEE
		Mind your own business.

				CARTER
		How was the sex?

				LEE
		There was no sex.  She was very
		traditional.  We were waiting until we
		were married.

				CARTER
		You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No
		mu-shu?

				LEE
		No mu-shu.

				CARTER
		What about a little king pao chicken?

				LEE
		No kung pao chicken.  Never.

				CARTER
		Steamed dumplings?

				LEE
		Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But
		only when she was drunk.

				CARTER
		That's rough, man.  If I don't get
		steamed dumplings once a week, I go
		crazy.

				LEE
		Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think
		I have a good voice?

				CARTER
		Are you serious?

				LEE
		Forget it.  It doesn't matter.

	Lee turns away from Carter.

				CARTER
		As long as you're asking...I think you
		have a pretty good voice.

				LEE
		I knew it.  What does she know.  You
		want me to sing something?

				CARTER
		That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long
		usually kill their victims?

				LEE
		They'll probably torture us first, shock
		our privates, then put two bullets in
		our eyes and one in the back of the
		head.

				CARTER
		Go ahead.  Sing your ass off.

	Lee clears his voice.

				LEE
		Did you happen to see the most beautiful
		girl in the world...and if you did, was
		she crying, crying...hey!

	EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY

	The 18-WHEELER drives by followed by the LIMO.

	INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY

	Hu Li and Isabella sit in the back of one of the limos that
	is driving behind the truck.  Hu Li is on the car phone.

				HU LI
		Don't worry, the plates are safe.  Yes,
		the dragon's been fed.

	She HANGS UP and glances at Isabella, who is doing her best
	to appear completely uninterested.

	EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

	The LIMO splits off from the 18-WHEELER.

	INT. 18-WHEELER - TRUCK BED - CONTINUOUS

	Carter works at opening one of the crates.  Lee steps up,
	takes a deep breath, searches the crate looking for the sweet
	spot, and PUNCHES a hole in one of the thick boards.  They
	start prying the crate open.

				CARTER
		Very nice.

				LEE
		It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak
		spot.  You ignore everything around you,
		and put all your energy into one perfect
		strike.

				CARTER
		I'll remember that next time I'm
		fighting a box.

	Carter opens the crate -- it's filled with SUPERBILLS, about
	$1,000,000 worth.  He tosses a stack to Lee.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Hello, Benjamin.

				LEE
		Who's Benjamin?

				CARTER
		Benjamin Franklin, he discovered
		electricity.

				LEE
		A Chinese man discovered electricity.

				CARTER
		No Chinese man discovered electricity.

				LEE
		Yes he did.  He also invented the
		bicycle.

				CARTER
		Now that I believe.

	Carter pockets two stacks of superbills.  Lee looks at him.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		You never know.  Besides, I always
		wanted to die rich.

	The truck lurches.

				LEE
		We're slowing down.  This must be it.

				CARTER
		End of the line.

				LEE
		You've been a good friend, James Carter.

				CARTER
		Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting
		corny on me, Lee.  I'll kick your ass
		from here to Compton.

				LEE
		You could never kick my ass.  You mama's
		boy.

				CARTER
		Don't you talk about my mama.
			(winks at Lee)
		That's more like it.

	EXT. 18-WHEELER - CONTINUOUS

	The truck is parked in the underground loading docks.  It's
	approached by FOUR TRIAD SOLDIERS.  Soldier #1 opens the
	TRUCK'S DOUBLE DOORS to find.

	Lee and Carter are gone.  Except for boxes of money, the
	truck bed is EMPTY.

	Two soldiers enter the truck bed.

	ANGLE UP TO REVEAL

	Lee and Carter WEDGED up against the CEILING of the truck
	bed.  Above the doors and over the soldiers.

	Lee and Carter SWING DOWN in unison -- knocking both soldiers
	to the ground.  In the next instant:

	ON LEE

	still holding on to the door frame -- swings and backflips
	onto the roof of the truck.

	ON CARTER

	who swings onto the ground -- grabbing one of the guards to
	use a shield as gunfire erupts.

	Lee jumps off the truck, knocking the last guard to the
	ground.  He then grabs the guard Carter is using as a shield
	and together THEY SWING him into the truck -- KNOCKING DOWN
	the first two guards.

	Carter and Lee slam the back doors SHUT -- bolting them
	CLOSED and run like hell - scrambling into what looks like
	the closest way out:

	A LARGE OPEN PIPE on the side of the tunnel.

	INT. SEWER TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter run through - it extends out from the
	underground loading docks.

				LEE
		This way.  I see some lights.

	Lee and Carter spot a tiny sliver of light coming through a
	MANHOLE COVER.  They start climbing up the metal stairs that
	lead up to the street.

	EXT. LAS VEGAS BLVD. - DUSK

	The blvd.'s packed with PEOPLE and CARS.  

	CLOSE ON

	Lee and Carter coming up from the manhole -- standing
	together in stunned disbelief as they look out at the LAS
	VEGAS STRIP.  They cover their eyes, blinded by the greatest
	light show in the world.

				LEE
		Vegas...

				CARTER
		Lee.  I just got an idea how someone
		could launder a hundred million dollars
		in cash.

	They both turn around and come FACE TO FACE WITH:

	A TEN-STORY DRAGON.  Fire shoots from its nostrils every 60
	SECONDS.
			
			EXT. RED DRAGON HOTEL AND CASINO - NIGHT

	FIRE BALLS BLOW out over the strip as Lee and Carter look up
	at the RED DRAGON.  The HUGE NEON SIGN READS: GRAND OPENING -
	EVERYBODY'S A WINNER!

	Lee and Carter come out of the sewer.

				LEE
		Red Dragon.

				CARTER
		That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat.

	Lee and Carter watch as limos pull up to the front of the
	hotel -- it's like a HOLLYWOOD PREMIERE.  The richest of the
	rich are making their way inside.

				LEE
		Let's go.

				CARTER
		Wait a second.  We can't go in like
		this.  Look at this place, we gotta look
		fly.  We gotta Mac out.

				LEE
		What is Mac out?

				CARTER
		Follow me my Asian brother.

	Carter and Lee start to walk away.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Just stay down wind, because I think you
		stepped in some serious rat shit down
		there.

	EXT. VERSACE BOUTIQUE - NIGHT

	Lee and Carter are walking into the upscale clothing store.

	INT. VERSACE BOUTIQUE - CONTINUOUS

	As they enter, a SALESMAN approaches them.

				SALESMAN
		May I help you gentlemen?

	Carter flashes his biggest smile as he pulls out a stack of
	superbills.

				CARTER
		Black.  42-long.  Nothing touches this
		body but pure silk.  And get my partner
		something from the children's
		department.

	Carter puts his hand on Lee's shoulder.

				SALESMAN
		Would your partner like silk as well?  I
		personally like it when a couple
		matches.

	Carter takes his hand off Lee's shoulder.

				CARTER
		Couple?  No, you got it wrong, there's
		no couple here.  Just two single police
		officers working a very dangerous case.

				LEE
		Yes.  We have lots of big men chasing
		us.

				SALESMAN
		I'm sure all the boys are chasing you
		two.  Don't worry, I'll make you guys
		the bell of the ball.

	He WINKS as he walks off, and Carter looks at Lee.

				CARTER
		This is the last time I go shopping with
		you.

	EXT. RED DRAGON - NIGHT

	Lee and Carter enter frame, dressed to kill - perfectly
	tailored couture Versace suits, gold watches, the whole bit. 
	Le is awkward in "player" guise.

				CARTER
			(whispering)
		Remember, Lee, you're a player now.  You
		own the place.

	Carter pulls out his ALTOIDS, and he and Lee each take one as
	they walk through the doors.

				LEE
		I own the place.

	INT. RED DRAGON - CONTINUOUS

	Carter STRUTS through the lobby, Lee doing his best to
	imitate Carter's pimp and roll.  THEY WALK PAST THE GIANT
	BUDDHA --

				CARTER
		That looks exactly like my Uncle
		Darrell.

				LEE
		Buddha is the symbol of luck and good
		fortune.

				CARTER
		Buddha is the symbol for fat and lazy. 
		The man has the biggest tits in Asia.

	They are moving through the MAIN ENTRY HALL lined with TERRA
	COTTA CHINESE SOLDIERS - posed and dressed for battle.

	RICKSHAWS and BICYCLES take people through the hotel.  The
	MAIN CASINO is roped off and empty.  People crowded around
	the perimeter - a sign reads:

				SIGN
		$50,000 buy in -- EVERYBODY'S A WINNER!

	The LIGHTS DIM - a spotlight comes on and finds STEVEN REIGN
	on the balcony overlooking the ENTRANCE.

				STEVEN REIGN
		A thousand years ago, a small, wealthy
		village in China hired a young Dragon to
		guard their treasure in a cave, hoping
		to scare off potential bandits.  Their
		plan worked quite well, until the people
		of the village started sneaking the
		Dragon extra food -- hoping to make him
		bigger and stronger.  The Dragon ate so
		much and grew so big -- that he
		eventually got stuck inside the cave --
		and the treasure was stuck behind him
		for all eternity.
			(beat)
		Ladies and gentlemen, I have found that
		lost treasure.  It is here, inside the
		greatest casino in the world!  Welcome
		to the Red Dragon, where everybody is a
		winner!

	Reign smiles, flips a switch -- the CASINO COMES TO LIFE. 
	Fireworks, bright lights, endless rows of tables, dealers
	waiting.

	A BAND PLAYS on a stage in the casino lounge.

	Chinese ACROBATS perform suspended from the ceiling and on
	the balconies above.

	Applause all around as the FLAME shoots out of the dragon's
	nostrils and the acrobats perform.  Carter and Lee walk down
	the red carpet.

				CARTER
			(to waitress)
		Bring us some twelve-year old scotch...
			(to a cigarette girl)
		Get us a box of your finest cigars.
			(to a change girl)
		Give me ten dollars in nickels.
						
	INT. CASINO - NIGHT

	CLOSE ON

	Dice ROLLING on a craps table.

				CRAPS DEALER
		Winner!  Seven!

	We see BLACKJACK DEALERS BUSTING - paying out CUSTOMERS.

	Hundred dollar slot machines paying out jackpots.

	GAMBLERS winning all over the casino.  Then going to the main
	cage and exchanging their chips for SUPERBILLS.

				CARTER
		Look at this place, Lee.  The biggest
		front in the world.

	As people pour into the casino, Steven Reign is making his
	way through the crowd, shaking hands and posing for pictures.

				LEE
		Carter...here comes the rich white man.

				CARTER
		Wait here.  I'll handle this.

	As Carter walks off, a WOMAN grabs Lee and pulls him onto the
	dance floor.

	INT. LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

	The woman spins to face Lee, her face half-hidden under the
	dance floor lights.

				ISABELLA
		Put your arms around me.

				LEE
		Excuse me?

	Isabella grabs him around the waist, pulls him close.

				ISABELLA
		Hold me close.  There's cameras
		everywhere.

	An ASIAN BAND sings STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT as Lee tries his
	best to slow dance.  An intimate moment between Isabella and
	Lee, her face nestled in the crook of his neck, hiding her
	face.

				LEE
		What's going on?

				ISABELLA
		I need your help.

				LEE
		Last time you needed my help I ended up
		in the back of a truck.

				ISABELLA
		I'm undercover.  I had no choice.  You
		have to trust me.

	Lee starts to get into the music, moving his hips in a slow,
	sensual rhythm.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		You move well.

				LEE
		Just trying to make it look real.

				ISABELLA
		Look over there.  That's the eye in the
		sky room.

	Lee looks over her shoulder. 

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		Behind me is the soft count room.  We're
		pretty sure the plates are back there.

				LEE
		Why don't you go get them?

				ISABELLA
		If I'm wrong then my cover is blown.

				
	INT. CASINO - NIGHT

	As Steven Reign makes his way through the casino, Carter
	steps right in front of him, giving him a big hug.

				CARTER
		Stevie, how's it going my man?  Somebody
		get a picture, we can use it for a mug
		shot.

				STEVEN REIGN
		Detective Carter, you always seem to
		show up where you don't belong.

				CARTER
		Lemme ask you something, Steven.  And I
		want the truth.  Is there any way I can
		date your daughter?  Just dinner and a
		movie, maybe go listen to some jazz...

				STEVEN REIGN
		Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I
		crawled out from under the first rock. 
		Do you really think you can intimidate
		me here?

				CARTER
		You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most
		counterfeiters only get ten cents on the
		dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure
		genius.

				STEVEN REIGN
		You play games with me, Detective, and
		you'll lose every time.  Don't forget. 
		The odds are always in favor of the
		house.

	Reign walks off with his men.  Carter watches him leave.

	INT. DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT

	Lee is dancing close with Isabella.

				ISABELLA
		The Secret Service almost busted Reign
		at his casino in Macao, but the place
		burned down before we could move in.

				LEE
		How do I know I can trust you?

				ISABELLA
		Dip me!

	Lee dips her, holds her in his arms for a long BEAT.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		I'm asking for real now -- will you help
		the Secret Service?

				LEE
		No.
			(beat)
		But I'll help you.

	Lee holds her for a long BEAT, their lips almost touching. 
	He finally lets her go, and she disappears into the crowd. 
	Carter walks up, sees Lee standing alone on the dance floor.

				CARTER
		Lee, what the hell are you doing?

				LEE
		Dancing?

				CARTER
		Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong
		arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the
		line, and you're up here dancing with
		some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?

				LEE
		It was Isabella.  She says the plates
		are in the soft count room.

	Lee motions to the room, where WE SEE a SECURITY GUARD
	standing in front of a small door.

				CARTER
		Isabella?  Are you crazy, man?  She
		almost got us killed.  She's setting you
		up again!

				LEE
		No.  I'm going to find out.

				CARTER
		Wait a second.  There's guards all over
		the place.  You'll need a distraction.

	Carter looks around the casino.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		I'll go to the craps table, make a big
		scene.  When security comes over, you
		make your move.  

				LEE
		Try to keep them busy for five minutes.

				CARTER
		I'll give it my best shot.
						
			INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

	Carter walks up to a CRAPS TABLE, everyone turning to stare.

				CRAPS DEALER
		Sir, you're aware that we require a
		fifty-thousand dollar buy in to gamble
		here this weekend?

	Carter throws a HUNDRED THOUSAND in $100 BILLS onto the
	table.

				CARTER
		I saw the sign, I can read.  Now gimme a
		hundred-thousand in chips.  And a Diet
		Coke and some wash-n-dries.  Let's move,
		people, I came to play.

	The DEALER pushes 100K worth of CHIPS in front of Carter.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		What the hell is that?

				CRAPS DEALER
		Those are five hundred dollar chips.

				CARTER
		Did you give me five-hundred dollar
		chips because I'm black?

				CRAPS DEALER
		No, I just assumed...

				CARTER
		You assumed a brother coming in here can
		only afford five-hundred dollars a roll,
		is that right?  Are you a racist?

				CRAPS DEALER
		No, sir.

				CARTER
			(starting to scream)
		Everyone else at the table has thousand
		dollar chips, but the black man gets the
		nickel, is that it?  Did my people
		survive two-hundred years of slavery so
		you could send us back to the cotton
		fields with five-hundred dollar chips? 
		Do I look like Chicken George to you?

	The PIT BOSS gets on his walkie-talkie.

				PIT BOSS
		Floor security, we have a problem at
		table nine.

	EXT. SOFT COUNT ROOM - NIGHT

	The SECURITY GUARD lowers his walkie-talkie, starts moving
	towards Carter's table.

	INT. CRAPS TABLE - NIGHT

	TWO SECURITY GUARDS approach Carter's table.

				CARTER
		Answer me one question.  How come Ben
		Vereen isn't performing here at the
		hotel?  Is Ben Vereen not good enough
		for you people?

				PIT BOSS
		Lionel Ritchie is performing here
		tonight.

				CARTER
		Lionel Ritchie hasn't been black since
		the Commodores.

				PIT BOSS
		Sir, you're going to have to calm down.

	Carter watches as Lee moves past the guard and makes his way
	into the soft count room.

				CARTER
		I have a dream, where black people and
		white people can gamble together without
		getting different chips!

	A BIG CROWD has gathered as the Security Guards try and push
	their way through.  The pit boss picks up the phone, calls
	upstairs.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Sing with me!  "We shall overcome!"

	Carter starts clapping, and the confused crowd joins in as
	the Security Guards move in.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Thank you.  Now in the spirit of
		brotherhood, let's play craps!

	INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Lee walks into the hallway, moving like a cat as he hugs the
	walls and tries to make his way to the soft count room.

	He hears noise, TWO SECURITY GUARDS coming behind him through
	the casino door.  He has no choice but to crawl over the back
	of a money cart and hug the top.  He lies as still as he can,
	trying not to be seen -- until he realizes he's staring
	directly into the EYE IN THE SKY cameras that are in the
	ceiling.

	WE SEE LEE'S FACE

	as he passes directly under the camera, clearly mouthing the
	words "oh shit" as he rolls by.

	Lee looks to his left, sees the SOFT COUNT ROOM -- a mountain
	of COUNTERFEIT SUPERBILLS that are waiting to be paid out. 
	On the opposite side, the REAL MONEY is being WHEELED OUT
	toward a waiting TRUCK that is parked at the back door.

	Lee sees two more cameras in the ceiling, knows his cover is
	blown.  He jumps down off the cart, is standing in front of
	the locked vault.  There's no way to get the plates. 
	Isabella has set him up again.

	He turns and smiles at the confused SECURITY GUARDS.

				LEE
		Hi.  How's it going?  You guys have
		change for a twenty?

	The GUARDS make their move.  And Lee starts to fight them
	down the hall, using the cart as a shield as he RAMS into TWO
	MORE GUARDS, fights them off as he turns the corner toward
	the casino door -- but he gets slammed to the ground by a
	right cross.

	Hu Li threw the punch, a roll of quarters in her hand as she
	stands over him with FIVE TRIAD SOLDIERS.  She holds a knife
	to Lee's throat.

				HU LI
			(in Chinese)
		Open your mouth.

	She puts the small grenade in Lee's mouth, tapes it shut. 
	She holds the detonator in her hand.

				HU LI (CONT'D)
			(continuing in Chinese)
		That's a ying-tao grenade, Inspector. 
		Please follow me or I'll blow 32 teeth
		into your brain.

	INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

	A crowd has gathered behind Carter who is at the table
	rolling dice, a huge stack of chips in front of him.

				CRAPS DEALER
		Winner six!

				CARTER
		How much is that?

				CRAPS DEALER
		Two-hundred thousand!

				CARTER
		Two-hundred thousand dollars?  Who wants
		a hundred dollars?

	Carter turns to the MAN next to him, who wears a traditional
	AFRICAN ROBE and is standing with a giant blonde escort.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Here, your highness, have a hundred
		dollars.  The Viagra is on me tonight!

				GAMBLER
			(South African accent)
		I am not royalty, sir.

				CARTER
		Don't say that, we're all royalty.  My
		great grandmammy was Queen Nephertit --
		we probably cousins, man.  How much you
		got on the table?

				GAMBLER
		One million.

				CARTER
		Yeah, we definitely cousins now.  Who
		wants to blow on my hand for luck?

	Carter turns to a BIG TEXAN who is standing with a GORGEOUS
	YOUNG GIRL who is falling out of her dress.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Hey, Marlboro man, you mind if your lady
		blows on my hand for luck?

				TEXAN
			(embarrassed)
		She's not my lady.  She's my niece.

				CARTER
		Can I come over for Thanksgiving?  Come
		on, baby, give me some luck.

	The GIRL blows on the dice, and Carter stares down at her.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Nice blowing.  When's your next
		birthday, I'll be the cake.

				TEXAN
		Hey, buddy, watch yourself.

				CARTER
		Don't threaten me.  I got friends in
		this town that will bite off your ears. 
		Just sit tight, because I've got the
		dice and I am on fire!

	Carter throws the dice.

				CRAPS DEALER
		Winner, seven!

	The table erupts as Carter grabs the dice.

				CARTER
		Let it ride!
						
			INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

	The elevator doors OPEN and Lee is led toward the eye in the
	sky room by Hu Li and the three Triads.  As they walk into
	the room, the Triads remain outside guarding the room.

	INT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	FORTY VIDEO MONITORS show every inch of the hotel.  A MAN
	stands in front of the two-way mirror looking down at the
	casino, the reflection off the glass obscuring his features.

	Lee has the tape around his mouth and his hands tied behind
	his back as he's led into the room by Hu Li.

				RICKY TAN
		Imagine a business where people hand you
		money.  And you hand them back
		absolutely nothing.

	Ricky Tan - alive and well, turns around and stares at Lee. 
	Isabella is standing next to him.  Lee is shocked at the
	sight of Ricky Tan alive.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
		Now that's a true American dream. 
		Thanks to a few pieces of metal and a
		very greed driven US Customs agent.

	Ricky Tan walks toward Lee, starts to smile.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
		Look at you, you're ridiculous.  You
		know it didn't have to be like this. 
		But it's too bad!  Like father, like
		son.

	Lee stares at Isabella for a BEAT.  Hu Li motions to one of
	the monitors.

				HU LI
			(in Chinese)
		He's going for the plates.

	Ricky Tan looks at one of the MONITORS, sees Steven Reign
	walking down a hallway, about to walk into the PENTHOUSE
	SUITE.

				RICKY TAN
		Look at this old fool, what does he
		think he's doing?

	Ricky Tan shifts his attention back to Lee.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
		It's almost impossible to find a partner
		that's trustworthy and loyal.  Wouldn't
		you agree, Lee?

	ON ANOTHER SCREEN

	We see Carter at the craps table having the time of his life. 
	Ricky Tan turns to walk out of the room, motioning to
	Isabella as he goes.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
		Well, at least you will die with honor. 
		But choy Gien.

	SUBTITLES: "Won't see you again."

	INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

	Carter has two racks of chips in front of him, a huge crowd
	surrounding him.

				CRAPS DEALER
		Winner!  Four, winner!

				CARTER
		I'm up a hundred and fifty-grand. 
		That's a Ferrari.  Do they sell those
		here in the gift shop?  Somebody cash me
		out!

	Several TRIAD SOLDIERS dressed like SECURITY GUARDS approach
	Carter's table.

				PIT BOSS
		Sir, we'd like to escort you to the
		cashier.

				CARTER
		That would be great.  Don't want any of
		these rich white people to jump me.

	As they walk toward the door marked "VIP ROOM", Carter
	glances at the MEN, knows he's in deep shit.

	INT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - NIGHT

	Ricky Tan turns to Hu Li.

				RICKY TAN
		Chai Hu Li.
			("Little Fox")
		Have fun.

	Ricky Tan walks out.  Hu Li holds the detonator up to Lee,
	plays with the button.

				HU LI
			(in Chinese)
		In a few minutes...you'll beg me to push
		this button.

	Hu Li pulls her KNIFE, moves towards Lee.  She holds the
	blade to his face.  About to cut him.  When Isabella pulls
	her gun.

	Isabella walks toward Lee, whose hands are still tied behind
	his back.  Hu Li clutches the detonator in one hand, her
	knife in the other.  She takes a step toward Isabella.

				ISABELLA
		It's time to end this, Inspector.

	Isabella cocks the gun, spins back and kicks the detonator
	from Hu Li's hand -- slamming her against the wall and
	sticking the gun under her chin.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		Don't move!  United States Secret
		Service.

	Hu Li WHIPS her KNIFE around, catches Isabella across the
	hand -- the GUN SLIDING across the room near the detonator --
	the TWO WOMEN fight around it.

	Lee watches them almost step on it - dives to the floor and
	rolls toward the detonator.  He's about to grab it when:

	THE TRIADS OPEN THE DOOR

	They're about to move in.

				HU LI
		Get the detonator!

	The Triads go for the detonator -- as Lee gets to his feet,
	KICKS Hu Li's legs out from under her.

	One of the Triads about to pick up the detonator - but Lee
	gets to him first.  He fights with one hand tied behind his
	back.

	Hu Li and Isabella fight it out in the EYE IN THE SKY ROOM.

	Lee gets kicked towards the Eye In The Sky WINDOW.

	INT. CASINO - CASHIER

	Two security guards lead Carter away from the table when:

	CRASH!

	An AIRBORNE Lee rockets through the EYE IN THE SKY WINDOW. 
	In a rain of glass, he lands HARD on the casino floor.

	The NOISE grabs everyone's attention, including:

				CARTER
		Lee!!

	The guards restrain him.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Lemme ask you something.  Any of you
		ever felt $500,000 before?

	He SLAMS THE RACK OF CHIPS ACROSS THEIR FACES -- chips flying
	as the GUARDS hit the floor.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Doesn't feel so good, does it?

	INT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Hu Li picks up the detonator.  WHACK!  A heeled foot kicks it
	from her grasp.  Isabella has recovered!  The detonator FLIES
	OUT THE BROKEN WINDOW.

	INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

	On his back, Lee watches the detonator SAIL OVER HIS HEAD AND
	DISAPPEAR into the crowd.  It lands on a DRINK CART.  Before
	Lee can get there, a WAITRESS changes trays and carries the
	detonator on her rounds.

	Panicked, Lee searches for the detonator.  He JUMPS atop a
	BLACKJACK TABLE to get a better vantage.  He can't see it,
	but he does see:

	ACROSS THE CASINO

	Carter on top of a CRAPS TABLE, keeping security guards at
	bay with a croupier stick.

				CARTER
		Black man gets on a hot streak and
		you're all trippin'?

	Carter and Lee see each other.  They have the same
	simultaneous though:

				CARTER (CONT'D)
			(help!)
		Lee!

				LEE
			(help!)
		MMMMMM!!!!

	Carter is Lee's only hope to get the bomb out of his mouth. 
	But from here to there, a MASS OF PEOPLE.  The quickest way
	is the HIGH WAY.

	Lee leaps from TABLE to TABLE.  Scattering playing cards. 
	Reaching the carpeted divide...Lee doesn't stop. 
	He launches off the bent-over back of a high roller --
	landing on a RICKSHAW, SURFING IT to the tables on the other
	side.

	Carter looks around for Lee, catches a glimpse of the Eye in
	the Sky Room.  He grins.

				CARTER
		Check it out.  Catfight!

	POW!  He socks a GUARD in the face.

	INT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Isabella and Hu Li are locked in battle.  Rolling to the
	floor, they both see the gun.  They scramble over each other
	to get to it first.

	INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

	A security guard CLIMBS on the table to level Carter when Lee
	arrives.  He kicks the guard off and turns to Carter, his
	plea MUFFLED.

				CARTER
		What the HELL are you doing with tape on
		your face?

	No time to explain -- two more security guards arrive.  Kicks
	and punches fly, but Lee CAN'T GET HIT IN THE MOUTH!  He bobs
	and weaves, holding his hands to Carter to untie them in
	between swings.  Suddenly:

	BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  GUNSHOTS from the Eye In The Sky Room.

	Everyone HITS THE DECK.  Carter and Lee dive on to the floor
	as panic ripples through the Casino.  People FLEE for the
	EXITS.

	THE WAITRESS DESERTS HER TRAY.  It gets knocked over and TIPS
	on the floor.  The DETONATOR LANDS feet away from Carter.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		This can't be good.

	Lee's eyes BUG - he sees it too, feet STAMPEDING past it!  A
	high heel misses it by a fraction of an inch.  He LUNGES for
	it, manages to CRADLE it in his taped hands when --

	WHAM!  He is BUMPED and it FLIES AWAY.  The second it hits
	the floor, it is KICKED, skittering down the red carpet.

	ABOVE...the victor emerges in the Eye in the Sky Room.  Hu Li
	STEPS OUT on the PAGODA ROOF and JUMPS DOWN.  

	The DETONATOR ROLLS right past Hu Li.  As she bends to PICK
	up the detonator, Lee knows he won't get there in time. 
	Horrified, he SCREAMS at CARTER through the tape.

	Hu Li lifts the detonator.

	Carter finally pulls the TAPE OFF Lee's face.

	Lee SPITS the grenade into the air.

				LEE
			(diving on Carter)
		Bomb!!!

	Hu Li HITS the TRIGGER just as it lands on a roulette table.

	KABOOM!

	The table is BLOWN OFF IT'S FOUNDATION.  Chips and cash
	volcano.  Hu Li is blown backwards by the force of the blast. 
	SHEER PANDEMONIUM grips the casino.

	AS THE SMOKE CLEARS

	Carter and Lee peer out from behind a row of slot machines. 
	The place is deserted.

				CARTER
		Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in
		your mouth?

				LEE
		I did!

				CARTER
		No you didn't!

				LEE
		Yes I did.  I said MMMMMM!

	A hand on Carter's arm.  THIS IS SERIOUS.
			
						LEE (CONT'D)
		Ricky Tan is alive.

				CARTER
		What?!?!

				LEE
		We have to get to the Penthouse.

	Lee jumps up, SPRINTS toward the elevators at the dragon end
	of the casino.

				CARTER
		Hold on!

	Carter stuffs his pockets with chips, then races after Lee. 
	But halfway up the carpet.  Carter stops.  Lee turns to see
	what is holding him up.  

	Hu Li SURVIVED the blast and Carter has turned to face her.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		You go after Ricky.  I got this.

				LEE
		Carter...

				CARTER
		Just GO!

	Lee turns and runs off past the dragon.  Unfortunately, FIVE
	TRIADS block his path.  In a flurry of PUNCHES, Lee makes
	short work of them, and races toward the elevators.

	DEAD CENTER ON THE RED CARPET - HU LI AND CARTER FACE OFF!

	Each readying in their own manner.  Hu Li carefully wraps her
	long hair into a bun on top of her head.  Carter stretches,
	flexes, ready to sting like a bee.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		I'm not gonna hold you back this time
		just because you're a woman.  I'm gonna
		pretend you're a man.

	She pulls off her jacket, prepares to fight him in her
	undershirt.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		A very beautiful man with a perfect body
		who I'd like to take to the movies.

	She takes a sword from a Terra Cotta statue, SWINGS IT AROUND
	like a master.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		I may have been absent the day we went
		over this in karate class.

	Quick, Carter reaches for a fighting stick off a Terra Cotta
	soldier.  WHOOSH!  She SLICES IT IN HALF.  Carter reaches for
	another.  SLICE!  She's toying with him.

	INT. ELEVATOR BANK - NIGHT

	Lee's in the elevator as the doors close.  SUDDENLY, a HAND
	cuts through, parting the doors.

	It's ISABELLA!  A wound on her shoulder.

				LEE
		Are you okay?

				ISABELLA
		I'm fine.

	She steps in, too weak and starts to fall.  Lee grabs her and
	holds her in his arms.  HE gently helps her down.

				LEE
		I didn't know which side you were on.

				ISABELLA
		Now you know.

	DING!  The elevator doors open.  Isabella holds up a ROOM KEY
	- the key to the SUITE.  Lee takes the key, backs away and
	steps into the elevator.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		I'll try to get backup.  Be careful.

	The elevator doors close.
			
	INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - CONTINUOUS

	Steven Reign is closing the safe.  There are stacks of
	HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS on his desk, which he's putting in a
	black bag along with the plates.  As he turns around, he
	comes face-to-face with Ricky Tan.

				RICKY TAN
		American's love to gamble.  Don't they,
		Mr. Reign?

				STEVEN REIGN
		I'm cutting our deal short.  I'm
		leaving.

				RICKY TAN
		And my plates?

				STEVEN REIGN
		They stay with me.  I'm sure you won't
		have a problem with that.

	Reign shows Tan the gun in his belt.  Grabs the bag and
	starts to walk toward the door.

				RICKY TAN
		I enjoyed that little story you told
		about the Dragon and the treasure.  My
		mother used to tell it to me all the
		time.  Do you know the moral of that
		story, Mr. Reign?

				STEVEN REIGN
		Greed will imprison us all.

	Tan grabs Reign from behind and stabs him with a knife.

				RICKY TAN
		I hate that fortune cookie shit.

	Lee BURSTS through the suite door - watches as Reign falls
	dead to the floor.  Ricky takes the black bag off the desk.

				LEE
		Put the plates down.

	Ricky Tan looks down at the gun in Reign's belt.

	INT. CASINO - NIGHT

	WHOOSH!  Another Terra Cotta fighting stick is in half in
	Carter's hands.

				CARTER
		Will you STOP?!?!
			(picks up cocktail umbrella)
		What am I supposed to fight you with?

	No more toying.  Hu Li CHARGES Carter, who GRABS a ROULETTE
	WHEEL as a MAKESHIFT SHIELD.  She SLICES it in HALF!  He's
	got nowhere to hide.

	She JABS him with the sword.  Carter SCREAMS.  Falls back
	against the table, clutching his chest.  Hu Li WINDMILLS,
	kicking a Terra Cotta soldier on top of Carter, but --

	THWACK!

	The DOUBLE-BLADED BAMBOO POLE in its hand ricochets back and
	she is PIERCED THROUGH THE SHOULDER with the blade.  Staring
	at Carter in stunned disbelief, she drops to her knees.

	Carter walks toward her, considers his options, then KICKS
	HER IN THE HEAD, knocking her out.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		When are you people gonna learn?  Don't
		mess with the brothas!

	WEAK in the KNEES, Carter looks to the SOUND ON HIS CHEST. He
	reaches through the slice in his jacket.  Instead of a hand
	covered in blood, it comes out with a THICK WAD OF CASH!

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Thank you, Benjamin!

	Carter runs for the elevator.
						
				INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - CONTINUOUS

	Lee is walking toward Ricky Tan, the two men circling Reign's
	body.

				RICKY TAN
		You're just like your father, Lee.  All
		these years hiding behind his badge.  I
		wanted to help him, to share with him,
		but he was too afraid of change.  When
		you think about it, I didn't really kill
		him.  I just put him out of his misery.

				LEE
		Put the plates down.  It's over.

				RICKY TAN
		I don't think it's over.  There are
		casinos all over this country.  Let me
		make you a rich man, Lee.  Don't make
		the same mistake he did.

	Ricky glances at the gun in Reign's belt.

				LEE
		If you reach for that gun, I'm going to
		kill you.

				RICKY TAN
		Don't you remember?  I'm already dead.

	Ricky makes a play for the gun, but Lee is much too fast,
	taking the gun and pushing Ricky against the wall just as
	Carter bursts in the room.

				CARTER
		Hey, Ricky, how's it going man?  What's
		up, Lee?

	Lee has the gun pressed to Tan's head.  We've never seen him
	like this before.

				RICKY TAN
		Would you like me to tell you how your
		father died?

				CARTER
		Lee, you okay?

	Lee doesn't respond.  He keeps an eye on Ricky.

				RICKY TAN
		He never begged for his life.  Or tried
		to make a deal.  All that he asked me,
		just seconds before I pulled the
		trigger, was that I promise not to kill
		you.

	Lee's finger is on the trigger -- he wants to pull the
	trigger but can't.

				CARTER
		Lee, wait a second.  It's not worth it,
		man.  He's making you do this.

				LEE
		It's worth it to me.

				RICKY TAN
		Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you
		gonna spend the rest of your life hiding
		like your father?

				CARTER
		C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You
		won, now just put the gun down.

	Lee is trying to pull the trigger, but he can't.

				RICKY TAN
		That's what I thought.

	Tan takes the black bag and swings it toward Lee -- the
	plates hit him across the face and knock him down.

	THE GUN IS LOOSE

	Tan reaches for it and is about to pull the trigger when:

	Lee and Carter come flying at him TOGETHER.  Both KICKING HIM
	SQUARE IN THE CHEST.

	Tan falls back, SMASHING THROUGH THE WINDOW.  Lee tries to
	grab Tan's hand, their fingers touch for a split second.

	But Tan pulls his hand away and falls 20 STORIES to the
	street below.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	A TAXI is parked out front.  Tan's BODY SLAMS on the roof. 
	SMASHING THROUGH A SIGN ON TOP THAT READS: "EVERYBODY'S A
	WINNER!"

	INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - NIGHT

	Lee and Carter are looking down at the street, both relieved
	it's finally over.  Carter puts his hand on Lee's shoulder.

				CARTER
		I don't know about you, but I need a
		wine cooler.

	As they turn to the door -- Hu Li is walking toward them,
	bleeding and half-dead.  She has ANOTHER BOMB IN HER HAND. 
	This one twice the size of the one from earlier.

				HU LI
			(in Chinese)
		We'll go together, Inspector.

				CARTER
		Please tell me she just asked for a ride
		to the airport.

	Hu Li hits the switch - starts to smile.  Lee and Carter turn
	and RUN for the OPEN WINDOW.

	EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT

	Lee and Carter DIVE OUT THE WINDOW, grab a cable just as the
	PENTHOUSE BLOWS!

	The FIREBALL SHOOTS out as they start to slide down the side
	of the hotel.

	THEY SCREAM AS THE CABLE BREAKS.

	Lee and Carter SWING toward a HUGE "GRAND OPENING" BANNER. 
	They flip under it, do a loop before they SLAM AGAINST THE
	SIGN.

	It's KNOCKED LOOSE and they fall with it toward VEGAS BLVD.

	Lee and Carter hang on as they drop to the street.  A HUGE
	TRUCK speeds toward them as they hold on for their lives. 
	The entire STRIP SPEEDING toward them.

				LEE
		I can't believe I flew ten-thousand
		miles for this shit!!

	They lift their feet just as the TRUCK PASSES.  The sign dips
	and they fall straight down into the open sunroof of a LARGE
	STRETCH LIMO.
						
	INT. LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter land in the back.  Slam into their seats and
	try to catch their breath.  The TWO MEN STARTING TO LAUGH
	when they realize they're alive!

				CARTER
		We made it, man.

				LEE
		No problem.

	Lee and Carter look up to see the VERSACE SALESMAN and FOUR
	OF HIS FRIENDS sitting in the back of the limo staring at
	them.  The BOYS are all drinking champagne and dressed for a
	night on the town.

				VERSACE SALESMAN
		Well, there is a God after all.

	Lee and Carter exchange looks as the limo stops in front of
	the hotel.

				LIMO DRIVER
		Here we are.  The Red Dragon hotel.

	In front of the hotel WE SEE FIRE TRUCKS, AMBULANCE, POLICE
	CARS and Isabella and Sterling arresting TWENTY TRIADS.

				VERSACE SALESMAN
		We're all going gambling and then to see
		Siegried and Roy.  I hope you two are
		feeling lucky!

	INT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - NIGHT

	Lee is talking with a bandaged Isabella, who is standing with
	Sterling and several other SECRET SERVICE AGENTS.  Lee and
	Isabella hug goodbye.  As she walks off to board her plane,
	Lee slowly walks back to Carter who is smiling.

				CARTER
		I saw that.  She kissed you, didn't she? 
		You played it cool, though.  Walking
		away, never looking back.

				LEE
		She's going home to New York.  I need
		some ice.

	Lee and Carter watch as she gets on the plane.

				CARTER
		That your gate down there?

				LEE
		Yes.

				CARTER
		I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.

				LEE
		I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.

				CARTER
		You take care of yourself, Lee.

	Carter steps back, BOWS TO LEE.  Lee SHAKES CARTER'S HAND
	like a brother.  The two men smile.  Turn to walk away.

				LEE
		Carter, wait.  There's something I want
		you to have.

	Lee pulls a BADGE from his pocket.  Hands it to Carter.

				CARTER
		Your father's badge?  No way, man.  I
		can't take this.

				LEE
		It's okay.  I can finally let it go.

	Carter takes the badge.  Smiles.

				CARTER
		In that case, I got something for you. 
		I picked it up at the hotel.

	Carter pulls out a WAD OF CASH.

				LEE
		What is this?

				CARTER
		About fifty grand.  I won it at the
		tables.

				LEE
		No, Carter.  I can't take this.

				CARTER
		It's okay, I got lots more.

	Carter pulls out another wad of cash.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		They owe us, man.  That's the least they
		can do.

				LEE
		This money is evidence.

				CARTER
		Come on, Lee.  Stop being a cop for five
		minutes and live it up.  There must be
		something you want.

	Lee looks back toward Isabella.

				LEE
		I always wanted to go to Madison Square
		Garden.  See the Knicks play.

				CARTER
		New York City?

				LEE
		First class.

				CARTER
		The Plaza Hotel?

				LEE
		A little Mu-shu.

				CARTER
		Some Kung-Pao?

	They look at each other, smile.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		I could use a little vacation.

				LEE
		Amen to that, brother.

	As Lee and Carter start to walk away together, the MUSIC
	SWELLS.  "WAR" starts to PLAY.  They dance their way through
	a crowd of people, their arms raised as the two friends make
	their way through the airport.

          EXT. WHEAT FIELD - MORNING
          
          SAMANTHA DARKO (18) opens her eyes. She squints as the summer
          sun shrinks her pupils to pinhole size. She sits up slowly,
          looks around... and finds herself in midst of an endless
          wheat field.
          
          Sam is pretty and demure. Her coppery hair flows past her
          shoulders. Disoriented, she stands and gazes at the infinite
          golden shimmer. Amber waves of grain. Patches of forest in
          the distance. It's quiet. Serene. Beautiful...
          
          She smiles, and starts walking.
          
          
          EXT. ARKANSAS HIGHWAY 40 - MORNING
          
          She emerges at the shoulder of a rural stretch of highway in
          Arkansas. Adjacent to her position, on the other side of the
          deserted lanes, is a TRUCK STOP.
          
          
          EXT. TRUCK STOP - MORNING
          
          Amongst the TRACTOR-TRAILERS parked in the back lot is a
          white, late-80s model CHEVROLET CELEBRITY. Sam makes her way
          across the asphalt toward the vehicle...
          
          
          INT. COREY'S CHEVROLET - MORNING
          
          COREY RICHARDSON (18) is asleep, curled up in the reclined
          driver's seat of the car. She awakens when Sam gets in on the
          passenger side and slams the door shut.
          
          Corey has the look of a typical rebellious teen: dyed hair,
          piercings, a little grungy. She rubs the sleep from her eyes,
          greeting the new day with something less than enthusiasm. She
          finds a soft pack of CIGARETTES and lights one.
          
                              COREY
                    What time is it?
          
                               SAM
                    Early...
          
          Corey adjusts her seat. She takes a long drag and chokes,
          then spits out the window. She starts the car...
          
                                                                      2.
          
          
          I/E. COREY'S CHEVROLET/HIGHWAY 40, VARIOUS - DAY
          
          Corey's car cruises along the flat, open road. She cranks up
          the VOLUME on the car's CASSETTE DECK, nodding her head to
          early-90s ALT. ROCK (suggestion: Into Dust, by Mazzy Star)...
          
          Sam looks out the window at the passing scenery: FARMERS at
          work in the fields; a BILLBOARD advertising a local
          restaurant; ROADSIDE DITCHES filled with trash...
          
          She fixates on a MINIVAN travelling in the slow lane. It
          contains the all-American NUCLEAR FAMILY: MOTHER, FATHER and
          three SIBLINGS, one of them being a YOUNGSTER. The Youngster
          makes a face at Sam as they pass by...
          
          
          INT. COREY'S CHEVROLET - LATER - DAY
          
          Corey glances at the CONTROL PANEL when she HEARS the engine
          start to RATTLE. She sees that the TEMPERATURE GAUGE has hit
          the red and her CHECK ENGINE LIGHT is on.
          
                              COREY
                    Shit...
          
          
          EXT. OKLAHOMA HIGHWAY 40/COREY'S CHEVROLET - DAY
          
          By the time they pull over on the side of the empty highway,
          steam billows out from under the hood. Sam gets out of the
          car to check on it while Corey remains behind the wheel.
          
          Sam peeks under the hood, trying to clear the air of the
          steam. It sounds like someone is rhythmically TAPPING the
          inside of the engine with a hammer.
          
                              SAM
                    Turn it off.
          
                               COREY
                        (poking her head out the
                          WINDOW)
                    What?
          
                              SAM
                    Turn off the car.
          
          Corey does so.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    Doesn't look too good...
          
                              COREY
                    How do you know?
          
                                                                      3.
          
          
                              SAM
                    It smells funny.
          
          Sam looks up when she HEARS a PICK-UP TRUCK coming toward
          them. Corey watches as she steps out to wave it down...
          
          The pick-up pulls over ahead of them. CHRIS HOLT (24), a
          brawny, attractive young man, gets out. When Corey sees him
          she gets out too.
          
                               SAM (CONT'D)
                    Thanks for stopping. Our car's
                    messed up.
          
                              CHRIS
                    What happened?
          
                              COREY
                    My check engine light came on, then
                    it just started smoking, and
                    ticking and shit.
          
          As Chris pokes around under the hood, Sam and Corey exchange
          looks. Chris pops opens the COOLANT CAP and burns his hand on
          the steam explosion.
          
                              CHRIS
                        (shaking it off)
                    Blew your water pump. Can't drive
                    it.
          
                                 COREY
                    Fuck me...

                    El Reno's just a couple miles up
                    ahead. Can call for a tow there.
                    C'mon, I'll give you a lift.
          
          
          I/E. CHRIS' TRUCK/EL RENO, VARIOUS - DAY
          
          All three crammed into the cab of the pick-up, they drive
          through the center of El Reno, Oklahoma (population 16,000)
          and see some of the locals out and about [MUSIC MONTAGE
          fueled by early- to mid-90s era GRUNGE ROCK (suggestion: Come
          As You Are, by Nirvana) -- reminiscent of the `Middlesex
          Middle School Montage' in DONNIE DARKO]:
          
          AGATHA DOWDY (54), an employee of the local DINER, sits on a
          bench in front of the establishment smoking a cigarette. The
          manager, TED MONCTON (50), calls her back inside...
          
                                                                   4.
          
          
          RANDY EVANS (21), RUTH GIBBENS (18) and JEFF (21) and MIKE
          JIMENEZ (20) loiter in the parking lot of a LIQUOR STORE...
          
          TRUDY POTTER (39) flirts with FATHER HOMEIJER (54), a
          Catholic priest, outside the BANK. A BANK SIGN shows the TIME
          -- 12:00 PM -- then flashes to the DATE -- JUNE 18, 1995...
          
          OFFICER RYAN O'DELL (31) has pulled over a PRETTY LADY and
          uses his uniform to impress more than intimidate...
          
          They come up on VIETNAM TOM (48), who ambles along the side
          of the road against traffic, and he waves to them as they
          pass. He wears old, weather beaten clothes and a multi-
          colored SKI MASK over his head and face...
          
          [END MONTAGE]
          
          Sam swivels her head to watch Tom. ANOTHER CAR passes and he
          waves to it as well. Chris picks up on her curiosity.
          
                              CHRIS
                    He waves to everybody... Just kinda
                    walks up and down.
          
                              COREY
                    Resident nutcase?
          
                              CHRIS
                    People call him Vietnam Tom.
          
                              SAM
                    He was in the war?
          
                              CHRIS
                    He thinks he was... kind of a joke,
                    ya know?
          
          Sam continues to stare until he disappears out of sight...
          PAN DOWN to a PUDDLE by the side of the road. As a CAR TIRE
          splashes through it, PAN UP TO FIND:
          
          
          I/E. DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - AFTERNOON
          
          Dusty's auto repair shop, which is nothing more than a big
          garage attached to his old two-story house. Corey's car has
          been towed there, and DUSTY GIBBENS (37; father of Ruth
          Gibbens), the lone mechanic, tinkers around under the hood.
          
          Sam and Corey sit on the front steps of the house waiting,
          bored as hell. A PIT BULL laps at a nameless treat wedged
          into a crack in the walkway. The girls are forced to get up
          when Ruth (from outside the liquor store) comes to the door.
          
                                                                   5.
          
          
                              RUTH
                    Can I get out?
          
          Sam and Corey move so that she can exit the house. Ruth's
          look is hardened, rough around the edges -- she appears older
          than her 18 years.
          
          The girls watch as she enters the garage to see her father.
          She whispers something in his ear, and Dusty hands her some
          CASH, which she pockets then kisses him on the cheek. After
          this, Dusty wipes his hands on his greasy jeans and comes
          outside to address Corey and Sam.
          
                              DUSTY
                    Yeah... it's the water pump.
          
                              COREY
                    So what do we do?
          
                              DUSTY
                    I can order you up a new one.
                    Probably be a couple days.
          
                              COREY
                    Great. This the only show in town?
          
                              DUSTY
                    Cheapest and the best. But you want
                    me to call the tow guy back here,
                    no problem. Probably charge you
                    another hundred bucks, but he'll
                    get ya wherever you wanna go.
          
                              COREY
                    Just go ahead and fix it.
          
          
          INT. MOTEL LOBBY - AFTERNOON
          
          Phil Coulter (48), the proprietor of a dingy little roadside
          motel, looks up from a hardcover copy of Stephen King's
          GERALD'S GAME when the girls enter. They each have a SMALL
          SUITCASE and a BACKPACK in tow.
          
                              PHIL
                    What can I do for you?
          
                              COREY
                    We need a room.
          
          He gets out a notebook and lays it out on the counter. Corey
          finds a pen and starts to fill out a registration form... A
          NEWS BULLETIN about the O.J. SIMPSON TRIAL plays at a LOW
          VOLUME on a TELEVISION in the b.g.
          
                                                                    6.
          
          
                              SAM
                    How much is it?
          
                              PHIL
                    $39 a night. How many you stayin'?
          
                              COREY
                    Just a couple, we hope.
          
          He takes the KEY to ROOM 15 off the rack.
          
                              PHIL
                    Well... welcome to El Reno.
          
          
          EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT
          
          Sam and Corey arrive at the liquor store, which is down the
          street from the motel. Ruth, Randy Evans, and Jeff and Mike
          Jimenez are loitering in the parking lot in a similar fashion
          to how they were earlier in the day.
          
                              RUTH
                    You get checked into the motel
                    alright?
          
                              COREY
                    Yep.
          
          Randy seems surprised that Ruth has already made their
          acquaintance. He wastes no time in introducing himself.
          
                              RANDY
                    My name's Randy. This is Mike and
                    Jeff. Guess you already know Ruth.
          
                              COREY
                    Corey.
          
                              SAM
                    I'm Samantha.
          
          They shake, and Corey seems at ease mingling with the
          strangers. Sam hangs back a little.
          
                              COREY
                    One of you guys mind pickin' us up
                    a bottle of something?
          
                              RANDY
                    I think I can manage that. What do
                    you want?
          
                                                                      7.
          
          
                              COREY
                    I don't know. Vodka, whiskey,
                    whatever.
          
          Corey looks to Sam, who produces some cash. Randy takes the
          money and heads for the store.
          
                              RANDY
                    Be right back...
          
          After he's gone, there's an uncomfortable moment of silence
          in which Mike and Jeff ogle the girls mischievously. Ruth
          stares at them in a different way. She seems somewhat
          resentful of their presence.
          
                              RUTH
                    From Virginia, huh?
          
                                COREY
                    Yep.
          
                              RUTH
                    I saw your plates...
          
          Corey and Sam both nod in mundane acknowledgment. Another
          beat of uncomfortable silence.
          
                                RUTH (CONT'D)
                    Where to?
          
                                COREY
                    What?
          
                              RUTH
                    Your obviously just passin' through
                    here.
          
                              SAM
                    We're on the way to Vegas.
          
          Ruth snickers.
          
                              RUTH
                    Well... you need anything besides
                    booze, you just lemme know.
          
          Randy comes out of the store with a bottle in a brown bag. He
          passes it off to Corey, along with some change.
          
                              COREY
                    Thanks a lot, man.
          
                                                                      8.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    No problem. You guys wanna come
                    back to my place for bit? Bring
                    your bottle, we got some weed...
          
          Corey looks like she's considering it, but --
          
                              SAM
                    I'm really tired.
          
          She takes Sam's signal.
          
                              COREY
                    Yeah, I think we'll just head back.
                    Been a long day, ya know?
          
                              RANDY
                    That's cool.
          
          
          EXT. BANK - LATER - NIGHT
          
          The clock on the BANK SIGN shows 3:30 AM -- then flashes to --
          JUNE 19, 1995... It changes again, this time to a countdown
          to the JULY 4TH FIREWORKS CELEBRATION: 15 DAYS, 17 HOURS, 29
          MINUTES, 57 SECONDS... 56 SECONDS... 55 SECONDS...
          
          
          INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - NIGHT
          
          Sam awakens suddenly from a nightmare. She lies atop the
          blankets wearing a T-SHIRT and BOXER SHORTS. She looks over
          and sees Corey passed out on the other full-size bed.
          
          TWO PLASTIC CUPS, EMPTY SODA CANS, and the BOTTLE are on the
          nightstand between them, the liquor partially consumed.
          There's a digital CLOCK/RADIO that reads 3:30 AM.
          
          The TV is on, and a late night INFOMERCIAL for the GEORGE
          FOREMAN GRILL plays. Sam stares at the screen as the images
          WARP and RIPPLE in a way that coincides with an increasingly
          loud, rumbling TREMOR from outside...
          
          In a daze, she gets up and slowly walks closer to the
          television. She reaches out with her RIGHT HAND, about to
          touch it... A strange, abrupt HARD CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. GRASSY FIELD BEHIND MOTEL - NIGHT
          
          Sam is in a grassy field behind the motel, moving away from
          the building. She wears a HOODED SWEATSHIRT, JEANS, and her
          RIGHT HAND is wrapped in some sort of MAKESHIFT BANDAGE.
          
                                                                      9.
          
          
          There's a GASH in the side of her forehead by her temple,
          with what looks to be a SHARD OF METAL partially embedded
          under the skin and protruding from the wound.
          
          She is without expression, and her movements are rhythmic and
          fluid. A tall AERMOTOR WINDMILL towers in the distance...
          
          
          SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - THE GRASSY FIELD
          
          A glimpse of the field through Sam's eyes shows a
          phosphorescent PLANE OF DESTINY -- an intricate grid in which
          objects organic and inorganic dwell in assigned positions,
          and move according to a framework of set paths.
          
          A JACKRABBIT follows a silvery VECTOR SPEAR like prophetic
          life-gel to its burrow... COSMIC ENERGY burns around a
          CLUSTER OF STONES... Miniature VECTOR SPEARS lead a SWARM OF
          INSECTS around in a circle and then BUZZING right past Sam's
          field of vision...
          
          It's infinitely complex, but Sam sees through it clearly. She
          has no vector spear of her own to guide her, but she is
          cognizant of her path... She moves toward the WINDMILL.
          
          
          EXT. WINDMILL - NIGHT
          
          Sam appears at the foot of the windmill tower. A giant WATER
          TANK squats beside it. Remaining stoic, she looks up and sees
          Vietnam Tom sitting atop the windmill platform, more than 30
          feet up, staring back down at her through the eyes holes of
          his ski mask...
          
          
          ANGLE: WINDMILL PLATFORM
          
          Tom peers over the edge of the small platform, the surface of
          which is littered with TATTERED CLOTHING, a WATER BOTTLE,
          CANS OF FOOD and SCRAPS OF A TARP. He cradles a RIFLE in his
          arms...
          
          His focus shifts from what is at the foot of the windmill to
          what is sitting right beside him --
          
          REVEAL Sam. Her legs dangle over the side of the platform,
          and she stares off into distance.
          
                              SAM
                    The sky's so beautiful here...
          
          Tom looks in the direction that she stares and then back at
          her. Sam turns to meet his gaze...
          
                                                                     10.
          
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    But we can't stay.
          
          
          SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - VIETNAM TOM
          
          Sam sees through to the core of his physical being, the
          DYNAMIC CENTER of which lingers pulsating in a translucent
          circle around his chest.
          
          Magnified NEURONS in TOM'S BRAIN send ELECTRIC IMPULSES that
          release NEUROTRANSMITTERS, which excite OTHER NEURONS...
          
          Tom slowly reaches out to touch Sam, but an invisible FORCE
          FIELD makes contact impossible. RIPPLES swell throughout the
          clear plasma-like barrier from where he touched it, and his
          hand remains glued to the spot.
          
          Sam extends her bandaged right hand, and presses it to
          Vietnam Tom's as if she were touching a mirrored image of
          herself.
          
          The contact generates more RIPPLES, and as TREMORS begin to
          shake the windmill a DISTORTED VOICE echoes throughout the
          COSMOS:
          
                              DISTORTED VOICE (V.O.)
                    15 days... 18 hours... 45
                    minutes... 6 seconds. That is when
                    the world will end.
          
          A CYLINDRICAL PORTAL opens up below them, gaping and swirling
          like God's eye on the mouth of a liquid tornado. As Sam and
          Tom stand in unison to peer into it, a HEXAGONAL PLATE OF
          WHITE LIGHT emanates from within --
          
          
          EXT. BELOW WINDMILL - NIGHT
          
          They appear near the foot of the windmill, sprinting away
          from it together. Tom has his rifle, and he looks up to the
          sky as he runs...
          
          ...there's a brilliant flash of GREEN LIGHT -- deafening
          THUNDER -- a blinding EXPLOSION --
          
          
          EXT. BUS STOP - MORNING
          
          Sam awakens to the morning sun blinding her. She struggles to
          peer through the harsh whiteness at a looming figure that
          stands over her. Her eyes adjust to discover that it's a
          policeman -- Officer O'Dell.
          
                                                                     11.
          
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    `Fraid you can't sleep here, miss.
          
          Sam sits up and realizes she's on a bench at a bus stop near
          the side of the road. O'Dell's tone is innocuous, and when
          she looks up at him again she sees that he's grinning.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                    Got anyplace to be?
          
          Sam manages to find her voice.
          
                                 SAM
                    The motel.
          
          She takes his hand and rises.
          
          
          I/E. O'DELL'S CRUISER/MOTEL - MORNING
          
          O'Dell's cruiser pulls into the motel parking lot, which is
          uncharacteristically full. A FIRE TRUCK is parked by the side
          of the road. Just then, a call comes in on the POLICE RADIO:
          
                              DISPATCH (V.O.)
                    We got some kinda situation at
                    Frank Haley's farm...
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    Copy that. I'm here now...
          
          
          EXT. GRASSY FIELD BEHIND MOTEL - MORNING
          
          Where the towering windmill once stood is now only a CRATER
          about 5 feet deep and 10 feet in diameter, with charred bits
          of wood and metal strewn everywhere. GROUND WATER spurts from
          the broken WELL SEAL...
          
          And a cantaloupe-sized METEORITE sits in the center of the
          crater.
          
          Two FIREMEN haul out the meteorite with gloved hands as Sam
          and O'Dell arrive on the scene. Corey is already there
          looking on, as well as Chris Holt, who gave them a ride into
          town, Phil Coulter from the motel, and other local CITIZENS.
          FRANK HALEY (54), the farmer who owns the land, is fuming.
          
                              FRANK
                    Un-fuckin'-believable...
          
          The Firemen drop the porous, misshapen clod by his feet.
          
                                                                  12.
          
          
                              FIREMAN #1
                    It's still warm.
          
                              FRANK
                    You know how much it's gonna cost
                    me to replace this goddamn
                    windmill?
          
          Officer O'Dell steps up beside him and kicks the meteorite
          with his boot.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    Sell this thing off to some
                    meteorologist nerd club, I bet you
                    could do okay.
          
                                FRANK
                    Ya think?
          
          Sam looks down at a CAN OF FOOD on the ground amidst some
          scorched CLOTHING. O'Dell takes note of some other CANNED
          GOODS and SCRAPS OF TARP.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    What's all that stuff, Frank?
          
                               FRANK
                    That whack job Tom's been squattin'
                    up there the last couple a' months.
                    Thinks he's the goddamn town
                    watchman...
                        (BEAT)
                    You think he got blown up?
          
          Everyone scans the ground for signs of human remains until
          Phil pipes up:
          
                              PHIL
                    I saw him out in front of the motel
                    early this morning, alive and well.
          
                              FRANK
                        (SARCASTIC)
                    Oh, well, thank heavens...
          
          Sam turns and peers up at the WATER TANK. It's marred by BURN
          MARKS and DENTS from the explosion. As she tilts her head and
          looks closer, she can almost pick out a shape created by the
          damage -- a negative image like the Shroud of Turin...
          
          ...in the form of a bizarre, toothy-grinned FACE OF A GIANT
          MONSTER BUNNY.
          
                                                                  13.
          
          
          EXT. MOTEL - MORNING
          
          Sam and Corey are on their way back to the motel room when
          they turn and see that Chris has followed them.
          
                                 CHRIS
                    Hey...
          
                                 SAM
                    Hey.
          
                              CHRIS
                    So you guys stayed here last night?
          
                              COREY
                    One of us did.
          
          Sam gives Corey a look. Chris decides to ignore the comment.
          
                              CHRIS
                    What's up with your car?
          
                              COREY
                    It's gonna take a couple days.
          
                              CHRIS
                    For a water pump?
          
          Sam and Corey shrug.
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    None of my business, but...
          
          He's distracted when a brand new `95 BMW pulls up and parks
          nearby. JEREMY FRAME (25), a thin, pale young man hops out
          and hustles into the field toward the crash site.
          
                                 SAM
                    What?
          
          Chris regains his train of thought:
          
                              CHRIS
                    I was just gonna say, if you
                    wanted, I could give you a ride
                    back.
          
          He looks right at Sam when he says this. He then glances over
          at Corey, as if just remembering she was there.
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    You too. I mean, I could give you
                    both a ride.
          
                                                                    14.
          
          
                              COREY
                    To Middlesex, Virginia? Do you have
                    any clue how far that is?
          
                              CHRIS
                        (SHEEPISH)
                    I got some time...
          
          Sam looks as though she's about to say something but Corey
          overpowers her.
          
                              COREY
                    We're not goin' back. Even El
                    Reno's better than there.
          
          Chris makes eye contact with Sam again. She maintains it for
          a moment and then looks away.
          
          
          EXT. JUNKYARD - DAY
          
          Vietnam Tom explores a cluttered junkyard, gathering
          materials. He scours amongst the PILES OF REFUSE, RUSTY
          MACHINES and crumbling STORAGE SHACKS.
          
          He bends to pick up a SCRAP OF METAL and adds it to a
          collection he's making in a worn SATCHEL...
          
          
          EXT. DINER - DAY
          
          As Sam and Corey are about to enter the diner, Trudy Potter,
          a bank teller, is on her way out.
          
          The girls move to the side so she can exit, and take notice
          of a MISSING PERSONS SIGN posted next to the door -- BILLY
          MOORCROFT'S (10) dark, empty eyes stare at them from the
          BLACK & WHITE PHOTOGRAPH.
          
                              TRUDY (O.S.)
                    Isn't that just awful?
          
          Trudy has stopped and is looking over their shoulders.
          
                              TRUDY (CONT'D)
                    His poor mother...
          
          
          INT. DINER - DAY
          
          The girls sit at a booth, sipping Cokes.
          
                              COREY
                    How much money do we have left?
          
                                                                  15.
          
          
                              SAM
                    Not a whole lot.
          
                              COREY
                    I can't believe your fucking
                    parents wouldn't give you anything.
          
                              SAM
                    They totally flipped out that I was
                    even going. They weren't about to
                    give me money for the big trip.
          
                              COREY
                    We should've waited till the end of
                    the month when my mom gets her
                    check.
          
                              SAM
                    She wouldn't have given you
                    anything.
          
                              COREY
                    I know where she keeps her cash.
                    What's she gonna do, send her
                    boyfriend after me?
          
          Corey pokes at the crushed ice in her glass with her straw.
          
                               COREY (CONT'D)
                    Doesn't matter. As soon as we get
                    to Vegas, we'll be set. My cousin
                    said sometimes she makes two grand
                    in a week.
          
                                SAM
                    Jesus.
          
          Sam is impressed, but something about her subdued reaction
          exhibits reservations... Just then, Agatha Dowdy arrives with
          plates of BURGERS AND FRIES.
          
                              AGATHA
                    Here you go. Where'd you two say
                    you were from again?
          
                                SAM
                    Virginia.
          
                              AGATHA
                    You hear that, Ted?
          
          She calls to Ted Moncton, who is busy behind the counter.
          
                                                                  16.
          
          
                               TED
                    What?
          
                              AGATHA
                    These girls are from Virginia.
          
                              TED
                    I'll be damned. I'm from Reedville,
                    if you know where abouts that is...
          
          Neither Sam nor Corey give much of a hint as to a yes or no.
          
                              TED (CONT'D)
                    Well, have yourself some ice cream
                    when you're done, on the house.
          
                      COREY                               SAM
          Okay.                           Thank you.
          
                              AGATHA
                    Anything else you need, give a
                    holler.
          
          Agatha moves off, and Sam and Corey start to dig into their
          food...
          
          Momentarily, someone else enters and takes a seat at the
          counter by their booth. It's Jeremy Frame, the driver of the
          BMW. He raises a finger to alert Ted of his presence.
          
                              JEREMY
                    Just a coffee, please.
          
          Ted nods and pours him a cup... After he receives his coffee,
          Jeremy turns and stares at the girls. They both notice him
          doing it, but Corey is the first to speak.
          
                              COREY
                    Can we help you?
          
                              JEREMY
                    No, no... it's just that I
                    recognize you. I saw you by the
                    motel. Pretty amazing, huh?
          
                               COREY
                    I guess.
          
                              JEREMY
                    I just made a deal with Frank Haley
                    to buy it for seven-hundred fifty
                    dollars.
          
                                                                  17.
          
          
                              COREY
                    Whoop-dee-doo. What the hell are
                    you gonna do with a friggin'
                    meteor?
          
                              JEREMY
                    Meteorite, actually...
          
          Corey rolls her eyes at being corrected. Sam smirks and
          munches on a french fry -- she's enjoying their conversation.
          
                               JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    I'm gonna study it. I'm a grad
                    student at Redlands... we've
                    actually got a pretty cool geology
                    lab there.
          
          Corey focuses on her lunch, ignoring him, but Jeremy goes on.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    I've gotta do some tests, but if I
                    had to guess, I'd say it's a
                    siderite. They're composed
                    primarily of iron and nickel.
          
                                COREY
                    Have fun.
          
                              JEREMY
                    My name's Jeremy.
          
                              COREY
                    That's nice.
          
          Sam glances up at Jeremy, expecting him to be hurt or
          embarrassed by Corey's snub. But he's not. He's smiling at
          her, and she can't help but smile back.
          
          
          EXT. FATHER HOMEIJER'S HOUSE/CHURCH - AFTERNOON
          
          Each licking an ICE CREAM CONE, Corey and Sam walk past the
          home of Father Homeijer. The priest is outside working in his
          flower garden, wearing his CLERICAL COLLAR. An old CATHOLIC
          CHURCH rests on the same lot as his house, looming behind it.
          
          When Father Homeijer sees the girls walking by, he rises from
          his work, takes off his gloves and wipes sweat from his
          forehead. Sam and Corey both notice him eyeballing them.
          
                              COREY
                    What's his problem?
          
                                                                   18.
          
          
                              SAM
                    Just keep walking.
          
          Corey waves to him in a sarcastic, exaggerated manner... The
          priest doesn't wave back, but continues to gawk at them until
          they go around the corner.
          
                               COREY
                    Freak...
          
          
          EXT. JUNKYARD, STORAGE SHACK - AFTERNOON
          
          Vietnam Tom crouches in a decrepit SHACK covered by a piece
          of CORRUGATED ROOFING. He works with great focus, arranging
          VARIOUS BITS OF METAL into some sort of small SCULPTURE...
          
          
          EXT. LIQUOR STORE - LATER - AFTERNOON
          
          Having finished their ice creams, the girls pass the liquor
          store on the way back to the motel. They find Randy, Ruth,
          Jeff and Mike at their usual post.
          
                              RANDY
                    Hey, what's up?
          
                              COREY
                    Not much... just getting stared
                    down by creepy priest boy back
                    there.
          
                              JEFF
                    Father Homeijer?
          
                              MIKE
                    Don't worry, you're a little old
                    for his taste.
          
                              JEFF
                    Yeah, he's a fuckin' perv.
          
                              COREY
                        (to Randy)
                    You got an extra cigarette?
          
          Randy takes a pack from his pocket and offers her one.
          
                              RANDY
                    I'm throwin' a big party at my
                    house tonight, you guys should come
                    by. No excuses this time...
          
          Sam and Corey look at each other, considering.
          
                                                                   19.
          
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    You're gonna be stuck in El Reno,
                    you might as well have some fun,
                    right?
          
          
          EXT. RANDY'S HOUSE, BACKYARD - NIGHT
          
          The party at Randy's teems with LOCALS, ages ranging from
          early teens to late-20s. On the back deck is a KEG OF BEER
          and a BOOMBOX blasting MUSIC. There's a slimy-looking POOL,
          and a few people swim in the greenish water.
          
          Randy and Ruth make their rounds as a pair. They stop off so
          Ruth can sell a BAG OF WEED to some eager KIDS. Corey and Sam
          hang with Mike and Jeff, drinking beer.
          
                              COREY
                    You guys gotta come visit the club
                    when we get all set up. We'll give
                    you the VIP treatment, man...
          
          Mike and Jeff are both excited about this proposition.
          
                              MIKE
                    Sounds good to me.
          
                              COREY
                    Give us a little time, me and
                    Sam'll be runnin' that place, no
                    doubt... right?
          
                              SAM
                    Yeah. Definitely.
          
          Corey is relaxed, enjoying their newfound friends, while Sam
          appears more out of place. She drains the better part of her
          cup for some liquid courage.
          
          Randy and Ruth converge back on the group just as Officer
          O'Dell creeps into the backyard wearing plainclothes. Ruth
          notices him first.
          
                              RUTH
                    Fuck.
          
                              RANDY
                    What?
          
                              RUTH
                    That pig, O'Dell.
          
                                                                     20.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    Don't worry about Ryan. He might be
                    a cop, but he still likes to party.
          
          Randy's theory is proven when O'Dell takes a FLASK from his
          pocket and has a snort before approaching a pair of TEENAGE
          GIRLS... But Ruth is still not satisfied.
          
                              RUTH
                    I think that asshole knows I deal.
                    You know how fucked that is?
          
                              RANDY
                    From what I hear he's got a little
                    somethin' goin' on the side
                    himself.
          
                              RUTH
                    Fucking pig's a pig.
          
          They're all distracted when somebody does a cannonball into
          the pool and splashes them.
          
                      MIKE                               JEFF
          Fuck!                            Bastard!
          
                              SAM
                    What the hell...
          
          Sam bends to wipe some of the water from her pants. Ruth
          watches her, smirking.
          
                              RANDY
                    We might as well all go in now,
                    we're already wet.
          
                              RUTH
                    Good idea...
          
          Without warning, Ruth shoves Sam backwards into the pool --
          
          
          ANGLE: BENEATH THE WATER
          
          She sinks into the murky water in SLOW-MOTION. All SOUNDS are
          DROWNED OUT and everything is tranquil, completely detached.
          
          Through her blurred vision, Sam can see Randy's PORCH LIGHTS
          glimmering beyond the surface of the water... TRANSITION TO:
          
                                                                  21.
          
          
          INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
          
          The SPOT LIGHTS are blinding from the perspective of the
          STAGE. Through the WHITE BLUR an auditorium full of PEOPLE
          can been seen...
          
          In SLOW-MOTION and perfect synchronicity, YOUNG SAMANTHA (11)
          and the "SPARKLE MOTION" GIRLS are in the midst of their
          dance performance... BACK TO:
          
          
          EXT. RANDY'S HOUSE, BACKYARD - NIGHT
          
          A HAND reaches into the pool, grabs onto Sam's arm and pulls
          her up --
          
          She breaches the surface of the water, gasping for breath --
          back to reality. She sees that Randy is the one responsible
          for pulling her out.
          
                              RANDY
                    You fall asleep down there?
          
          He, Ruth and the others are looking down at her, laughing.
          Sam is lost in thought, struck by her vision...
          
          She snaps out of it when she sees Corey tear off her top and
          jump into the pool beside her. Many of the PARTYGOERS hoot in
          approval, and Randy, Mike and Jeff strip down and leap in
          right behind her.
          
          Sam swims toward the far side of the pool where the steps
          are, and fewer people. When she arrives there, she's
          surprised to find Chris Holt waiting for her with a towel.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Thought you could maybe use this.
          
          As Chris hands her the towel, he notices a wide SCAR on the
          inside of Sam's RIGHT WRIST... but doesn't mention it. Sam
          wraps the towel around her sopping wet body.
          
          Corey looks over and sees her getting out...
          
          
          EXT. RANDY'S HOUSE, PORCH - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
          
          Chris and Sam stand by the keg with fresh beers.
          
                              CHRIS
                    So what's so wrong at home that you
                    had to take off?
          
          The question takes Sam by surprise.
          
                                                                  22.
          
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    I'd love to get outta here someday
                    too... just don't know quite where
                    I'd go.
          
          Sam decides to open up a little.
          
                              SAM
                    I hate it there. It's like everyone
                    knows everything about me, but I'm
                    invisible at the same time. It's
                    like the worst of both worlds.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Small towns. How `bout your family?
          
                              SAM
                    They didn't want me to leave...
                    well, they did, but they wanted me
                    to go away to Harvard or something
                    like that, like my sister.
          
          Sam takes a big sip of her beer, showing signs of tipsiness.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    Sometimes I think it would've been
                    easier if... I just, after my
                    BROTHER-
          
          Sam stops herself.
          
                               CHRIS
                    What?
          
                              SAM
                        (changing gears)
                    That's why I love Corey, she just
                    doesn't give a shit. She does what
                    she wants and she doesn't care what
                    people think.
          
                              CHRIS
                    You just gotta be yourself, that's
                    all. What is it you wanna do
                    exactly?
          
                              SAM
                    I always thought I'd be a dancer,
                    like in a troupe or something...
          
          Sam is self-conscious after admitting this.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    That sounds kinda stupid probably.
          
                                                                   23.
          
          
                               CHRIS
                    No...
          
                              SAM
                    When I was younger, my dance team
                    was on Star Search.
          
                               CHRIS
                    Really?
          
                              SAM
                    Yeah... but I didn't go.
          
                               CHRIS
                    Why not?
          
                              SAM
                    I didn't end up dancing in the
                    talent show where they got
                    discovered... I didn't really feel
                    like it at the time anyway.
          
                               CHRIS
                    Huh...
          
                              SAM
                    But that's why we're going to
                    Vegas. There's lots of
                    opportunities there.
          
          Chris glances over to the pool where Corey is topless,
          splashing and goofing around with some BOYS.
          
                              CHRIS
                        (SMIRKING)
                    Yeah, good place for it. Gettin'
                    some practice on the way, too.
          
          Sam takes offense, getting drunk and sensitive.
          
                              SAM
                    Is that supposed to be like some
                    kind of judgement or something?
          
                              CHRIS
                    No, I was just-
          
          She takes her beer and storms away from him.
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    Sam, wait... hey, come on...
          
                                                                  24.
          
          
          EXT. RANDY'S HOUSE, SIDE ENTRANCE - NIGHT
          
          Sam finds a STOOP at the side of the house where she can be
          alone. She can HEAR the PARTY going on in the backyard, but
          no one else is in sight.
          
          Still soaking wet, she plants herself on the stoop and starts
          to pound the rest of her drink...
          
          A strange, abrupt HARD CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF RANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          Sam lies in the middle of the street in front of Randy's. A
          lone, flickering STREET LIGHT intermittently bathes her in an
          orange glow.
          
          She is completely dry, wearing her HOODED SWEATSHIRT and
          JEANS, with the MAKESHIFT BANDAGE wrapped around her right
          hand. The SHARD OF METAL protrudes from the GASH in her
          forehead...
          
          A CAR suddenly screams right past her prostrate form, missing
          her by inches. She sits up slowly and looks toward the front
          of Randy's house, which is about 20 yards away.
          
          
          SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - DRUNK GUYS
          
          Two DRUNK GUYS exit the house and enter the complex,
          phosphorescent grid that is Sam's field of vision. VECTOR
          SPEARS jut from their chests and precede all their movements
          as they open the gas tank of a PARKED CAR, insert a SIPHON,
          and begin to drain the gas into ANOTHER VEHICLE.
          
                              DRUNK GUY #1
                    Hurry up...
          
          Although she is close by, they take no notice of Sam
          whatsoever. ANOTHER CAR speeds by, again nearly crushing her,
          but she doesn't flinch...
          
          She stands, and turns deliberately to face the opposite side
          of the road where, unlike the Drunk Guys, there is someone
          who is completely focused on her -- Vietnam Tom crouches in a
          DITCH near a CULVERT --
          
          
          ANGLE: CULVERT
          
          Sam appears with him in the tenebrous ditch. Tom stares at
          her wide-eyed through the eyeholes of his ski mask.
          
                                                                    25.
          
          
          From one end of the broad, open culvert they can see straight
          through to the other side...
          
          A PORTAL starts to take shape within, swirling around the
          circumference. Soft, BLUE LIGHT touches their faces from the
          phosphorescent glow, and a gust of WIND is nearly strong
          enough to make them falter.
          
          On the opposite end of the culvert, a PLATE OF WHITE LIGHT
          flashes for an instant then transforms into an image of
          FATHER HOMEIJER'S CHURCH --
          
          
          EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT
          
          Tom and Sam stand outside the church. The STEEPLE reigns over
          them. Sam is stoic as she watches Tom climb the STONE STEPS
          and approach the great WOOD DOORS...
          
          
          INT. CHURCH - NIGHT
          
          Sam sits like a statue in one of the PEWS. Tom strides past
          her in a daze, moving toward the PULPIT...
          
          Beside the ALTAR stand THREE BARE CROSSES in imitation of
          Calvary, each standing over 4 feet tall.
          
          Sam looks up to a HIGH CORNER, above the pulpit to the right,
          where two walls and the ceiling meet...
          
          
          SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - CONVERGENCE POINT
          
          The three planes come together at an irregular angle, with
          the WALL ON THE RIGHT SIDE SLANTING INWARD, and the CEILING
          SLOPING SLIGHTLY DOWNWARD.
          
          PHOSPHORESCENCE burns in the three queerly pitches lines,
          with a concentration of heightened energy at the juncture.
          
          A VECTOR SPEAR bulges from Vietnam Tom's chest where he
          stands below it, reaching higher and higher...
          
          As Tom's SPEAR gets closer to the convergence point, the
          BIZARRE ANGLING becomes more exaggerated because the planes
          start to DIP and SWELL with impossible elasticity --
          
          
          ANGLE: BETWEEN THE WALLS
          
          Sam and Tom find themselves squeezed between the inner and
          outer walls. Claustrophobic, dusty and obscure.
          
                                                                  26.
          
          
          Dilapidated WIRING snakes around them, and Tom barely has
          enough space to reach forth and touch it with his finger...
          
          COSMIC ENERGY jolts through the WIRE. A SPARK. A BLUE
          FLAME...
          
          Heat and pressure build. The old dry wood begins to CREAK and
          SNAP -- FADE TO WHITE.
          
          
          OVER WHITE...
          
          The SHARP SOUNDS echo and fade away... then become present
          again. Louder now, and different. A BANGING...
          
          
          INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - THE NEXT DAY
          
          Sam pulls back the CURTAIN OF WHITE -- a SHEET over her face.
          She's lying on the floor of the motel room in between the
          beds.
          
          She's alone, and naked except for the sheet. Her WET CLOTHES
          are in a heap beside her. Her head is throbbing...
          
          BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!
          
          She scrambles to put something on so she can get the DOOR...
          
          
          I/E. MOTEL ROOM 15 - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
          
          Having thrown on some wrinkled clothes, Sam opens the door to
          find Phil, the motel owner. He does not look pleased.
          
                              PHIL
                    You plannin' on checkin' out today?
          
                              SAM
                        (GROGGY)
                    Uh... I, I don't know yet.
          
                              PHIL
                    Well, it's already way past
                    checkout time, so you'd better
                    figure it out quick.
          
                              SAM
                    I've just gotta find Corey... and
                    check on the car.
          
                                                                     27.
          
          
                              PHIL
                    You do whatever you have to, but if
                    you're stayin' another night I
                    wanna see some money up front.
          
          
          EXT. BANK - DAY
          
          Sam approaches the bank, and when she sees the tall SIGN with
          the digital clock, she stops and stares up at it. It strikes
          a chord but she doesn't know why...
          
          The sign reads 12:48 PM -- and then -- JUNE 20, 1995. It
          changes to the FIREWORKS COUNTDOWN: 14 DAYS, 8 HOURS, 11
          MINUTES, 22 SECONDS... 21 SECONDS...
          
          
          INT. BANK - DAY
          
          Sam enters the small bank, and as she approaches the counter
          she sees that Trudy Potter is in tears. Some of her FEMALE CO-
          WORKERS are consoling her.
          
                              TRUDY
                    I don't believe it... I still just
                    don't believe it.
          
                              FEMALE CO-WORKER
                    It's gonna be alright. You'll see.
          
          Trudy looks up and sees Sam waiting uncomfortably.
          
                              TRUDY
                        (dabbing at her eyes with
                         a tissue)
                    Can I help you?
          
                              SAM
                    Is everything okay?
          
                              TRUDY
                    No, it's not... Mount Calvary
                    burned to the ground last night.
          
                              SAM
                    Mount Calvary?
          
                              TRUDY
                    Father Homeijer's church.
          
                              SAM
                    Oh... How did it happen?
          
                                                          28.
          
          
                              TRUDY
                    The police are looking into it,
                    but... I know it was arson.
          
          Trudy leans in to talk quietly to Sam.
          
                               TRUDY (CONT'D)
                    It's no secret to me how people in
                    this town feel about Father
                    Homeijer. The horrible accusations
                    that have been made against him...
                    But it's just a lot of nonsense. El
                    Reno's changed so much since I was
                    a kid growing up here. The young
                    people nowadays...
                        (BEAT)
                    No offense.
          
          She places her hand on top of Sam's.
          
                              TRUDY (CONT'D)
                    But with all the drugs and the
                    crime... I just don't know what
                    this world's coming to anymore.
          
          Sam tries to redirect her focus.
          
                              SAM
                    Are you able to get money wired
                    here from my bank back home?
          
                              TRUDY
                    We don't usually work with other
                    banks like that.
          
                              SAM
                    I need to check my balance and get
                    my money out. How do I do that?
          
                              TRUDY
                    You'll have to call and arrange it.
                    You could always use Western Union.
                    Where's your bank?
          
                                SAM
                    Virginia.
          
                              TRUDY
                    Oh... `cause they're gonna need to
                    have a signature.
          
          Disappointed, Sam turns to leave...
          
                                                                  29.
          
          
          ANGLE: NEAR EXIT
          
          As she's on her way out, she notices a BULLETIN BOARD with
          another MISSING PERSONS SIGN for BILLY MOORCROFT.
          
          She stands before the picture, staring into the young boy's
          dark, empty eyes. Though it's just a low quality black &
          white photo, Billy's face emotes profound hopelessness and
          despair.
          
          
          EXT. BANK - DAY
          
          As Sam comes out of the bank Jeremy rolls up in his BMW and
          parks in the lot. He gets out and approaches her.
          
                                 JEREMY
                    Hi there.
          
                                 SAM
                    Hey.
          
                              JEREMY
                    I didn't get your name at the
                    diner.
          
                                 SAM
                    I'm Sam.
          
                                 JEREMY
                    Jeremy.
          
          They shake, and Jeremy holds her hand for a little longer
          than what is generally comfortable.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    So what are you up to?
          
                              SAM
                    Trying to get money... not very
                    successfully.
          
                              JEREMY
                    I've gotta pick up some cash too.
                    Need some supplies for the lab. I
                    don't think I've even slept since I
                    got my hands on that meteorite. You
                    should come by the lab with me and
                    check it out.
          
                                 SAM
                    I can't...
          
          Sam starts to walk away from him.
          
                                                                  30.
          
          
                              JEREMY
                    I could let you borrow some
                    money... if you need some.
          
                              SAM
                    I don't even know you.
          
                              JEREMY
                    That's okay. I trust you.
          
                              SAM
                    Thanks anyway.
          
                              JEREMY
                    You're sure you don't want to check
                    out the lab?
          
                              SAM
                    Sorry... I've gotta find Corey.
          
          Sam turns to leave.
          
                              JEREMY
                    Maybe some other time.
          
          
          I/E. RANDY'S CAR - AFTERNOON
          
          Corey rides shotgun in Randy's car, chewing on some greasy
          FAST FOOD, looking quite content. Randy is behind the wheel
          with a BEER in his hand, and Mike, Jeff and Ruth are packed
          into the back, passing around a JOINT.
          
                              MIKE
                    How many cheeseburgers did we get?
          
                              RUTH
                    Like eight.
          
          Mike passes the joint up to Corey and she takes a big hit,
          chases it with some beer...
          
                              JEFF
                    Wait, did we get smokes?
          
          Everyone in the car is stunned into momentary silence when
          they turn a corner and see what's left of the church.
          
                      MIKE                            RANDY
          Whoa!                           Jesus Christ...
          
                                                                    31.
          
          
          POV FROM THE CAR - THE CHURCH RUINS
          
          POLICE and FIREMEN swarm. Father Homeijer stands with Officer
          O'Dell, gazing at the soggy ruins. The only things standing
          amid the charred mess are the THREE BARE CROSSES of Mount
          Calvary. But they aren't completely intact --
          
          
          EXT. CHURCH RUINS - CONTINUOUS - ANGLE ON - DEFORMED CROSSES
          
          All three are bent drastically forward, sagging down toward
          the murky ground...
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (O.S.)
                    Musta' melted from the heat.
          
          Father Homeijer looks down at the metamorphosis, beside
          himself with bitterness and sorrow.
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                    They're made of silver-plated
                    steel. A simple fire couldn't do
                    that.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    What are you sayin'?
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                    This is an extension of Satan's own
                    hand... I've seen it coming.
          
          Rolling his eyes, O'Dell walks away, leaving the priest to
          grieve for his church in private.
          
          
          EXT. JUNKYARD, STORAGE SHACK - AFTERNOON
          
          Vietnam Tom continues to toil over his SCULPTURE, but
          progress has been made...
          
          It has begun to take on a recognizable form: a GROTESQUE
          COUNTENANCE with TWO LONG EARS, BULGING EYES and a devilish,
          TOOTHY GRIN...
          
          
          EXT. RANDY'S CAR/STREET IN FRONT OF DEPARTMENT STORE -
          AFTERNOON
          
          Sam is walking in front of a DEPARTMENT STORE when Randy's
          car pulls up beside her. Corey sticks her head out the
          passenger side window.
          
                              COREY
                    What happened to you?
          
                                                                   32.
          
          
                              SAM
                    What happened to me...? Where the
                    hell've you been?
          
                              COREY
                    I crashed at Randy's. We just got
                    food. Want a burger?
          
                              SAM
                    My stomach's fucked up.
          
                      JEFF                             MIKE
          Awww...                         Poor tummy...
          
          Jeff and Mike taunt her from the back. Ruth leers.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    We gotta talk about what we're
                    gonna do.
          
                              COREY
                    Don't worry about it so much.
          
                              SAM
                    The motel guy came to the room this
                    morning all pissed off. We're
                    probably not even gonna have enough
                    money to pay for the car.
          
          Corey sighs, debating weather or not to get out. Before she
          can reach a decision, something in the department store's
          parking lot catches her eye: a LITTLE BOY with dark hair,
          wearing a BIRTHDAY HAT...
          
          But she blinks and he's gone, having disappeared between two
          parked vehicles.
          
          Confused, Corey rubs her eyes and gets out of the car.
          
                              RANDY
                    Should I wait a minute?
          
                              JEFF
                    We gotta get some smokes...
          
                              COREY
                    Just go ahead. I'll catch up with
                    you later on.
          
                              RANDY
                    Alright. Later.
          
          Corey gets out and shuts the door. Randy speeds off toward an
          intersection about 20 yards ahead...
          
                                                                     33.
          
          
          INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON
          
          Chris is at work, stocking shelves inside the department
          store...
          
          He checks his watch, stops what he's doing and grabs a PACK
          OF CIGARETTES from his breast pocket -- time for a smoke
          break.
          
          
          EXT. INTERSECTION NEAR DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON
          
          Sam and Corey meander toward the intersection where Randy's
          car is stopped at a red light.
          
                              SAM
                    We just gotta figure out what we're
                    gonna do. I don't think-
          
                              COREY
                        (ABRUPT)
                    Lemme guess, you wanna go home.
          
                              SAM
                    What?
          
                              COREY
                    You wanna run back to mommy and
                    daddy and say sorry so they can put
                    you through college. Well that's
                    real big of you, Sam, but I don't
                    have that option.
          
                              SAM
                        (taken aback)
                    What are you talking about?
          
                              COREY
                    I'll go home and get the shit
                    kicked out of me, and get my ass
                    grabbed by my mom's boyfriend...
          
          They're almost to the light, which is still red, and coming
          up on Randy's car. Jeff, Mike and Ruth stare out at them from
          the backseat, smelling the drama.
          
                              COREY (CONT'D)
                    I knew you'd bail on me eventually,
                    but not this quick.
          
                              SAM
                    I'm not bailing on you. Would you
                    JUST-
          
                                                                     34.
          
          
                               COREY
                     You can fucking sleepwalk back to
                     Middlesex for all I care. I'm not
                     driving you... you're a fucking
                     drag.
          
          The light turns green, and Randy's car peels across the
          intersection, making a left...
          
                               SAM
                     Fuck you, Corey.
          
          Sam wheels on her and steps out into the street, storming
          straight across. Corey starts to follow... but something
          stops her in her tracks: BILLY MOORCROFT.
          
          He stands on the opposite side of the intersection, in the
          trajectory that Sam is walking -- but Sam doesn't see him.
          
          Billy wears a BIRTHDAY HAT, SLACKS and COLLARED SHIRT. He
          looks pale and weak, and is covered with BRUISES. He stares
          right back at Corey, as transfixed as she is... TIME SLOWS
          DOWN. [Note: Sam's position is in the middle of the road.
          Randy's car has made the left but is still in the vicinity of
          the intersection.]
          
          Bewildered, Corey tries to step out into the street but
          something blocks her -- an invisible FORCE FIELD makes
          forward progress impossible.
          
          RIPPLES swell like waves throughout the barrier where she hit
          it. She looks up, following the ripples with her eyes, and
          watches as they disappear beyond her realm of vision, into
          infinite space.
          
          She reaches forth with her hand, wanting to feel the barrier
          once again... Just as she touches it... REAL TIME RESUMES --
          
          KA-BOOM!
          
          FROM OUT OF NOWHERE AN OLD JALOPY SAILS RIGHT IN FRONT
          RANDY'S CAR! He jerks the wheel -- and the JALOPY hits on the
          front passenger side -- completely smashing it in --
          
          Sam spins when she HEARS the deafening CRUNCH...
          
          Randy careens into the opposite lane, and an ONCOMING CAR
          smacks him dead on. The inertia from the oncoming vehicle
          plows his car into a FIRE HYDRANT by the side of the road.
          
          The hydrant goes flying through the air like a bullet --
          
          -- AND STRIKES SAM RIGHT IN THE HEAD!
          
                                                                     35.
          
          
          The world goes SILENT.
          
          CHRIS RUNS TOWARD THE DESTRUCTION, DROPPING HIS CIGARETTE...
          
          WATER ERUPTS LIKE A GEYSER FROM THE PIPE WHERE THE HYDRANT
          USED TO BE...
          
          SAM'S BODY IS CRUMPLED IN THE STREET, MOTIONLESS...
          
          BILLY MOORCROFT IS GONE. THE FORCE FIELD IS GONE. COREY
          STANDS FROZEN, HORRIFIED... IN UTTER SHOCK.
          
          
          INT. POLICE STATION - AFTERNOON
          
          Corey signs her STATEMENT on Officer O'Dell's desk, the
          expression of shock still glued to her face. O'Dell sits
          facing her.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    You're sure you didn't see a
                    driver?
          
                              COREY
                    No...
          
          He takes the statement from her.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    Well, you're one lucky girl to have
                    gotten outta the car when you did.
                    Front passenger side was wiped
                    right out. Coulda' been two dead
                    girls today instead of one.
          
          Corey nods, taking this in.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                    I talked to Randy and sent him home
                    a little while ago. He's pretty
                    shook up.
          
          Corey doesn't respond. O'Dell leans in to speak to her in
          confidence.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                    Both of us know he'd been doin'
                    some drinkin' today. But we also
                    know he's not at fault here. That
                    old beater cut right in front him.
          
                              COREY
                    Can't you just look up the license
                    plates?
          
                                                                  36.
          
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    No plates on the vehicle. We're
                    investigating the VIN, but that
                    could take a little more time,
                    depending on the history of
                    ownership. We'll find him.
          
          Corey seems somewhat hesitant to bring up the next subject:
          
                              COREY
                    What about the missing boy?
          
          O'Dell shifts in his chair.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    You really think it was him, huh?
          
                              COREY
                    He was on the side of the road
                    right before the accident.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    I'm no psychiatrist, but I do know
                    sometimes shock does funny
                    things...
          
                              COREY
                    You think I was hallucinating?
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    We were on the scene five minutes
                    after the accident. I think
                    somebody woulda noticed a little
                    boy wandering around.
          
          He sees how troubled Corey is.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                    Why don't you stop in and see Dr.
                    Peters on your way out... right
                    down the hall there. She'll give
                    you somethin' to make you feel
                    better.
          
          Corey nods and gets up to leave. As she's on her way out,
          O'Dell's voice stops her.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                    Oh, uh... is there anything you
                    wanted to say to Samantha's
                    parents?
          
          Corey's expression is blank.
          
                                                                  37.
          
          
                                 COREY
                    Like what?
          
          
          EXT. POLICE STATION, BACK PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON
          
          Corey walks out of the police station and finds herself in a
          secluded back parking lot. She holds a PRESCRIPTION for anti-
          depressants.
          
          She is frightened when she notices a PAIR OF EYES staring at
          her from the bushes close by -- it's Vietnam Tom. He's
          wearing his ski mask and he's got his rifle.
          
          Corey backs away as Tom slowly creeps toward her... She's
          about to scream for help when Chris Holt comes out of the
          police station behind her.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Get the hell outta here.
          
          Grateful for his presence, Corey moves to stand behind Chris.
          Tom shuffles away.
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    Should know better than to be
                    carrying his rifle around town like
                    that...
          
          Corey takes a breath, recovering from her scare.
          
                                 CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    You okay?
          
                              COREY
                    What're you doing here?
          
                              CHRIS
                    I had to put in a statement too.
                    Can I give you a lift?
          
          
          I/E. CHRIS' TRUCK/MOTEL - EVENING
          
          Chris and Corey pull up to the motel in his pick-up. They've
          gotten Corey's prescription filled, and she has the BOTTLE OF
          PILLS in her hand.
          
                              CHRIS
                    I'm real sorry about Sam.
          
          Corey nods.
          
                                                                  38.
          
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    It's such a waste. Just a horrible,
                    freak thing.
          
                              COREY
                    I said some pretty shitty things to
                    her right before it happened.
          
                              CHRIS
                    I'm sure she knew you didn't mean
                    it.
          
          Corey gets out of the car and walks toward the motel room.
          
          
          INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - EVENING
          
          Corey swallows two of her PILLS with some liquor from a
          plastic cup. She sits down on one of the full-size beds where
          Sam's belongings are spread out.
          
          She opens Sam's backpack and discovers THE PHILOSOPHY OF TIME
          TRAVEL book, by Roberta Sparrow...
          
          As Corey studies the cover, her image is reflected by the
          CLOSET DOOR MIRRORS. The angle of the mirrors creates double
          image reflections for other objects in the room. Strangely,
          Corey's reflection is only present in one of the panes.
          
          The digital CLOCK/RADIO shows 6:30 PM...
          
          There are PICTURES of Sam's family tucked away inside the
          book, between the pages: Sam with her mother and father, ROSE
          and EDDIE DARKO; YOUNG SAM with ELIZABETH and DONNIE; an old
          photo of the whole Darko family together -- Young Sam holds
          ARIEL, a STUFFED TOY UNICORN.
          
          Corey removes the pictures and sets them on the nightstand...
          She then looks down and notices that the book is open to:
          CHAPTER THREE - THE FRAGMENTARY UNIVERSE.
          
                              COREY
                    Fragmentary Universe...
          
          She pours over the text, some of which reads: When the fabric
          of the fourth dimension within a Tangent Universe becomes
          corrupted, a highly unstable and volatile Fragmentary
          Universe can occur, sustaining itself for no longer than
          several days... FADE TO BLACK.
          
                                                                    39.
          
          
          INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - LATER - NIGHT
          
          Corey awakens to the sound of a little boy CRYING. She sits
          up in bed. The clock/radio reads 3:30 AM. The CRYING is faint
          but steady and sorrowful, and sounds as though it's coming
          from outside...
          
          
          EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT
          
          Corey follows the distinctive CRYING toward the VENDING
          MACHINES on the side of the building...
          
          ...until Billy Moorcroft emerges from behind them. Corey
          freezes a few feet away from the boy, who wears the BIRTHDAY
          HAT, SLACKS and COLLARED SHIRT. He is pale and bruised.
          
          Corey sees that he is not crying -- it's coming from
          elsewhere in the cosmos, far away. The WAILS taper off to a
          faint, DISTORTED WHISPER as Billy speaks:
          
                              BILLY MOORCROFT
                    You need to save me, Corey.
          
          Corey stares at him in disbelief.
          
                              BILLY MOORCROFT (CONT'D)
                    You need to save me... and save the
                    world.
          
                              COREY
                    Why can't anyone see you?
          
                              BILLY MOORCROFT
                    If you tell them about me they'll
                    think you're a dummy.
          
                               COREY
                    Why me?
          
                              BILLY MOORCROFT
                    I didn't pick you. Just like you
                    didn't pick me either.
          
          Corey stands before him in awe, transfixed.
          
                              BILLY MOORCROFT (CONT'D)
                    We shouldn't even be here. Nobody
                    should...
          
          Corey takes notice of the vending machines behind him. Where
          the prices should be, NUMBERS flash in a rhythm that seems to
          coincide with the ululations of the distant CRYING: 2...
          10... 16... 44... -end-... 2... 10... 16... 44... -end-...
          
                                                                     40.
          
          
                              BILLY MOORCROFT (CONT'D)
                    You don't have much time.
          
          Corey is about to respond when the sound of a DOOR OPENING
          stops her. The FLASHING NUMBERS on the vending machines go
          back to normal PRICES, the CRYING SOUND CEASES, and Billy
          disappears.
          
                              PHIL (O.S.)
                    What's goin' on out here?
          
          Corey looks over and sees Phil dressed in nightclothes,
          having come out of a room near the lobby. She's dumbstruck.
          
                              COREY
                    Nothing... I-I don't know.
          
                              PHIL
                    Go back to your room and get some
                    sleep. You've had a tough day.
          
          Phil goes back inside, leaving her alone.
          
          
          INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
          
          Corey wanders through the aisles of the department store,
          looking peaked and jittery. She comes upon Chris stocking
          some shelves near the back of the store.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Hey... how ya feelin'?
          
                              COREY
                    Not so good.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Is there anything I can do?
          
                              COREY
                    I need some cigarettes... and maybe
                    some food. But I don't really have
                    any money right now.
          
                               CHRIS
                    I'm off at 3:30. Meet me out behind
                    the store.
          
          
          EXT. BEHIND THE DEPARTMENT STORE - LATER - AFTERNOON
          
          Corey waits on the cement steps by the loading dock. She
          shoots up when Chris comes out the back entrance with a
          PLASTIC BAG...
          
                                                                  41.
          
          
          Corey takes it from him and looks inside: CANDY BARS, a BAG
          OF CHIPS, some PEANUTS, a pack of CIGARETTES.
          
                              COREY
                    Thanks.
          
          She tears open the cigarettes and lights one. Chris lights up
          one of his own, and notices Corey's hands are shaking.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Shouldn't you go back home?
          
                              COREY
                    There's nothing for me to go home
                    to. Trust me.
          
                              CHRIS
                    What about Sam's funeral?
          
          Corey looks conflicted, but she takes a harsh stance:
          
                              COREY
                    What's the point? She's gone,
                    that's it. Nothing's gonna change
                    that...
          
          Chris lets it go.
          
                              COREY (CONT'D)
                    Is there a library around here?
          
                              CHRIS
                        (PUZZLED)
                    Yeah... you need a book?
          
                              COREY
                    Is it walking distance?
          
                              CHRIS
                    I can take you.
          
                              COREY
                    I think I'd rather walk.
          
          
          EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON
          
          Corey and Chris stroll together along a quiet street.
          
                              CHRIS
                    So you guys were real close, huh.
          
                                                                  42.
          
          
                              COREY
                    When I moved to Virginia Sam was
                    like the only person I could even
                    stand to talk to.
          
                              CHRIS
                    How long had you been plannin' your
                    trip together?
          
                              COREY
                    Not too long... kind of a last
                    minute thing. It was good timing,
                    `cause I don't like to stay in one
                    place for too long, ya know?
          
                              CHRIS
                    Huh...
          
                              COREY
                    I was really surprised when Sam
                    wanted to come, actually. I just
                    kinda brought it up one day, and
                    she was down...
          
          Corey reflects for a beat.
          
                              COREY (CONT'D)
                    If it wasn't for me, she'd still be
                    alive right now.
          
                              CHRIS
                    You can't think like that.
          
                              COREY
                    It's true, isn't it?
          
          Chris doesn't respond.
          
          
          INT. LIBRARY, MICROFICHE RESEARCH BOOTH - AFTERNOON
          
          Corey and Chris sit before a screen in a cramped, dim booth
          near the back of the library. They stare at a MICROFILM
          ARTICLE from 1988 about DONNIE DARKO'S DEATH.
          
                              CHRIS
                    That was Sam's brother?
          
                              COREY
                    Yeah.
          
          On the screen is a PHOTOGRAPH of the DARKO HOUSE with many
          PEOPLE gathered in front of it. A JET ENGINE is being lifted
          away by a CRANE.
          
                                                                  43.
          
          
                              CHRIS
                    Her parents must be going through
                    hell.
          
                              COREY
                    Sam said once she wished it landed
                    on her room instead of Donnie's.
          
          Chris thinks on this.
          
                              CHRIS
                    I saw something on Sam's wrist the
                    other night... it looked like a
                    scar.
          
                              COREY
                    She told me it was from some
                    accident. Put her hand through a
                    window or something.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Did you believe her?
          
          Corey doesn't answer. She pulls up ANOTHER ARTICLE, one that
          chronicles a MAN who was IMPALED BY A METAL PIPE with no
          known origin...
          
          A THIRD ARTICLE is about a LITTLE GIRL who was DECAPITATED BY
          A MANHOLE COVER that was inexplicably flying through the
          air...
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    God...
          
          Chris is horrified. Corey is totally engrossed.
          
          She brings up a FINAL ARTICLE that tells the story of a BOY
          who was CRUSHED BY A DUMPSTER that fell from the sky. A
          PICTURE shows his legs sticking out from under it like the
          Wicked Witch of the East when Dorothy's house fell on her in
          Munchkinland.
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    I don't understand why we're
                    lookin' at this stuff.
          
                              COREY
                    They still never found a driver to
                    that car that hit Randy... I was
                    standing right there. I didn't see
                    anyone.
          
                                                                  44.
          
          
                              CHRIS
                    I was pretty close too, but
                    everything was all crazy. Whoever
                    it was must've jumped out and took
                    off.
          
                              COREY
                    I found this book in Sam's backpack
                    last night. There's a chapter where
                    it talks about stuff like this
                    happening. Like a guy being killed
                    by an arrow that nobody shot, and a
                    swordsmith getting killed by a
                    sword he hadn't made yet.
                    Unexplainable things, but it says
                    there's a reason why they happen.
          
                              CHRIS
                    A book...? I don't get what your
                    talkin' about. What was the reason?
          
                              COREY
                    It didn't say.
          
          Corey thinks, trying to figure out the right way to express
          something...
          
                              COREY (CONT'D)
                    Last night, and right before the
                    accident, I saw...
          
                               CHRIS
                    What?
          
                               COREY
                    Nothing.
          
          Corey sighs and turns back to the screen.
          
                              COREY (CONT'D)
                    You already think I'm a freak show.
          
          
          INT. LIBRARY, FRONT DESK - AFTERNOON
          
          As Chris and Corey are on the way out, they notice Jeremy
          Frame at the counter checking out a STACK OF BOOKS.
          
          In putting them down, he accidentally drops half of them onto
          the floor. He looks frazzled as he begins to pick them up,
          and he scratches compulsively at his LEFT FOREARM...
          
                                                                  45.
          
          
          I/E. DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - AFTERNOON
          
          Chris and Corey pull up to Dusty's auto repair shop in Chris'
          truck.
          
          They get out and start to walk up to the garage, but they're
          cut off by the unchained PIT BULL -- it's growling and
          barking in a frenzy --
          
                                RUTH (O.S.)
                    Darielle!
          
          The dog heels at the sound of the voice, and Ruth bolts out
          of the house and takes her by the collar. She's got a bandage
          over a cut on her forehead.
          
                              RUTH (CONT'D)
                    Come to check on your car?
          
                                COREY
                    Yeah...
          
          Hearts still thumping in their chests, they follow Ruth into
          the garage... COREY'S CHEVROLET is parked in the same spot it
          was when she left it the other day. The hood is propped open.
          
                              RUTH
                    Randy's been a wreck since the
                    accident.
          
                              CHRIS
                    He should be. He was driving around
                    shit-faced and somebody got killed.
          
                              RUTH
                    You can just fuck off...
          
          She gets right up in his face with such intensity that Chris
          retreats a step or two.
          
                              RUTH (CONT'D)
                    Prima donna motherfucker think your
                    shit don't stink?
          
          Corey steps in:
          
                              COREY
                    She's right...
          
          Chris gives her a look.
          
                              COREY (CONT'D)
                    I mean, there's nothing Randy
                    could've done.
          
                                                                  46.
          
          
          Ruth turns and goes into the house through a GARAGE ENTRANCE.
          
                              RUTH
                    I'll get my dad.
          
          The door slams shut behind her, and Corey and Chris glance at
          each other...
          
          Momentarily, Dusty comes out, a partially eaten SANDWICH in
          hand.
          
                              DUSTY
                    Got some bad news for you...
          
          He walks them over to the car, finishing off his sandwich and
          wiping his hands on his greasy jeans.
          
                              DUSTY (CONT'D)
                    Your engine seized up when your
                    water pump blew.
          
                              COREY
                    I need a new engine now?
          
                              DUSTY
                    I can get one in there for you.
                    Cost you about fifteen hundred.
          
          Corey's face drops.
          
                              COREY
                    I don't have anywhere near that
                    much money.
          
                              CHRIS
                    That's probably as much as the
                    car's worth.
          
                              DUSTY
                    I understand. But, I already
                    ordered the water pump, and I'll
                    have to get paid for my time. That
                    comes to about three-hundred total.
          
                              COREY
                    I don't have that much either.
          
          Dusty is perturbed.
          
                              DUSTY
                    You think I do this for charity?
          
                                                                   47.
          
          
                              CHRIS
                    You didn't do anything. What's she
                    want a water pump for if she
                    doesn't have an engine?
          
                              DUSTY
                    I see how it is... couple a' punks.
                    You don't plan to pay what you owe,
                    you can get the hell off my
                    property right now.
          
          Corey glares at him, furious, but Chris takes her by the arm.
          
                              COREY
                        (under her breath)
                    Asshole.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Let's go...
          
          
          I/E. CHRIS' TRUCK/MOTEL - AFTERNOON
          
          Chris' truck pulls up in front of the motel and parks. At the
          same time, Father Homeijer and Trudy come out of the FRONT
          OFFICE carrying a COLLECTIONS JAR.
          
          As they approach the truck Chris slowly rolls down the
          window.
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                    Good afternoon.
          
                              TRUDY
                    We're taking collections to help
                    rebuild Mount Calvary after the
                    tragic fire.
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                    Any small amount you could manage
                    would really help.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Sorry.
          
          Father Homeijer and Trudy look over to Corey in the passenger
          seat but she just stares back at them.
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                    God bless you.
          
          They turn and walk away, and Chris rolls his window back up.
          
                                                                    48.
          
          
                              CHRIS
                    Everybody wants somethin'...
          
                              COREY
                    What about you?
          
                              CHRIS
                    What do you mean?
          
                              COREY
                    You wouldn't give me stuff and
                    drive me around if you didn't want
                    something in return.
          
                               CHRIS
                    Why not?
          
                              COREY
                    `Cause that's just not how it
                    works.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Maybe you're wrong about that.
          
          Corey nods, but still doesn't believe him.
          
                               COREY
                    See ya.
          
          She gets out, and Chris eyes her as she walks to her room.
          
          
          INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - NIGHT
          
          Corey lays on her stomach in bed, her head buried in The
          Philosophy of Time Travel book. The TELEVISION is on in the
          b.g. (out of focus), playing a repeat of the FOREMAN GRILL
          INFOMERCIAL...
          
          Suddenly, there is a slight TREMOR from outside and RIPPLE
          runs over the TV screen.
          
          Corey looks around, taking no notice of the odd change on the
          television -- instead of GEORGE FOREMAN'S VOICE, HULK HOGAN
          is HEARD promoting the brand new HULKSTER GRILL...
          
          Just then, there is a KNOCK at the door. She gets up to
          answer it and finds Randy -- he looks distraught.
          
                              RANDY
                    Do you hate me?
          
                               COREY
                    Huh?
          
                                                                     49.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    You think it's my fault she's dead.
          
                              COREY
                    No...
          
                              RANDY
                    You mean it?
          
                              COREY
                    Yeah... it wasn't your fault.
          
          Randy sighs as if a big weight has been lifted.
          
                              RANDY
                    What's that?
          
          Corey looks down and realizes that she's still holding The
          Philosophy of Time Travel book in her hand.
          
                              COREY
                    Oh, it's just... something of
                    Sam's.
          
          Randy nods. Corey tosses the book onto the bed.
          
                              RANDY
                    You wanna get outta here for a
                    while? I got my dad's car.
          
          
          I/E. RANDY'S DAD'S CAR/LOOKOUT - NIGHT
          
          RANDY'S DAD'S CAR navigates a DIRT ROAD up a WOODED HILL to a
          VANTAGE POINT where the whole of El Reno can be seen. SPARSE
          LIGHTS flicker over about 80 square miles of civilization.
          
          There are a few OTHER VEHICLES parked at the lookout, most
          containing COUPLES with MUSIC playing low.
          
          Randy pulls into a more SECLUDED CLEARING, away from the
          other cars but still with a nice view.
          
                              RANDY
                    I've been comin' up here since I
                    was a kid. Good place when you
                    wanna just get away from
                    everything.
          
          Randy pushes in a TAPE (suggestion: River of Deceit, by Mad
          Season), then takes a JOINT from his pocket and sparks it up.
          
                              COREY
                    Is Ruth your girlfriend?
          
                                                             50.
          
          
          Randy passes the joint to Corey and she hits it.
          
                              RANDY
                    Naw, we're just friends. She's
                    pretty weird sometimes. Too like...
                    intense, or something.
          
                              COREY
                    Seems like you guys are pretty
                    close.
          
                              RANDY
                    Yeah... don't worry about Ruth.
          
          Randy takes another hit and holds it in.
          
                              COREY
                    Do you ever have a hard time
                    telling what's real and what's not
                    real?
          
          Randy exhales and looks over at her, perplexed.
          
                              RANDY
                    Sometimes... sometimes something
                    can feel really real, but it's just
                    your mind playing tricks on you.
          
                              COREY
                    I've got so much shit in my head
                    right now... I've never felt so
                    outta control. I think I'm really
                    goin' psycho.
          
          He passes her the joint.
          
                              RANDY
                    I got some acid from my buddy one
                    time... this like flying eagle
                    pyramid shit. I took two hits, and
                    man... next thing I knew I was on
                    the floor, curled up in ball, and
                    Mike and Jeff were just standing
                    there lookin' down at me. I could
                    see this like glowing grid cutting
                    through my brain, and I knew when
                    it got all the way through I'd be
                    this sketched out vegetable. I
                    could picture my dad staring down
                    at me in the hospital in my
                    straightjacket, crying and shit...
          
          Corey blows out a hit, captivated...
          
                                                                   51.
          
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    The whole time my esophagus was
                    like twisting and turning in my
                    throat and cutting off my air
                    supply... it was terrible.
          
                              COREY
                    Jesus.
          
                              RANDY
                    I can still slip back into it
                    sometimes, but I know now that my
                    brain is what's making it real...
                    and that's like a blessing and a
                    curse, man, `cause that means you
                    have to decide what's real and
                    what's not.
          
                              COREY
                    The things that feel the most real
                    right now are... impossible. More
                    like a dream.
          
          Corey passes him the joint and he stamps out the roach in the
          car's ashtray.
          
                              RANDY
                    I know what you mean. The scariest
                    part is thinking you're not the
                    same person anymore. Something's
                    changed... like your identity.
          
                              COREY
                    What if the change is for the
                    better?
          
          Randy finds an INHALER in his pocket and takes a puff.
          
                              RANDY
                    That's fucked up.
          
                              COREY
                    I don't think I even care if I'm
                    crazy.
          
          Corey turns and looks into his eyes. Randy leans forward...
          They're about to kiss, when --
          
                              COREY (CONT'D)
                    What the fuck?
          
          A DARK SHAPE scurries to an enclosed area at the edge of the
          forest where there's a TARP, some WATER BOTTLES, CANS OF FOOD
          and a RIFLE...
          
                                                                    52.
          
          
          It's Vietnam Tom, and he's brought some supplies to his NEW
          SQUATTING GROUND.
          
                              COREY (CONT'D)
                    That fucking guy again...
          
          Randy and Corey both laugh, relieving the tension. But Tom's
          proximity has spoiled the mood.
          
                              RANDY
                    Let's get outta here.
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Mike, Jeff and Ruth sit on a ratty couch in Randy's living
          room, watching BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD on MTV. Some EMPTY BEER
          CANS and a HOMEADE BONG litter a coffee table. When the FRONT
          DOOR OPENS and Corey and Randy enter, none of them budge.
          
          As Corey and Randy walk to Randy's bedroom, Ruth follows them
          with her eyes...
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Randy shuts the door to his messy room. A TAPESTRY hangs from
          the ceiling. Corey is drawn to a DESK next to the bed. Above
          it is a DEATH SHRINE to KURT COBAIN -- MAGAZINE CUTOUTS,
          POSTERS and TICKET STUBS arranged decoratively.
          
          A large BLACK & WHITE POSTER showing a CLOSE   UP of COBAIN'S
          FACE is the centerpiece, and a sloppy BULLET   HOLE drawn in
          RED MARKER marks the center of his forehead.   The words `I'M
          NOT AFRAID OF DYING' are scrawled across the   bottom of the
          poster in the same BRIGHT RED.
          
                              COREY
                    This is cool.
          
                              RANDY
                    Thanks.
          
          Randy puts his hands on her hips, running them up her torso.
          Corey turns to face him...
          
          They kiss...
          
          ...and fall back onto the bed...
          
                                                                     53.
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - LATER - NIGHT
          
          A DIGITAL CLOCK on Randy's DESK shows 3:30 AM. There's a
          SLIGHT TREMOR and the numbers shift, changing briefly to
          01:10:23:08, then back again to 3:30.
          
          Corey wakes suddenly from a nightmare. She sits up and looks
          around, remembering where she is. She discovers Randy asleep
          by her side. She finds a pile of clothes on the floor beside
          the bed and grabs her shirt...
          
          ...after she pulls it on over her head, she freezes --
          because Billy Moorcroft is standing right there in his
          BIRTHDAY HAT, staring at her.
          
                              BILLY MOORCROFT
                    Only one day left.
          
          Corey turns and looks down to Randy. He's still fast asleep.
          
                              COREY
                    What am I supposed to do?
          
          As soon as she utters her question she notices a silvery,
          liquid VECTOR SPEAR protruding from the center of her chest.
          
          Billy is now gone, but her SPEAR beckons her out of the room,
          elongating to illustrate her path. Corey is in awe...
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Her SPEAR leads her through the living room, and past the
          sleeping bodies of Mike, Jeff and Ruth. Following her path
          leads her to step on RUTH'S FOOT as she goes by...
          
          Corey doesn't even notice, but one of Ruth's eyes pop open as
          she treads out the door...
          
          
          EXT. STREET - NIGHT
          
          Corey follows Billy, who walks in the middle of the road
          about 15 yards ahead of her. The residential street is
          guarded by great, OLD TREES on either side.
          
          The dark sky above starts to BEND and WARP, and a BUCKLE in
          space-time materializes.
          
          There's a simultaneous flash of LIGHTING and sharp CRACK OF
          THUNDER, and Corey looks up to the VORTEX -- a massive,
          swirling MAELSTROM gapes open like a tunnel to the inter-
          dimensional realm of darkest night.
          
                                                                     54.
          
          
          The VOID brightens, and ominous STORM CLOUDS and TORRENTIAL
          RAINS are visible within...
          
          Corey peers up into the MOUTH of it and sees DUSTY'S HOUSE
          AND AUTO REPAIR SHOP being doused and beaten by the STORM --
          
          
          INT. DUSTY'S GARAGE - NIGHT
          
          In contrast to the street, all is nearly SILENT in Dusty's
          garage. Corey watches as Billy moves along the perimeter
          WITHOUT SOUND, ghostly... JUMP CUTS and TIME CUTS.
          
          Her CHEVROLET sits in the bay. Some of the PARTS have already
          been harvested -- the CATALYTIC CONVERTER sits next to it on
          the floor.
          
          Corey approaches a UTILITY SINK next to a SHOWER in the
          corner...
          
                              BILLY MOORCROFT
                    You can do it.
          
                                 COREY
                    How?
          
                                 BILLY MOORCROFT
                    It's easy.
          
          Corey focuses on the sink, and it begins to tremble. The
          pipes beneath it CREAK and MOAN. WATER starts to bubble up
          from the sink drain, also in the shower...
          
          Billy stands atop her car, watching her. His perpetually
          morose expression transforms into a smile.
          
          The SINK BASIN suddenly cracks from pressure. As Corey stares
          into the drain... WE PLUNGE DOWN INTO THE PIPE --
          
          
          POV OF TELEKINETIC ENERGY - INSIDE THE PIPE
          
          We travel through meters and meters of DANK PIPING until we
          hit the WATER MAIN. There's a sound like a TIDAL WAVE
          CRASHING --
          
          
          EXT. STREET/DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - LATER - DAWN
          
          -- WATER POURS out from under the garage door down to the
          street. PULL BACK TO REVEAL --
          
                                                                   55.
          
          
          The entire driveway and the street in front of the house are
          covered with water. FIRE TRUCKS, POLICE CARS and an AMBULANCE
          are gathered in front of the property.
          
          
          ANGLE: DOWN THE STREET
          
          Ruth runs toward her house. When she turns a corner and it
          comes into view, she stops dead in her tracks. Her face shows
          sheer terror --
          
          Because her father Dusty is handcuffed and being loaded into
          the back of a cruiser by Officer O'Dell and another
          policeman, OFFICER HINES...
          
          ...the PIT BULL struggles against it's CHAIN, growling and
          barking frantically.
          
          ...and Billy Moorcroft, half-naked, soaking wet and
          shivering, is wrapped in a blanket and being tended to by
          PARAMEDICS.
          
                              FIREMAN #2
                    Lucky I heard him screamin', else
                    he woulda drowned down there.
          
          Ruth keeps to the shadows and slinks toward a BACK DOOR...
          
          
          INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, FOOT OF THE STAIRS - DAWN
          
          She sloshes through four inches of water and skips up the
          stairs...
          
          
          INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, RUTH'S BEDROOM - DAWN
          
          Without turning on the lights, Ruth desperately rifles
          through her closet until she finds a SHOEBOX.
          
          Inside it are several PLASTIC BAGS -- some filled with
          MARIJUANA, others with COCAINE...
          
          
          INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - DAWN
          
          Hands shaking, Ruth dumps a bag of coke into the toilet and
          flushes it. The WHITE POWDER disappears down the swirling
          SPIRAL OF CLOUDY LIQUID...
          
          But the bowl doesn't refill.
          
                              RUTH
                    Shit!
          
                                                                    56.
          
          
          She begins to stuff the other bags down her pants...
          
          
          EXT. DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - DAWN
          
          Having deposited Dusty in the back of the cruiser and shut
          the door, O'Dell's attention turns to an upstairs window of
          the house when he sees MOVEMENT.
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - MORNING
          
          Randy rolls over in bed, opening his eyes to the new day. He
          looks around for Corey, disappointed to find her gone.
          
          
          INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
          
          Corey walks down an aisle of the department store. She finds
          Chris assisting a CUSTOMER.
          
                              CUSTOMER
                    I just checked aisle three.
          
                              CHRIS
                    They're there. At the front, by the
                    Trapper Keepers.
          
          The Customer moves off and Chris turns to find Corey standing
          beside him.
          
                              COREY
                    I'm outta cigarettes.
          
          
          EXT. BEHIND THE DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
          
          Corey waits behind the store until Chris comes out. She
          eagerly accepts TWO PACKS.
          
                              CHRIS
                    D'ya hear the news?
          
                              COREY
                    What?
          
                              CHRIS
                    They found that Billy Moorcroft
                    kid. He was at Dusty's house...
          
          Corey is floored.
          
                                                                   57.
          
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    Sick bastard had him locked up in
                    the basement. I can't believe we
                    were just over there yesterday.
          
          Corey can't help it... A grin spreads across her face.
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    I guess he's gonna be okay-
          
                              COREY
                    Everything's gonna be okay.
          
          Corey cuts him off, and Chris looks at her strangely.
          
                              COREY (CONT'D)
                    I'm not crazy. I think everything's
                    gonna be okay.
          
          
          INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - NIGHT
          
          Corey lays on her stomach in bed, studying The Philosophy of
          Time Travel. The book is open to: CHAPTER SIX - THE LIVING
          RECEIVER... The Living Receiver is chosen to guide the
          Artifact into position for its journey back to the Primary
          Universe. No one knows how or why a Receiver will be
          chosen...
          
          She flips through the onion skin pages to: CHAPTER TEN - THE
          MANIPULATED DEAD... The Manipulated Dead are more powerful
          than the Living Receiver. If a person dies within the Tangent
          Dimension, they are able to contact the Living Receiver
          through the Fourth Dimensional Construct...
          
          Corey glances over at the CLOSET MIRROR and sees Billy's
          image reflected. She flips over and finds him standing at the
          foot of the bed, clad in the same garb as all her visions.
          
                              COREY
                    I already saved you.
          
                              BILLY MOORCROFT
                    It's not over.
          
          He points to the CLOSET MIRROR... She stares into her own
          reflection as BILLY'S DISAPPEARS.
          
          HER IMAGE starts to FADE as well, and then the SURFACE OF THE
          MIRROR TRANSFORMS into a three-dimensional vision of a PARK.
          The focus is a SWING SET... and one of the SWINGS in
          particular, which rocks slowly back and forth. Empty. Void of
          life.
          
                                                                     58.
          
          
                                 COREY
                           (CONFUSED)
                    Why?
          
          
          INT. BILLY MOORCROFT'S HOUSE, DINING ROOM/DEN - DAY
          
          Inside Billy Moorcroft's quaint, sanitary-looking home is a
          small gathering to celebrate his return. STREAMERS hang over
          a table supporting a partially eaten CAKE. A BANNER that
          reads `WELCOME HOME BILLY!' is draped across the archway
          connecting the DINING ROOM to the DEN.
          
          BILLY'S MOTHER (32), with her fair complexion and dark hair,
          is an older female version of Billy himself.
          
          As she brings a POT OF COFFEE and a STACK OF CUPS into
          BILLY'S FATHER (35), BILLY'S AUNT and UNCLE, and a CHILD
          PSYCHOLOGIST who is moderating (50s; male) in the den, she
          looks as though she's barely keeping it together.
          
                              CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST
                        (between bites of cake)
                    The place for Billy to be right now
                    is at home with his family...
          
          Billy's Mother interrupts as she sets the coffee down.
          
                                 BILLY'S MOTHER
                    Excuse me.
          
                              CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST
                    Oh, thank you.
          
          The Psychologist accepts a cup.
          
                              CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST (CONT'D)
                    It'll take years for him to work
                    through what happened, but the best
                    way to open those doors is to
                    surround him with things that are
                    familiar...
          
          Billy's Mother passes her husband a cup, and they hold a
          long, painful moment of eye contact.
          
          
          INT. BILLY MOORCROFT'S HOUSE, BREAKFAST NOOK - MOMENTS LATER -
          DAY
          
          Billy sits at a table in the sunny, HEXAGONAL ROOM. He wears
          the BIRTHDAY HAT, SLACKS and COLLARED SHIRT.
          
                                                                     59.
          
          
          He appears clean and groomed, but his face and neck are
          marred by BRUISES and other ABRASIONS. Before him is a packet
          of COLORED PENCILS and some sheets of PAPER.
          
          His Mother walks up behind him, and peeks over his shoulder
          at the DRAWING that he's working on.
          
                               BILLY'S MOTHER
                    Are you sure you don't want some
                    more cake?
          
          Billy nods. His mother caresses his head as she watches him
          color. After a moment she sits down in a chair beside him and
          tries to get his attention.
          
                              BILLY'S MOTHER (CONT'D)
                    Billy... I-
          
          Before she can go on, she's interrupted by the DOORBELL.
          Billy never looks up.
          
          
          I/E. BILLY MOORCROFT'S HOUSE, FRONT DOOR - DAY
          
          Billy's Father answers the door and finds Corey.
          
                              BILLY'S FATHER
                    Only family and close friends are
                    welcome here today.
          
          Billy's Mother hovers behind her husband, curious about and
          wary of the stranger.
          
                              COREY
                    I understand... I just wanted to
                    say that I'm sorry about everything
                    that happened to Billy. And I know
                    it doesn't seem like it, but
                    everything happens for a reason...
                    and it'll all work out in the end.
          
          Billy's Father stares her down until she turns to leave
          uncomfortably. Billy's Mother starts to cry... CUT BACK TO:
          
          
          INT. BILLY MOORCROFT'S HOUSE, BREAKFAST NOOK - DAY
          
          ...the breakfast nook. Billy is gone.
          
          Left on the table is his completed DRAWING. It's a neatly
          executed rendition of a SWING SET -- identical to the one
          from Corey's vision in the closet door mirror.
          
                                                                     60.
          
          
          EXT. PARK - DAY
          
          Billy walks through the empty park, still wearing his
          birthday hat. He makes his way past a SAND PIT with a JUNGLE
          GYM.
          
          Balanced on one of the jungle gym's bars is a PRESCRIPTION
          BOTTLE...
          
          Billy picks it up. The name on the prescription is COREY
          RICHARDSON. JUMP CUT TO:
          
          The SWING SET. Billy leans back as far as he can as momentum
          propels his body forward and back through space. He looks up
          to the sky where SUPERNATURAL BLACK CLOUDS are forming...
          
          He swings back and forth... back and forth...
          
          
          ANGLE: PARK BENCH
          
          Corey sits nearby on a park bench, watching Billy. He looks
          back at her, showing no signs of recognition... JUMP CUT TO:
          
          The SWING. No longer a little boy sitting in it. It dangles
          erratically from the ropes, still gripped by inertia...
          
          PAN DOWN to the sandy ground below -- FIND the bottle of
          pills, now empty. Billy's unmoving, OPEN HAND...
          
          
          EXT. OKLAHOMA HIGHWAY 40/EL RENO EXIT - AFTERNOON
          
          A TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK gets off the highway and heads into
          El Reno. It's load is a batch of beat up, OLD CARS.
          
          The JALOPY is on the TOP RACK, CLOSEST TO THE END...
          
          
          EXT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - AFTERNOON
          
          Randy peeks in the window of Corey's motel room but sees
          nothing. He pounds on the door and calls for her:
          
                               RANDY
                    Corey...
          
          
          EXT. INTERSECTION NEAR DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON
          
          Corey arrives near the intersection where the accident took
          place. The BLACK CLOUDS overhead have become more vast and
          oppressive. A cold WIND blows...
          
                                                                     61.
          
          
          The TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK breaches the crest of a hill and
          comes into view, descending on the intersection.
          
          Above it the CLOUDS begin to transform and take the shape of
          an ASTRONOMICAL WORMHOLE that reaches down toward the
          earth...
          
          
          EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON
          
          Chris comes outside and gazes up at the foreboding sky...
          
          
          EXT. INTERSECTION NEAR DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON
          
          As the TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK approaches the intersection,
          Corey fixates on the JALOPY on the back...
          
          
          CLOSE ANGLE: JALOPY
          
          The CHAINS that hold the junker in place SHAKE and RATTLE...
          
          
          EXT. THE ETHER - AFTERNOON - POV INSIDE PORTAL
          
          We plunge through the PORTAL as it twists through the
          ether...
          
          
          EXT. INTERSECTION NEAR DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON
          
          The WORMHOLE extends down to the JALOPY. Gracefully. Like an
          eel moving through water, confidently pursuing it's prey...
          mouth widening to swallow...
          
          Corey is riveted.
          
          As it passes through the intersection, the TRACTOR-TRAILER
          hits a POTHOLE -- CUT TO:

          AFTERNOON
          
          Sam is walking in front of the department store when Randy's
          car pulls up beside her. Corey sticks her head out the
          passenger side window.
          
                              COREY
                    What happened to you?
          
                              SAM
                    What happened to me...? Where the

                              COREY
                    I crashed at Randy's. We just got
                    food. Want a burger?
          
                              SAM
                    My stomach's fucked up.
          
                      JEFF                               MIKE
          Awww...                           Poor tummy...
          
          Jeff and Mike taunt her from the back. Ruth leers.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    We gotta talk about what we're
                    gonna do.
          
                              COREY
                    Don't worry about it so much.
          
                              SAM
                    The motel guy came to the room this
                    MORNING-
          
                              COREY
                        (INTERRUPTING)
                    I don't give a fuck.
          
                                 SAM
                    Excuse me?
          
                                                                     63.
          
          
                              COREY
                    I said, I. Don't. Give. A. Fuck...
          
          She annunciates every word like a true bitch.
          
                              COREY (CONT'D)
                    I'm tired of listening to you whine
                    about everything.
          
          Giggles from the peanut gallery in the car.
          
                              SAM
                    Corey, you're still drunk. Don't be
                    a fuck-ass.
          
                              JEFF
                    Did she just call her a fuck-ass?
          
                              MIKE
                    What's a fuck-ass?
          
          Everyone cracks up, including Corey. Sam is humiliated. She
          backs away from the car, anger burning in her eyes. Randy
          revs the engine, expressing his will to take off.
          
                              COREY
                    See ya later, Sam.
          
          Sam says nothing, but watches as Randy's car peels off toward
          the intersection. She's confused and hurt, frozen to the spot
          where she's standing.
          
          As Corey stares back at Sam from the car, her smile fades...
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S CAR - CONTINUOUS
          
          Corey turns to face the approaching intersection. Resolute.
          
          
          INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON
          
          Chris is at work, stocking shelves inside the department
          store...
          
          He checks his watch, stops what he's doing and grabs a PACK
          OF CIGARETTES from his breast pocket -- time for a smoke
          break.
          
                                                                  64.
          
          
          EXT. INTERSECTION NEAR DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON
          
          Randy's car is stopped at the red light. Sam strolls toward
          it ever so slowly. Jeff, Mike and Ruth gawk at her from the
          backseat.
          
          She slows down even more, having no interest in subjecting
          herself to any more of their mockery...
          
          The light turns green, and Randy's car peels across the
          intersection, making a left. Sam's still 10 or 15 feet away
          from stepping into the street...
          
          She quickens her pace, almost there when --
          
          KA-BOOM!
          
          FROM OUT OF NOWHERE AN OLD JALOPY SAILS RIGHT IN FRONT
          RANDY'S CAR! He jerks the wheel -- and the jalopy hits on the
          front passenger side -- completely smashing it in --
          
          Sam spins when she HEARS the deafening CRUNCH...
          
          Randy careens into the opposite lane, and an ONCOMING CAR
          smacks him dead on. The inertia from the oncoming vehicle
          plows his car into a FIRE HYDRANT by the side of the road.
          
          The hydrant goes flying through the air like a bullet and
          skitters harmlessly across the intersection --
          
          The world goes SILENT.
          
          CHRIS RUNS TOWARD THE DESTRUCTION, DROPPING HIS CIGARETTE...
          
          WATER ERUPTS LIKE A GEYSER FROM THE PIPE WHERE THE HYDRANT
          USED TO BE...
          
          THE JALOPY IS FLIPPED OVER ONTO ITS SIDE...
          
          SAM STANDS PEERING AT THE WRECKAGE... THE AREA OF THE CAR
          WHERE COREY WAS SITTING IS VIRTUALLY NONEXISTENT. SHE DROPS
          TO HER KNEES.
          
          
          INT. POLICE STATION - AFTERNOON
          
          Sam signs her STATEMENT on Officer O'Dell's desk, her eyes
          red and puffy from crying. O'Dell sits facing her.
          
                               OFFICER O'DELL
                     I just gotta ask you one more
                     time... you're sure you didn't see
                     a driver?
          
                                                                    65.
          
          
          Sam shakes her head no, and he takes the statement from her.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                    Well, we'll find him, one way or
                    another.
          
          Sam nods in acknowledgement. O'Dell sees how much this has
          traumatized her.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                    Why don't you stop in and see Dr.
                    Peters on your way out... right
                    down the hall there. She'll give
                    you somethin' to make you feel
                    better.
          
          
          EXT. POLICE STATION, BACK PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON
          
          Sam walks out of the police station and finds herself in the
          secluded back parking lot. She holds a PRESCRIPTION for anti-
          depressants...
          
          A pair of eyes peek out of the bushes close by -- it's
          Vietnam Tom. He's wearing his ski mask and he's got his
          rifle. He sees Sam, but she doesn't see him.
          
          Sam wells up with emotion, about to breakdown, and Tom
          watches her with empathy. It looks as though he's about to go
          to her when something stops him -- Chris comes out the door.
          
                                CHRIS
                    You okay?
          
          Sam is still too choked up to speak. Tom sneaks away
          unnoticed...
          
          
          INT. CHRIS' TRUCK - AFTERNOON
          
          Sam sits in the passenger side of Chris' truck and cries and
          cries. Major emotional release.
          
          Chris looks like he wants to say something, but doesn't have
          the words.
          
          
          I/E. CHRIS' TRUCK/MOTEL - EVENING
          
          Chris and Sam pull up to the motel in his pick-up. They've
          gone to get her prescription filled, and Sam has the BOTTLE
          OF PILLS in her hand.
          
                                                                  66.
          
          
                              CHRIS
                    I'm really sorry, Sam.
          
          She doesn't respond.
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    It's horrible... but sometimes
                    these things can happen for a
                    reason. Sometimes good can come of
                    it... growth, ya know?
          
                              SAM
                    What the fuck are you talking
                    about?
          
          Sam's benumbed expression doesn't change, but her tone is
          caustic.
          
                              CHRIS
                    All I meant was, sometimes-
          
                              SAM
                    I know what you meant, and it's
                    bullshit. When someone dies for no
                    reason you can't just make one up
                    to fill the void and make yourself
                    feel better. It sucks, and it fucks
                    everything up, but it doesn't mean
                    shit beyond that.
          
                              CHRIS
                    I'm sorry, I-
          
                              SAM
                    You've obviously never lost anybody
                    like I have, `cause if you did
                    you'd already know that.
          
          Chris doesn't try anymore. Sam immediately feels bad.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    Thanks for the ride.
          
          She gets out of the car and slogs toward her room.
          
          
          INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - EVENING
          
          Sam swallows her PILLS with some water, and sits down on one
          of the full-size beds by her BACKPACK...
          
          She reaches inside and pulls out THE PHILOSOPHY OF TIME
          TRAVEL book, by Roberta Sparrow. As she studies the cover,
          her image is reflected by the CLOSET DOOR MIRRORS.
          
                                                                  67.
          
          
          The angle of the mirrors creates double image reflections for
          other objects in the room... and Sam's reflection is present
          in both of the panes.
          
          The digital CLOCK/RADIO shows 6:30 PM...
          
          She looks at the PICTURES OF HER FAMILY tucked away inside
          the book: Sam with her mother and father; Sam as a child with
          her sister and brother; an old photo of the whole Darko
          family together...
          
          Tears come to her eyes as she focuses on an image of Donnie,
          and she puts them all down. She touches the SCAR on the inner
          part of her right wrist...
          
          She then glances down and notices that the book is open to:
          CHAPTER NINE - REMNANTS.
          
                              SAM
                    Remnants...
          
          A portion of the text includes: Like Dreams that the
          Manipulated can have after journeys into Tangent or
          Fragmentary Universes, sounds and images may be transferred
          from one Tangent or Fragmentary Universe to another, as all
          corruptions exist on relative cosmic planes...
          
          
          EXT. JUNKYARD - NIGHT
          
          Sam wanders through the junkyard clad in her HOODED
          SWEATSHIRT and JEANS, with the MAKESHIFT BANDAGE wrapped
          around her right hand. The SHARD OF METAL protrudes from the
          GASH by her temple.
          
          
          SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - THE JUNKYARD
          
          She sees the junkyard as the phosphorescent DESTINY PLANE.
          DEAD CARS, MACHINERY and piles of SCRAP METAL glow as
          stationary objects within the complex grid. A PAIR OF RATS
          follow their VECTOR SPEARS as they shimmy up the side of a
          RUSTY TRACTOR...
          
          Sam treads effortlessly through the darkness, past the heaps
          of junk toward the decrepit STORAGE SHACK marked by the
          CORRUGATED ROOFING...
          
          
          ANGLE: STORAGE SHACK
          
          She stands before the shack, having discovered Vietnam Tom.
          He squats in the darkened corner of the scrappy shelter, and
          looks back at her through the eyeholes of a new mask --
          
                                                                    68.
          
          
          He wears on his face the SCULPTURE made of SCRAP METAL, which
          has been formed into the COUNTENANCE OF THE MONSTER BUNNY.
          
                              SAM
                    Hi, Tom. I like your new mask.
          
          Tom trembles like the frightened animal he personifies as Sam
          runs her fingers down one of the LONG, METALLIC EARS, down to
          one of the SHARPENED INCISORS of the EVIL-LOOKING GRIN...
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    Are you scared?
          
          As this contact is made the tarnished metal becomes
          transparent, and the NEURONS in TOM'S BRAIN can be seen
          sending ELECTRIC IMPULSES, in turn RELEASING
          NEUROTRANSMITTERS and exciting OTHER NEURONS...
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    I know you can hear me...
          
          A PORTAL forms around the shelter like a giant cylinder,
          enclosing them. Tom rises, afraid... Sam takes his hand...
          
          The PORTAL shrinks and squeezes the walls until they bend
          inward, then begin to CREAK and RUMBLE --
          
          
          EXT. BENEATH OVERPASS - THE NEXT MORNING
          
          Sam awakens to a fierce RUMBLING overhead.
          
          It happens again, and when she looks around she realizes that
          she's underneath a highway overpass in BOXER SHORTS and a T-
          SHIRT, barefoot, lying on a FLAT AREA atop the CEMENT SLOPE
          that leads down to the road below.
          
          Alarmed by both the height and sanitation of her current
          position, she shifts her body and starts to slide down the
          SLOPE...
          
          Once on even ground, she notices a brand new `95 BMW coming
          toward her.
          
                                 SAM
                    Perfect...
          
          Jeremy pulls up next to her and rolls down his window.
          
                              JEREMY
                    Sam? Are you okay? What are doing?
          
                              SAM
                    I'm... yeah, I'm okay.
          
                                                                    69.
          
          
          Jeremy gets out of the car and puts his hand on her shoulder.
          
                              JEREMY
                    You shouldn't be out here like
                    this. C'mon, get in.
          
          She allows herself to be led to the passenger side...
          
          
          INT. JEREMY'S BMW - MORNING
          
          Sam leans her head back against the headrest as Jeremy
          drives.
          
                              JEREMY
                    You do that a lot?
          
                              SAM
                    I think it's genetic or something.
          
                              JEREMY
                    That's interesting... I've never
                    heard of a specific genetic marker
                    for sleepwalking.
          
                               SAM
                    It's just that my brother used to
                    do it too.
          
                              JEREMY
                    He doesn't anymore?
          
                              SAM
                    No.
          
                              JEREMY
                    I think it's more common in
                    children. When did your brother
                    stop?
          
                              SAM
                    When he died.
          
          
          EXT. FIELD BEHIND MOTEL - MORNING
          
          Some WORKERS are in the process of   rebuilding the WINDMILL. A
          MAN WITH A HOSE sprays the side of   the WATER TANK in an
          attempt to wash off the burn marks   resembling the nearly
          imperceptible image of the MONSTER   BUNNY'S FACE...
          
                                                                   70.
          
          
          I/E. JEREMY'S BMW/MOTEL - MORNING
          
          Jeremy pulls into the motel parking lot. Sam hesitates for a
          moment before getting out.
          
                              JEREMY
                    I heard about your friend...
          
          Sam doesn't say anything, so he goes on.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    I wasn't gonna say anything... but
                    then I thought I probably should,
                    because if I didn't, it might be
                    inconsiderate.
          
                              SAM
                    Well... okay. Thanks.
          
          A beat.
          
                              JEREMY
                    So... what are you gonna do?
          
                              SAM
                    I don't know yet.
          
          Sam brushes her mussed hair out of her face, still not
          wanting to go inside the motel room.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    Do you believe that everything
                    happens for a reason?
          
                              JEREMY
                    I know that for every action
                    there's an equal and opposite
                    reaction.
          
                              SAM
                    Yeah... I learned that in science.
          
                              JEREMY
                    And everything in the universe is
                    in constant motion, as the universe
                    is constantly expanding...
          
                              SAM
                    Yeah, but do you believe that
                    everything happens for a reason,
                    like in life?
          
                              JEREMY
                    You mean like destiny?
          
                                                                  71.
          
          
          Jeremy thinks on this for a moment.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    I think everyone has a purpose.
                    Something they're meant to do. Like
                    potential, but more clear-cut. For
                    instance, I was destined to get my
                    hands on the meteorite.
          
                                 SAM
                    Really.
          
                               JEREMY
                    I'm making amazing discoveries
                    every day, practically sleeping at
                    the lab...
          
          While he talks and becomes more excited he scratches
          nervously at his left forearm. It draws Sam's attention away
          from what he's saying.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    I'm still doing some tests, but
                    there's a metallic substance that's
                    not showing up on the elemental
                    CHARTS-
          
                              SAM
                    What happened to your arm?
          
          Jeremy stops scratching. A small area on the inner part of
          his wrist is RAW and RED, partially SCABBED OVER.
          
                              JEREMY
                    It's just a rash.
          
          Sam starts to get out of the car.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    Sam, wait. Here...
          
          He offers her a wad of cash. Sam hesitates.
          
                                 SAM
                    BUT-
          
                              JEREMY
                    I know you need it. It's no big
                    deal.
          
          She accepts the money.
          
                                 SAM
                    Thank you.
          
                                                                    72.
          
          
          INT. LAUNDROMAT - DAY
          
          Sam shoves a load of her wet clothes into an industrial
          DRYER. She plugs in some quarters, presses the button, and
          sits back in a chair in front of the machine.
          
          As she stares into the whirling cylinder, her eyes defocus
          and she goes into a daze... TRANSITION TO:
          
          
          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT - CLOSE UP - TOY UNICORN
          
          ARIEL, the STUFFED TOY UNICORN spins on a ROTATING CHAIR...
          
                              YOUNG SAMANTHA (V.O.)
                    Donnie!
          
                              DONNIE DARKO (V.O.)
                        (MOCKING)
                    The Last Unicorn, by Samantha
                    Darko!
          
                              YOUNG SAMANTHA (V.O.)
                    Give it back!
          
                              DONNIE DARKO (V.O.)
                    There was once a unicorn named
                    Ariel...
          
          The SOUND of CRINKLING PAPER.
          
                              YOUNG SAMANTHA (V.O.)
                    Donnie! You wrinkled it.
          
                              DONNIE DARKO (V.O.)
                    It's not wrinkled Sam. Just, ya
                    know, flatten it in a book or
                    something...
          
          The chair is re-spun by an O.S. hand... and the UNICORN
          topples off onto the floor. BACK TO:
          
          
          INT. LAUNDROMAT - DAY
          
          Sam snaps out of her vision when she hears Trudy and Father
          Homeijer going around, asking for change.
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                    Any small amount you could manage
                    would really help.
          
          They hover over a FAT MAN, holding out the COLLECTIONS JAR.
          
                                                                     73.
          
          
                              FAT MAN
                    Piss off...
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                    God bless you.
          
          As they move down the line and approach Sam, she tenses up.
          Trudy is about to go into her spiel when she recognizes her.
          
                              TRUDY
                    Oh... hello.
          
          She smiles at Sam politely, trying not to be too awkward. It
          doesn't work.
          
          Aware of Sam's financial situation, she gives Father Homeijer
          the hint to move on. He follows her lead.
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                        (to Sam)
                    God bless you.
          
          Sam watches as they move on to the next person, suddenly
          filled with sadness...
          
          
          EXT. PAYPHONE OUTSIDE BUILDING - AFTERNOON
          
          Sam stands outside at a payphone, listening to it RING...
          Someone on the other end finally picks up:
          
                                ROSE DARKO (V.O.)
                    Hello?
          
          When Sam HEARS her MOTHER'S VOICE, it brings tears to her
          eyes. As if feeling her emotion over the phone line, Rose can
          be HEARD starting to WHIMPER.
          
                                ROSE DARKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Samantha?
          
                              EDDIE DARKO (V.O.)
                        (in the background)
                    Who is it, Rose?
          
                               ROSE DARKO (V.O.)
                        (CRYING)
                    Is that you?... if it's you, please
                    come home.
          
                                EDDIE DARKO (V.O.)
                    Rose?
          
          Although it looks like she wants to, Sam doesn't speak.
          
                                                                  74.
          
          
          EXT. LOOKOUT, VIETNAM TOM'S SQUATTING GROUND - NIGHT
          
          Vietnam Tom sits at his new squatting ground, looking out
          over all of El Reno. He peers at the twinkling lights through
          his scrap metal BUNNY MASK, and cradles his RIFLE in his arms
          like a soldier at rest.
          
          He slowly turns and sees that Sam is sitting right next to
          him, facing the landscape. She wears her HOODED SWEATSHIRT,
          JEANS and the BANDAGE. The SHARD OF METAL is lodged in her
          forehead.
          
                              SAM
                    You wanna know what happens when
                    you die?
          
          Tom shakes his head no.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    I wish it was me.
          
          She looks at Tom.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    I really want... to die.
          
          Tom aims his gun at her face...
          
          He realizes that a FORCE FIELD has formed in between them,
          because when the barrel of the gun touches it, the barrier
          bends and becomes slightly opaque.
          
          Sam is expressionless. Tom's finger trembles as he places it
          on the trigger.
          
          He aims down the gun's sights, directly at Sam's RIGHT EYE,
          and sees a PHOSPHORESCENT GRID take shape like a coordinate
          system on the force field. Sam's eye is in the CENTRAL
          QUADRANT...
          
          Tom pulls the trigger. TIME SLOWS DOWN.
          
          A liquid VECTOR SPEAR shoots out of the gun barrel.
          Immediately after, a BULLET is discharged and follows it...
          
          The VECTOR SPEAR passes cleanly through the grid, but when
          the BULLET reaches it, the entire force field curves to
          accommodate the penetrating force...
          
          The spear juts out until it nearly touches Sam's eye... but
          then it stops. The bullet catches up and freezes at the same
          spot, centimeters from her face --
          
                                                                  75.
          
          
                               SAM (CONT'D)
                        (DISAPPOINTED)
                    Not today.
          
          
          I/E. MOTEL ROOM 15 - DAY
          
          A HAND bangs on the door to room 15...
          
          After a beat, Sam opens it. She's got some makeup on, and has
          spent more time on her hair than usual.
          
                                SAM
                          (SURPRISED)
                    Hi.
          
          Chris lingers in front of the door, looking slightly
          uncomfortable.
          
                              CHRIS
                    I just stopped by to see how you
                    were holdin' up.
          
                                SAM
                    I'm okay.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Sorry about the other night... I
                    DIDN'T-
          
                              SAM
                    I was just upset. I shouldn't have
                    snapped at you like that.
          
          Chris nods, grateful for her forgiveness.
          
                              CHRIS
                    So what are you still doin' here? I
                    figured you woulda hopped on a bus
                    by now.
          
                              SAM
                    I'm gonna be taking off soon, I
                    think. I just gotta figure some
                    stuff out. It's quiet here.
          
                              CHRIS
                    I don't know if you're doin'
                    anything later on, but...
          
          He trails off when he HEARS a CAR pull up and park by his
          truck. He turns and sees that it's Jeremy in his BMW.
          
                                                                  76.
          
          
                              SAM
                    I was just on my way out. What were
                    you gonna say?
          
                                 CHRIS
                    Nothin'.
          
                              SAM
                    Okay, well... I'll see you later?
          
                              CHRIS
                    Yeah, sure.
          
          He steps out of the way so Sam can shut and lock the door.
          
                                 SAM
                    Bye.
          
                                 CHRIS
                    Bye.
          
          Chris stares down Jeremy as Sam gets into his car and they
          drive off together.
          
          
          INT. LAB - DAY
          
          Jeremy turns on the overhead florescent lights in the lab.
          There are ROWS OF DESKS with MICROSCOPES and some PRECISION
          ROCK SLICING EQUIPMENT.
          
          As he walks to a desk near the back, he can barely contain
          his excitement. Sam follows, taking note of a LARGE RABBIT in
          an extremely SMALL CAGE...
          
                              JEREMY
                    Here's my station.
          
          He unlocks a drawer in the lower portion of the desk and
          retrieves a BOX containing a tiny SLICE OF ROCK with a grid-
          like PATTERN OF METALLIC CRYSTALS embedded in it.
          
                                 SAM
                    That's it?
          
                              JEREMY
                    The rest is locked away somewhere
                    else... somewhere safe. Everyone's
                    gonna want a piece of this thing
                    pretty soon.
          
          He takes it over to an SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPE and turns
          it on. He places the meteorite slice in the microscope's
          VACUUM COLUMN through an AIRTIGHT DOOR.
          
                                                                  77.
          
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    You ever seen one of these?
          
                               SAM
                    No.
          
                              JEREMY
                    It's a scanning electron
                    microscope. It uses electrons
                    instead of light to scan the image.
          
          A BLACK & WHITE IMAGE appears on the microscope's MONITOR --
          it's a geometric collage of all shapes and shades.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    At first I thought it was a
                    siderite, but then I saw it was
                    more than that. Much more. It does
                    have a percentage of nickel and
                    iron in it as I first suspected.
                    But it also has something else.
          
          He waits for Sam to take the bait.
          
                              SAM
                    And what's that?
          
          He points to cluster of BRIGHT WHITES on the monitor. Their
          shapes are strangely different than the others surrounding
          them.
          
                              JEREMY
                    An unrecognizable element. I've
                    done all the tests. It doesn't
                    exist on the periodic table.
          
          Jeremy is practically beaming.
          
                              SAM
                    So this is pretty major.
          
                              JEREMY
                    This is history. I'm thinking of
                    calling it framium.
          
                               SAM
                    Framium?
          
                              JEREMY
                    For my last name... Frame.
          
                                                                    78.
          
          
                              SAM
                    What if it's like... proof of some
                    alien life-form from another galaxy
                    or something.
          
          Jeremy's tone becomes serious, and he starts to scratch at
          his left forearm as he talks.
          
                              JEREMY
                    It's very important you promise me
                    you won't tell anyone else what
                    I've showed you. I have to wait
                    till just the right moment. NASA,
                    or some secret government
                    organization could come in here and
                    take it away from me...
          
          As Jeremy gets more worked up, he scratches harder...
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    And then later on, years from now,
                    take credit for the discovery
                    themselves.
          
                              SAM
                    I won't say anything.
          
                              JEREMY
                    Good.
          
          Sam stares at him for a long beat, as if examining him.
          
                              SAM
                    There's this book I think you'd
                    like... I got it from my physics
                    teacher in high school.
          
                              JEREMY
                    The study of physics has unraveled
                    some of the most profound mysteries
                    of the universe.
          
                              SAM
                    It's called The Philosophy of Time
                    Travel.
          
                              JEREMY
                    Time travel?
          
                              SAM
                    Yeah, but it's not really that.
                    It's more like one scenario, or one
                    type of scenario. I don't
                    completely understand it...
          
                                                                     79.
          
          
          Sam gazes at the cluster of white shapes on the monitor.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    Another mystery.
          
                              JEREMY
                    What do you mean?
          
                              SAM
                    My life seems to be full of them.
          
                              JEREMY
                    Mysteries are what make life
                    interesting...
          
          Sam doesn't agree or disagree. She's become tense, because
          Jeremy's face is now in close proximity to hers.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    You're a mystery to me, Samantha.
          
          He goes in for a kiss, but Sam gently pushes him away.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    Ow...
          
          Jeremy retreats, shielding his left arm. Sam looks down and
          sees that the red, raw area has turned into a much bigger
          RASH, covering a large part of his wrist and extending onto
          his forearm.
          
                              SAM
                    That doesn't look good.
          
                              JEREMY
                    I should get some Hydrocortisone.
          
          He looks pathetic, and Sam feels sorry for him.
          
                               SAM
                        (regarding the attempted
                         KISS)
                    Sorry about that.
          
                              JEREMY
                    I'm sorry. I should've know better.
                    You barely know me, right?
          
                              SAM
                    And nobody really calls my
                    Samantha. Just my mom and dad.
          
          Jeremy manages a smile, and Sam smiles back.
          
                                                                     80.
          
          
          INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON
          
          Chris is at work, stocking shelves inside the department
          store...
          
          He checks his watch, stops what he's doing and grabs a PACK
          OF CIGARETTES from his breast pocket -- time for a smoke
          break.
          
          
          EXT. INTERSECTION NEAR DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON
          
          The TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK carrying the JALOPY breaches the
          crest of the hill, descending on the intersection...
          
          
          EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Chris lights up a cigarette...
          
          
          CHRIS' POV - TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK
          
          He watches as the TRACTOR-TRAILER hits the pothole, but
          passes safely through the intersection, making a right.
          
          Something about the sight of this strikes Chris so much that
          his cigarette falls out of his mouth.
          
          
          EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
          
          Father Homeijer and Trudy stroll down a quiet street with
          their COLLECTIONS JAR, and arrive at a fork in the road.
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                    You take this street, I'll take
                    that one?
          
          Without warning, Trudy kisses him on the cheek.
          
                                 TRUDY
                    Good luck.
          
          Father Homeijer blushes, but Trudy smiles at him in a
          friendly manner. They move off in separate directions...
          
          
          EXT. DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - DAY
          
          Father Homeijer raps on the door of Dusty's house. No answer.
          
                                                                  81.
          
          
          INT. DUSTY'S GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
          
          The priest lets himself into the garage, which is open but
          deserted. He notices COREY'S CHEVROLET. He steps up to the
          GARAGE ENTRANCE and knocks...
          
          No one comes to the door, but he notices that it's slightly
          ajar.
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                    Dusty?
          
          He can hear COUNTRY MUSIC playing low within.
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER (CONT'D)
                    Are you home, son?
          
          He lets himself inside...
          
          
          INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY
          
          Father Homeijer walks into the dingy kitchen. The SINK is
          full of DIRTY DISHES. A coating of GRIME over everything.
          
          
          INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, LIVING - CONTINUOUS - ANGLE ON - PIT BULL
          
          The sleeping PIT BULL stirs...
          
          
          INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
          
          The priest sees that the COUNTRY SONG is coming from a STEREO
          that sits on the kitchen counter.
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                        (calling out)
                    Dusty? I'd like to trouble you for
                    a small donation...
          
          The COUNTRY SONG comes to a close, and the tape runs out.
          With the music gone, the priest cocks his head to a new sound
          -- soft, distant CRYING.
          
          He looks curiously toward the CELLAR DOOR... [Note: The
          CRYING SOUND should be identical to the one that drew Corey
          out of the motel room.]
          
                                                                     82.
          
          
          INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, BASEMENT - DAY
          
          Father Homeijer slowly descends the rickety BASEMENT STEPS.
          At the bottom, he finds a STRING that connects to a bare
          overhead BULB...
          
          He creeps along the dusty cement floor, past an old
          WASHER/DRYER, continuing toward the source of the CRYING,
          which has become more pronounced. He wrinkles his nose at a
          foul smell...
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                    Who's there?
          
          He rounds a corner, and when he sees Billy Moorcroft he's
          nearly frozen in shock --
          
          The boy is locked inside a large, METAL DOG'S CAGE. He sits
          on the floor of the cage, rocking back and forth.
          
          He is pale, bruised and slick with sweat, clothed only in a
          pair of SOILED BRIEFS. Beside him is an aluminum WATER BOWL
          and some scraps of WHITE BREAD. The floor beneath him is
          soaked with URINE and scattered FECES.
          
          Father Homeijer makes the sign of the cross.
          
          
          EXT. DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - LATER - DAY
          
          Dusty's place is surrounded by FIRE TRUCKS, POLICE CARS and
          an AMBULANCE. Billy Moorcroft is wrapped in a blanket and
          being tended to by PARAMEDICS.
          
          Father Homeijer stands near the boy, being interviewed by a
          DETECTIVE.
          
          Dusty is handcuffed and being loaded into the back of a
          cruiser by Officer O'Dell and another policeman, OFFICER
          HINES (28).
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    Get in there, you sick fuck...
          
          Dusty says nothing as O'Dell shoves him in and slams the
          door...
          
          The two officers turn when they see RANDY'S DAD'S CAR pull up
          next to the property. Randy is in the driver's seat, looking
          confused. Ruth hops out of the passenger seat and darts
          toward the house --
          
          -- but she is cut off and grabbed by a POLICEMAN. ANOTHER
          OFFICER goes to talk to Randy in the car.
          
                                                                   83.
          
          
          Wheels turning, O'Dell addresses Hines:
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                        (regarding Dusty)
                    Let him rot in there for a few
                    minutes, maybe till the news guys
                    show up... I'm gonna go finish
                    checkin' upstairs.
          
          
          INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, RUTH'S BEDROOM - DAY
          
          O'Dell lets himself into Ruth's bedroom. It's a mess -- her
          CLOTHES are all over the floor, and crinkled ROCK POSTERS
          litter the walls.
          
          Next to her bed is a FRAMED PICTURE of she and Randy. O'Dell
          starts to rifle through her desk drawers, one after another --
          
          He tosses the closet, throwing out clothes and shoes... until
          he finds the SHOEBOX. He opens it up, satisfied...
          
          
          ANGLE: OUTSIDE THE BEDROOM DOOR
          
          Officer Hines stands by the door, looking in at O'Dell
          covertly.
          
          
          INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - MORNING
          
          Sam lies in bed in front of the television. A NEWS BULLETIN
          comes on about Billy's Moorcroft's rescue:
          
                              TELEVISION ANCHOR
                    We have an update this morning on
                    our breaking news of Billy
                    Moorcroft, the El Reno youth who
                    was kidnapped over 15 months ago,
                    and rescued yesterday afternoon by
                    Father Homeijer of Mount Calvary
                    Church. Billy's condition at this
                    time is considered stable...
          
          Sam stares at the television, dumbfounded. The news cuts to
          the scene of the rescue, where Father Homeijer is being
          INTERVIEWED:
          
                              FIELD REPORTER
                    Father, what led you to this
                    particular house on this particular
                    day?
          
                                                                  84.
          
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                    I was out collecting donations in
                    order to help rebuild my church,
                    Mount Calvary, which recently
                    burned down. Clearly the Lord works
                    in mysterious ways. This is nothing
                    less than divine intervention...
          
          
          EXT. MOTEL - MORNING
          
          As Sam's walking away from the motel, she looks up to the sky
          at a PASSING JET...
          
                              AGATHA (V.O.)
                    No matter how well you think you
                    know somebody, you just never
                    really know...
          
          
          INT. DINER - MORNING
          
          Sam sits at the booth where she and Corey sat before, and
          Agatha sets down a glass of ORANGE JUICE.
          
                              AGATHA
                    Dusty Gibbens has been comin' in
                    here for coffee ever since I can
                    remember... gives me the shivers.
          
          Ted pipes up from behind the counter:
          
                              TED
                    They should hang guys like that.
                    Only thing bothers me is how many
                    of `em are still out there...
          
          Chris enters the diner and catches the end of Ted's rant.
          
                              TED (CONT'D)
                    Hang `em all.
          
                               AGATHA
                        (to Sam)
                    I'll be right back with your
                    breakfast.
          
          As Agatha moves off, Chris sees Sam and approaches her table.
          
                                 CHRIS
                    May I?
          
                                 SAM
                    Sure.
          
                                                                  85.
          
          
                              CHRIS
                    I guess you heard.
          
                              SAM
                    Yeah.
          
                              CHRIS
                    It's so messed up... I feel bad
                    that I recommended him now.
          
          Agatha notices that Chris has sat down with Sam.
          
                              AGATHA
                    What can I get you, honey?
          
                              CHRIS
                    Uh... sausage, eggs, coffee,
                    please.
          
                              AGATHA
                    White or wheat?
          
                              CHRIS
                    Wheat toast, please...
          
          He refocuses his attention back on Sam.
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    If I had kids, I'd be worried sick
                    about `em in a world like this. I'm
                    sure your parents must be.
          
                              SAM
                    Hey, you could've been some crazy
                    rapist serial killer.
          
          Agatha is there with his coffee just in time to hear this
          last part. She gives Chris and Sam each an odd look before
          setting the coffee down and leaving.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    You turned out okay.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Yeah, but everybody doesn't.
          
                              SAM
                    I can take care of myself.
          
                              CHRIS
                    I'm sure you can... but I wouldn't
                    feel right if I didn't tell you
                    about Jeremy.
          
                                                          86.
          
          
                              SAM
                    What about him?
          
                              CHRIS
                    I don't know what you have goin'
                    with him... but you shouldn't be
                    hangin' around him. Let's just
                    leave it at that.
          
                              SAM
                    What makes you think you can tell
                    me who I can and can't hang around
                    with?
          
                              CHRIS
                    It's just that I know him better
                    than you do. He lived in my
                    neighborhood when we were kids.
          
                              SAM
                    So?
          
                              CHRIS
                    So he used to do weird stuff... to
                    animals.
          
          Sam waits for him to go on.
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    My sister lost her pet rabbit once,
                    and we went all over the
                    neighborhood lookin' for it. We
                    were just about to call it quits
                    when we heard something comin' from
                    Jeremy's garage. He'd stuck it in a
                    trash can and put the lid on.
          
          Sam looks shocked and a little disgusted.
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    It was half starved by the time we
                    got it home. Died just a few days
                    later.
          
                              SAM
                    How old was he?
          
                              CHRIS
                    I don't know, just a couple years.
                    Cute little black and white-
          
                              SAM
                    No. Jeremy.
          
                                                                  87.
          
          
                              CHRIS
                    He was like nine, probably.
          
                              SAM
                    He was just a kid, he didn't know
                    what he was doing.
          
                              CHRIS
                    When you were nine years old did
                    you know it was wrong to put a
                    living creature in the trash can
                    and leave it there?
          
          Sam's had enough.
          
                              SAM
                    Chris... you're a nice guy, but you
                    don't have to be looking out for
                    me. You're not my dad, you're not
                    my big brother...
          
          Chris hangs his head, frustrated.
          
          
          INT. JAIL CELL - AFTERNOON
          
          O'Dell stands at the bars of Dusty's jail cell. Dusty lies on
          his cot and stares up at the ceiling.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    You know what they do to faggot-ass
                    perverts like you in maximum
                    security, dontcha?
          
          O'Dell chuckles, enjoying this immensely.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                    Disgusting fuckin' piece a' shit
                    like you...
          
          
          EXT. POLICE STATION, BACK PARKING LOT - EVENING
          
          O'Dell, now dressed in plainclothes, is on the way to his CAR
          in the far corner of the back lot. He HEARS someone come out
          the door behind him, but doesn't turn until he HEARS his
          VOICE.
          
                              OFFICER HINES
                    Hey, O'Dell...
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    I'm on my way out... what do you
                    need?
          
                                                                   88.
          
          
          Hines catches up with him and they walk and talk.
          
                              OFFICER HINES
                    I'm not gonna bullshit ya.
          
                               OFFICER O'DELL
                    Okay...
          
                              OFFICER HINES
                    I saw you snatch the drugs outta
                    that house.
          
          O'Dell's face grows cold but he doesn't slow his pace.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    I don't think I know what the hell
                    you're talkin' about.
          
                              OFFICER HINES
                    Don't bullshit me either...
          
          Hines grabs his shoulder to stop him. O'Dell eyes his hand.
          
                              OFFICER HINES (CONT'D)
                    I don't wanna turn you in.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    Then what do you want?
          
                              OFFICER HINES
                    How much you think you'll get when
                    you unload it?
          
          O'Dell keeps cool, but resents being muscled.
          
                               OFFICER O'DELL
                    Depends.
          
                              OFFICER HINES
                    I'll take forty percent this time,
                    but from now on it's fifty-fifty.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    What do you mean from now on?
          
                              OFFICER HINES
                    I got a pretty good idea this ain't
                    the first time you done this. Won't
                    be the last, will it?
          
          Hines extends his hand and smiles. O'Dell shakes it.
          Grudgingly...
          
                                                                  89.
          
          
          After Hines turns on him and jogs back to the station house,
          O'Dell kicks the ground angrily.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    Shit!
          
          When he looks up, he's startled by a pair of eyes that peer
          from the bushes nearby. Upon closer inspection, he sees that
          it's Vietnam Tom in his SKI MASK.
          
          Nervous about how much he's heard, O'Dell takes an aggressive
          stance.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                    Come on outta there. Now!
          
          He becomes tense when Tom emerges, because he sees that he's
          got his RIFLE.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                    What the fuck you doin' carryin'
                    that around in the town proper?
          
          O'Dell realizes that he's not holding it in a threatening
          manner, but cradling it in his arms.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                    Hand it over. Right now!
          
          Tom steps toward him ever so slowly. O'Dell reaches out and
          Tom hands him the gun, stock first.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                    I should arrest you and throw you
                    in jail, you know that? Crazy
                    sonofabitch...
          
          Tom looks at the ground, hunched over meekly.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                    Get the fuck outta my sight.
          
          O'Dell looks around as Tom shuffles off, making sure no one
          witnessed the transaction.
          
          
          EXT. LOOKOUT - SUNSET
          
          Sam trudges up the wooded hill to the vantage point, carrying
          The Philosophy of Time Travel book. It's quiet and peaceful,
          and everything's bathed in golden light.
          
                                                                  90.
          
          
          EXT. LOOKOUT, VIETNAM TOM'S SQUATTING GROUND - SUNSET
          
          She comes upon Tom's new squatting ground in a secluded area
          near the lookout, and looks around before approaching.
          
          When she sees the handmade BUNNY MASK lying among his things,
          she puts the book under her arm and reaches down to pick it
          up.
          
          She runs her fingers down the long, shiny ears, nose, and
          jagged teeth...
          
          She doesn't realize that Tom is standing close behind her.
          When she senses his presence she's startled.
          
                               SAM
                    Sorry...
          
          She sets the BUNNY MASK down where she found it. Tom says
          nothing. He seems neither surprised nor irritated to find her
          there. He walks up beside her and sits, facing the view.
          
          After a long beat, Sam sits down beside him. To her surprise,
          Tom begins to speak:
          
                               VIETNAM TOM
                    My mom told me someday everybody
                    would understand. She said it was
                    my job to look out for the town...
                    so that's what I do. That's what I
                    always do.
          
          Sam listens to him intently.
          
                              VIETNAM TOM (CONT'D)
                    They don't know why. They don't
                    even want me here, but I still have
                    to protect them.
          
                              SAM
                    They're lucky to have someone to
                    protect them.
          
                              VIETNAM TOM
                    I'm used to it... I'm lucky to have
                    a job to do. Some people don't have
                    any reason to be here at all.
          
                              SAM
                    I know what you mean...
          
          Tom turns and looks at her strangely.
          
                                                                  91.
          
          
                              VIETNAM TOM
                    You're more important than all of
                    us.
          
          Sam peers into Tom's pale blue eyes through his ski mask.
          Without knowing why, she reaches out and touches the mask...
          
          When she starts to pull it off Tom grabs her hand, stopping
          her -- not too rough, but forceful.
          
          Sam's scared for a moment, but Tom lets her go. His eyes
          drift down to The Philosophy of Time Travel book by her side.
          Sam sees him staring, so she picks it up and hands it to him.
          
          When Tom sees the cover, his cold eyes are filled with
          emotion. Sam sees how struck he is, but doesn't understand.
          
                              SAM
                    Do you like to read?
          
          Tom says nothing.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    You can borrow it...
          
          Again, Tom does not speak. After a beat, Sam gets up slowly
          and walks away, leaving Tom with the book.
          
          
          INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
          
          Jeremy is at the department store in the FIRST AID SECTION,
          picking out some GAUZE and DISINFECTANT. When he looks down
          the aisle and sees Sam, he moves toward her quickly...
          
          He disturbs her while she's looking at some FEMININE HYGIENE
          PRODUCTS.
          
                              JEREMY
                    Sam...
          
          When he sees the items that she's shopping for, he seems much
          more embarrassed than she does.
          
                              SAM
                    Oh, hi Jeremy.
          
                              JEREMY
                    Hi... sorry.
          
                              SAM
                    That's okay, what's up?
          
                                                           92.
          
          
                               JEREMY
                    Nothing... just that I haven't see
                    you around for the past few days. I
                    was worried. I thought you might've
                    taken off.
          
                              SAM
                    No... I've been around. Going for
                    lots of walks.
          
                              JEREMY
                    I stopped by the motel.
          
          Sam finds his manner a bit odd.
          
                              SAM
                    Like I said, I've been in and out.
          
                               JEREMY
                    Well, there's something I wanted to
                    ask you. You know that book you
                    mentioned?
          
                              SAM
                    Yeah...
          
                              JEREMY
                    I'd really love to check it out.
          
                              SAM
                    Oh...
          
          Sam's face darkens, and Jeremy picks up on it.
          
                              JEREMY
                    You said you'd show it to me
                    sometime, and I've got a hunch it
                    could really help me in some of my
                    studies related to-
          
                              SAM
                    I don't have it anymore.
          
                              JEREMY
                    What?
          
                              SAM
                    I kind of... gave it to someone.
          
                              JEREMY
                    To who? Why?
          
                                                                    93.
          
          
                              SAM
                    I'm sorry. I just... forgot that I
                    said you could borrow it, and this
                    GUY-
          
                                JEREMY
                    What guy?
          
                              SAM
                    Well... that Vietnam Tom guy.
          
          Jeremy is furious.
          
                              JEREMY
                    Vietnam Tom!? You gave away the
                    book to Vietnam Tom!?
          
          Sam backs away from him. He's getting louder and out of
          control.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    I don't fucking believe what you're
                    telling me!
          
                              SAM
                    It's just a book...
          
                              JEREMY
                    He's a fucking bum! And you chose
                    him over me!?
          
                              SAM
                    No... I just-
          
          Suddenly, a hand comes down on Jeremy's shoulder. He turns
          and finds Chris standing behind him.
          
                              CHRIS
                    That's enough.
          
          Sam is relieved. Jeremy glares at Chris.
          
                              JEREMY
                    This is none of your business.
          
                              CHRIS
                    It is, actually. You're disturbing
                    my customers. Get out.
          
          Jeremy brushes past Sam as he leaves, and she and Chris are
          left alone. There's a definite "I told you so" aura.
          
                                                                  94.
          
          
                              SAM
                        (MUTTERING)
                    You didn't have to do that.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Just doin' my job.
          
          Sam starts to walk away, at first forgetting the products she
          needed. She comes back to get them, slightly flustered. Chris
          turns and leaves her in peace.
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                        (as he's walking away)
                    You're welcome.
          
          
          INT. FATHER HOMEIJER'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON
          
          Father Homeijer and Trudy are sitting on the couch in the
          living room of his quaint house, sharing a BOTTLE OF
          CHAMPAGNE.
          
                              TRUDY
                    I never had any doubts in you, or
                    in the Lord.
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                    I know that. And we both truly
                    appreciate all your faith and hard
                    work...
          
          They sip their champagne. Trudy glows.
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER (CONT'D)
                    We needed a miracle, but we got two
                    instead.
          
          Trudy grabs the bottle and tries to refill his glass, but the
          priest puts his hand over it.
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER (CONT'D)
                    I think I've had enough.
          
                              TRUDY
                    One more glass won't hurt you. You
                    deserve it, Father...
          
          
          I/E. O'DELL'S CAR/ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
          
          O'DELL'S CAR pulls up to an old warehouse and parks.
          
                              OFFICER HINES
                    Where the hell are they?
          
                                                                  95.
          
          
          Hines is nervous. He lights a cigarette.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    They'll be here. Just take it easy.
          
          
          EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - LATE NIGHT
          
          Tom wears his metal BUNNY MASK. Sam wears her HOODED
          SWEATSHIRT and JEANS, and her right hand is BANDAGED. The
          METAL SHARD is embedded under the skin of her forehead...
          
          They move slowly and methodically until they reach the center
          of the empty lot. There are lights on in the closed
          department store, but the parking lot is mostly dark.
          
                              VIETNAM TOM
                    Why do you talk to me?
          
          TOM'S VOICE is MUFFLED behind his mask.
          
                              SAM
                    Same reason you talk to me...
          
          Tom cocks his head, unsure of the answer.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    Because I can see how special you
                    are.
          
                              VIETNAM TOM
                    Why can't other people?
          
                              SAM
                    They will. Only one day left.
          
          They both turn toward an area in the lot where the SHOPPING
          CARTS are stored. The METAL STORAGE RACK starts to tremble
          and burn with COSMIC ENERGY...
          
          
          INT. FATHER HOMEIJER'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON
          
          Father Homeijer finishes his glass of champagne. Trudy is
          already done with hers, and she takes his glass and sets it
          on the coffee table. She moves closer to him on the couch...
          
                               FATHER HOMEIJER
                    Trudy...
          
          She puts her hand on his leg.
          
                                                                    96.
          
          
                              TRUDY
                    I see the way you look at me,
                    Father...
          
          She moves in closer... He looks uncomfortable.
          
                              TRUDY (CONT'D)
                    I want you too.
          
          She's about to kiss him, but Father Homeijer stops her.
          
                              TRUDY (CONT'D)
                    I can't do this. I'm a man of the
                    cloth... and you'd regret it.
          
          He takes her by the hand, reminding her of the WEDDING BAND
          on her finger.
          
          
          EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - LATE NIGHT
          
          SHOPPING CARTS start to roll out of the RACK by themselves,
          following their own liquid VECTOR SPEARS.
          
          Tom stands staring at them. He is flanked by Sam...
          
          
          EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
          
          Officer Hines walks to the edge of the woods beside the
          warehouse and unzips his pants...
          
          
          ANGLE: O'DELL'S CAR
          
          With GLOVED HANDS, O'Dell grabs VIETNAM TOM'S RIFLE out of
          the trunk...
          
          
          INT. FATHER HOMEIJER'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON
          
          Trudy's head is buried in her hands and she bawls.
          
                              TRUDY
                    I feel like such an idiot...
          
          Father Homeijer doesn't know what to say.
          
          
          EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
          
          Hines finishes relieving himself and comes out into the open
          from the side of the building. O'Dell is waiting for him.
          
                                                                    97.
          
          
                              OFFICER HINES
                    What the fuck-
          
          BOOM!
          
          O'Dell shoots him in the chest. He is cool and calm. He
          throws the rifle down on the ground...
          
          
          EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - LATE NIGHT
          
          The SHOPPING CARTS whirl in an circle of ever-increasing
          speed around Vietnam Tom and Sam. The RUBBER WHEELS squeal on
          the cement until they start to melt...
          
          The VECTOR SPEARS lead the carts in a spiral that hones in
          closer and closer to the two of them. Sam is stoic. Tom is in
          awe...
          
          
          EXT. THE ETHER - NIGHT - POV INSIDE PORTAL
          
          We travel at breath-taking speed through a PORTAL as it
          weaves through millions of STARS, then an ATMOSPHERIC
          BARRIER...
          
          
          EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - LATE NIGHT
          
          When it looks like they'll be crushed by the scudding metal,
          or combusted by the cosmic energy, the WORM-LIKE PORTAL from
          the sky reaches down and encloses Tom and Sam like a vacuum.
          
          There's a brilliant FLASH OF LIGHT -- TRANSITION TO:
          
          
          EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - THE NEXT MORNING
          
          CHRIS' TRUCK pulls into the lot early in the morning, and he
          gets out wearing his work uniform. Still groggy, he's about
          to walk into the store when something catches his eye...
          
          CRANE UP to FIND a STRUCTURE made of all the SHOPPING CARTS,
          as chilling and impressive as a crop circle, in the shape of
          an immense FIBONACCI SPIRAL. The metal of the carts has been
          fused together, and they're stacked in an ascending manner
          that reaches an apex in the center, like a cone.
          
          Chris is mystified... CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. STREET - DAY
          
          Two POLICE CRUISERS speed down a street in town...
          
                                                                  98.
          
          
          EXT. PARK - AFTERNOON
          
          COPS, including Officer O'Dell, converge on Vietnam Tom in
          the park, where he sits on the SWING in his ski mask...
          
                              COP #1
                    Get down on the ground!
          
          Tom looks up at them calmly, without fear.
          
                              COP #1 (CONT'D)
                    Get down on the ground, now!
          
          He obeys them and two Cops jump on him and put him in cuffs.
          One of them pulls up his head and rips off his ski mask --
          
          Tom's face is a mass of SCARS. Both his cheeks, forehead and
          chin are marred by scar tissue born from long, deep gashes.
          
          O'Dell looks into his sad, blue eyes...
          
          
          INT. POLICE STATION, VARIOUS - AFTERNOON
          
          Tom is slammed against a table. An OFFICER takes his hand
          roughly and sticks his fingers into some ink to take his
          prints -- JUMP CUT TO:
          
                                 POLICEMAN (V.O.)
                    Name?
          
          Tom stands for his booking photos -- JUMP CUT TO:
          
                              POLICEMAN (CONT'D)
                        (getting angry)
                    What's your name?
          
          The POLICEMAN stands over Vietnam Tom, who sits defeated in a
          chair. A YOUNG OFFICER approaches.
          
                              YOUNG OFFICER
                    We found this on him...
          
          He passes the Policeman a set of DOG TAGS on a CHAIN. The
          name on the tags is: THOMAS WARD SPARROW.
          
          
          EXT. MOTEL - EVENING
          
          Sam walks toward the motel, wearing JEANS and a T-SHIRT...
          
          When she sees JEREMY'S BMW parked in the lot she stops short.
          But it's too late -- he's already seen her and is getting out
          of the car. He's got a bouquet of FLOWERS.
          
                                                          99.
          
          
                                 JEREMY
                    Hi, Sam...
          
          He passes her the flowers.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    I hope you can forgive the way I
                    acted.
          
                              SAM
                    That was pretty weird.
          
                              JEREMY
                    I know. I just...
          
          Jeremy is awkward and shy.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    I've been so wrapped up with the
                    meteorite. I haven't been eating or
                    sleeping much. I think I'm just
                    drained... but that's no excuse.
          
                              SAM
                    It's alright.
          
                              JEREMY
                    I was wondering if you'd let me
                    make it up to you.
          
                              SAM
                    You don't need to-
          
                              JEREMY
                    Please... let me take you to watch
                    the fireworks tonight.
          
                              SAM
                    I don't think so.
          
                              JEREMY
                    It's gonna be spectacular. There's
                    gonna be a meteor shower that
                    coincides with the show... I mean,
                    how often does that happen?
          
          Sam still isn't sure.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    I just wanna be your friend.
          
                              SAM
                    I was supposed to see `em with
                    Chris, but... he's stuck at work.
          
                                                                   100.
          
          
                              JEREMY
                    So, what do you say? Will you go
                    with me?
          
                              SAM
                    Gimme a sec. Lemme grab my
                    sweatshirt...
          
          Jeremy beams.
          
          
          EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - EVENING
          
          Chris is in the department store parking lot with a crew of
          EMPLOYEES. They work together to pry apart the numerous
          SHOPPING CARTS with CROWBARS. They've made some progress, but
          still a long way to go.
          
          Chris is distracted by JEREMY'S BMW as it cruises through the
          nearby intersection...
          
          After it passes, Chris looks up at some OMINOUS CLOUDS
          congregating in the darkening sky.
          
          From the CLOUDS above the store -- PAN DOWN TO FIND:
          
          
          EXT. LOOKOUT - EVENING
          
          The lookout, and Jeremy's car riding up the hill. There are
          OTHER CARS parked to watch the upcoming display, but Jeremy
          drives to a more SECLUDED AREA... (Music suggestion: 4th of
          July, by Soundgarden.)
          
          
          EXT. WOODED GROVE NEARBY - EVENING
          
          Jeremy spreads a blanket on the ground of a private grove. He
          wears a LIGHT JACKET, and sets down a GROCERY BAG. Sam has
          her HOODED SWEATSHIRT tied around her waist.
          
                              SAM
                    Shouldn't we go back out there
                    where we can see?
          
                              JEREMY
                    No, this'll be perfect. See right
                    there?
          
          He points to an area near the tops of the trees.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    That's right where the fireworks'll
                    come up.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                 101.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    And we can see the meteors better
                    without all the lights from the
                    town.
          
          Sam sits down on the blanket and checks her watch. Jeremy
          pokes around in the grocery bag.
          
                              SAM
                    So what's in the bag?
          
                              JEREMY
                    You'll see...
          
          Sam takes her HOODED SWEATSHIRT from around her waist and
          puts it on to fight the cold...
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    There's one!
          
          Sam spots a METEOR as it streaks across the sky --
          
          
          EXT. WOODED GROVE NEARBY - LATER - NIGHT
          
          JEREMY'S HAND holds a flaring ROMAN CANDLE --
          
                              JEREMY (O.S.)
                    Here it goes!
          
          A SPARKLING GREEN BALL shoots out of the stick into the air.
          Sam looks up at it and smiles. Jeremy shoots off colorful
          ball after ball, aiming in different directions.
          
                              SAM
                    They're pretty.
          
          After his stick fizzles out:
          
                              JEREMY
                    You wanna try one?
          
          Sam shrugs... He grabs another out of the grocery bag, and
          Sam gets up slowly. He passes her the ROMAN CANDLE, and she
          accepts it with her RIGHT HAND...
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    Just hold it straight up.
          
          Sam holds it and Jeremy flicks his LIGHTER. The WICK
          catches...
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    It's goin'!
          
                                                                   102.
          
          
          Sam smiles and holds the stick as far away from her face as
          possible. She closes her eyes...
          
          But the wick burns down extremely fast. The FIRST BALL gets
          stuck at the top and implodes, causing the whole thing to
          catch fire.
          
                               SAM
                    Ow!
          
                               JEREMY
                    Drop it!
          
          He runs over and stamps it out as quickly as he can...
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    Fucking faulty one...
          
          Sam nurses her burned hand.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    Are you okay?
          
                              SAM
                    I think so...
          
          Jeremy inspects her hand -- there's a large BLISTER.
          
                              JEREMY
                    You need to get that covered...
          
          Jeremy takes off his jacket. He then removes his T-shirt and
          starts to tear off a piece.
          
                              SAM
                    What are you doing?
          
                              JEREMY
                    It's okay...
          
          
          EXT. BANK - NIGHT
          
          The bank sign shows 8:59 PM. The display flashes to: JULY 4,
          1995... It changes to the countdown: 00 DAYS, 00 HOURS, 00
          MINUTES, 03 SECONDS... 02 SECONDS... 01 SECONDS...
          
          
          EXT. WOODED GROVE NEARBY - NIGHT
          
          Jeremy finishes wrapping the piece of his T-shirt around
          Sam's hand, creating the MAKESHIFT BANDAGE.
          
                                                                 103.
          
          
                              JEREMY
                    How's it feel?
          
                              SAM
                    A little better...
          
          The FIREWORKS suddenly begin, and fill the sky above the
          grove with bursts of bright, multi-colored lights. Sporadic
          METEORS rain down at the same time. It's magnificent.
          
          After a beat, Sam looks over at Jeremy...
          
          The fireworks illuminate his torso, and she is appalled to
          see that the raw, reddish RASH has spread to cover the
          greater part of it.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    Good God...
          
          Jeremy looks down as if he'd forgotten, then quickly picks up
          his jacket and puts it back on.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                        (ALARMED)
                    Is that from the meteorite?
          
                              JEREMY
                    I barely even notice it anymore.
                    I'm sure it'll go away soon.
          
          He zips up his jacket tight.
          
                              SAM
                    Are you fucking kidding me?
          
                              JEREMY
                    Do you think I'm disgusting?
          
          The question takes Sam by surprise.
          
                              SAM
                    No... I just think you should get
                    it looked at-
          
          Before Sam can finish, Jeremy crams his mouth into hers for a
          forceful kiss...
          
          Sam shoves him away sharply.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    What the hell are you doing?
          
                                                                   104.
          
          
                              JEREMY
                    So you do find me disgusting. Which
                    is it, Sam, I can't take much more
                    of this shit!
          
                              SAM
                    Jesus Christ...
          
          He tries to grab her, but Sam turns and runs --
          
                                 JEREMY
                    Come here!
          
          
          EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
          
          Sam tears through the woods, Jeremy close behind her. The
          FIREWORKS CRACK and POP in the sky above...
          
                                 JEREMY
                    Sam! Stop!
          
          Sam jumps over a fallen log in the dark... Jeremy hits it
          dead on with his shins and goes head over heels --
          
                                 JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    FUCK!
          
          He picks himself up and charges even faster --
          
          
          INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT
          
          Tom sits alone in his jail cell, morose, staring at the
          floor. He looks up when he senses someone approaching...
          
          
          EXT. LOOKOUT, VIETNAM TOM'S SQUATTING GROUND - NIGHT
          
          Sam sprints by the area of Vietnam Tom's squatting ground.
          FIREWORKS continue to EXPLODE and shower overhead, and some
          PEOPLE can be HEARD LAUGHING and SHOUTING from the main
          parking area, not far away...
          
          Sam runs toward the VOICES --
          
          But Jeremy grabs her from behind and spins her around!
          
                              SAM
                    Why are you doing this?
          
                              JEREMY
                    I just wanna talk to you!
          
                                                                 105.
          
          
          She struggles against his grip. The EXPLOSIONS and the RUCKUS
          from CROWD mask their noise.
          
                               JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    Stop it!
          
          Sam raises her knee and connects hard with his groin. He
          starts to double over, but recovers quickly and smacks her
          across the face --
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    Fucking bitch!
          
          Sam is stunned, and Jeremy takes her by the shoulders and
          shoves her hard --
          
          Sam stumbles backwards and falls, cracking her head on the
          metal BUNNY MASK. She rolls over onto her back, REVEALING the
          SHARD OF METAL that protrudes from the GASH by her temple...
          
          She struggles no more.
          
          
          INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT
          
          Tom stands in his cell to meet the entity that approaches...
          
          
          EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT
          
          Chris and the other Employees stop working and look up at the
          sky, now roiling with sinister, SUPERNATURAL CLOUDS...
          
          
          EXT. LOOKOUT, VIETNAM TOM'S SQUATTING GROUND - NIGHT
          
          Jeremy slowly creeps to where Sam lies... Her eyes are open
          and she is completely still.
          
                               JEREMY
                    Sam?...
          
          Jeremy crouches beside her, and when he puts two fingers to
          her neck to feel for a pulse, he starts to tremble...
          
          The raining METEORS and FIREWORKS illuminate the SMOKE and
          the BLACK CLOUDS overhead...
          
          
          INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT
          
          Vietnam Tom walks up to the CELL BARS...
          
          He comes face to face with Sam.
          
                                                                  106.
          
          
          She stares back at him through the bars from the other side.
          She wears her HOODED SWEATSHIRT and the BANDAGE. Light glints
          off the METAL lodged in her HEAD WOUND.
          
          
          I/E. JEREMY'S BMW/LOOKOUT - NIGHT
          
          Jeremy speeds frantically down the hill, away from the
          parking area and the continuing fireworks display. Tears
          stream down his cheeks...
          
          He cuts the wheel when a pair of HEADLIGHTS blind him and a
          vehicle cuts him off. His car skids out, and he sees it's
          CHRIS' TRUCK that has almost hit him.
          
          Chris jumps out, yanks open Jeremy's door and grabs him by
          the shirt collar. He yells over the FIREWORKS:
          
                              CHRIS
                    Where the hell is Sam?
          
                              JEREMY
                        (FRANTIC)
                    I don't know... I don't know...
          
          Jeremy stomps on the gas pedal, and Chris is forced to unhand
          him as his BMW navigates around the truck and barrels down
          the hill...
          
          
          EXT. LOOKOUT, VIETNAM TOM'S SQUATTING GROUND - LATER - NIGHT
          
          As Chris approaches Vietnam Tom's squatting ground, the
          FIREWORKS DISPLAY is in the midst of the GRANDE FINALE.
          Showers of light BURST and CRACKLE in steady succession.
          PEOPLE SCREAM in approval from the parking area nearby...
          
          Chris comes upon Sam's lifeless form.
          
                              CHRIS
                    No...
          
          He stoops by her, picks her up and hugs her limp body
          close...
          
          As he does this, Vietnam Tom approaches from behind him.
          Chris turns to face him but says nothing, still holding Sam.
          The WIND picks up and blows in gusts around them...
          
          Tom looks down at the two of them for a moment, then reaches
          down and picks up his BUNNY MASK. The EVIL GRIN is red with
          SAM'S BLOOD, and one of the teeth is missing...
          
                                                                    107.
          
          
          The last of the fireworks display occurs, leaving the night
          full of SMOKE, HELLISH CLOUDS and an increasing number of
          bright-tailed METEORS -- the APOCALYPSE.
          
          Amongst the churning clouds, a tornado-like PORTAL cuts
          through the sky and touches down somewhere in the town. It's
          swirling and vast, stretching down from limitless space...
          
                              SAM (V.O.)
                    15 days... 18 hours...
          
          Tom puts on the BUNNY MASK...
          
               SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)                 VIETNAM TOM
          45 minutes... 6 seconds...      45 minutes... 6 seconds...
          
          And focuses on a single METEOR that plummets toward the
          yawning VORTEX, using telekinetic power to guide it...

          The clock on the BANK SIGN shows 3:30 AM -- then flashes to --
          JUNE 19, 1995... It changes again, this time to a countdown
          to the JULY 4TH FIREWORKS CELEBRATION: 15 DAYS, 17 HOURS, 29
          MINUTES, 57 SECONDS... 56 SECONDS... 55 SECONDS...

          INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - NIGHT
          
          Sam awakens suddenly from a nightmare. She lies atop the
          blankets wearing a T-SHIRT and BOXER SHORTS. She looks over
          and sees Corey passed out on the other full-size bed.
          
          TWO PLASTIC CUPS, EMPTY SODA CANS, and the BOTTLE are on the
          nightstand between them, the liquor partially consumed. The
          CLOCK/RADIO reads 3:30 AM.
          
          
          EXT. WINDMILL PLATFORM - NIGHT
          
          Vietnam Tom sits atop the platform, more than 30 feet up,
          wearing his ski mask and holding his rifle. The surface of
          the platform is littered with TATTERED CLOTHING, a WATER
          BOTTLE, CANS OF FOOD and SCRAPS OF A TARP.
          
          Relaxed and at peace, Tom looks up to the clear night sky. As
          a TREMOR starts to build, he takes off his ski mask and gazes
          out over his town...
          
          He smiles.
          
          Suddenly, there's a brilliant flash of GREEN LIGHT --
          deafening THUNDER -- a blinding EXPLOSION -- CUT TO:
          
          
          CHARACTER MONTAGE
          
          Dusty sits and stares at his CELLAR DOOR... Trudy holds a
          PICTURE OF FATHER HOMEIJER and cries... Ruth snorts some COKE
          in her room... Jeremy scratches his LEFT FOREARM in his
          sleep... Billy Moorcroft shivers from the chill in his
          CAGE... Officer O'Dell sits alone in his patrol car,
          fingering the trigger of his PISTOL... TRANSITION TO:
          
          
          EXT. FIELD BEHIND MOTEL - THE NEXT MORNING
          
          Where the towering windmill once stood is now only a CRATER
          about 5 feet deep and 10 feet in diameter, with charred bits
          of wood and metal strewn everywhere. Ground water spurts from
          the broken well seal.
          
          A cantaloupe-sized METEORITE sits in the center of the
          crater...
          
          Two FIREMEN haul out the meteorite as Sam and O'Dell arrive
          on the scene. There are PARAMEDICS, a CORONER and other
          POLICEMEN there as well, and a large area has been cordoned
          off with POLICE TAPE.
          
                                                                 109.
          
          
          Corey is there looking on, as well as Chris Holt, Phil
          Coulter, and other local CITIZENS. TOM'S REMAINS are carried
          off in a BLACK BAG...
          
                              SAM
                    Oh my God...
          
          Sam moves to stand by Corey. The overall mood is grim, and
          Frank stands peering at the wreckage with a long face.
          
                              FRANK
                    I don't believe it...
          
          The Firemen drop the porous, misshapen clod by his feet.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    This is just a tragedy.
          
          Officer O'Dell steps up beside him and kicks the meteorite
          with his boot.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    Sell that thing off to some
                    meteorologist nerd club, I bet you
                    could do okay.
          
                              FRANK
                    Do I look like the type of guy
                    that's gonna try and profit off
                    another man's death? You should be
                    ashamed of yourself.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                        (EMBARRASSED)
                    I was just sayin'...
          
          Sam looks down on the ground and sees Tom's multi-colored SKI
          MASK...
          
          She picks it up.
          
                              COREY
                    What are you doing?
          
          As she caresses the fibers with her fingers, she is filled
          with unwarranted emotion...
          
          
          EXT. MOTEL - MORNING
          
          Sam and Corey are on their way back to the motel room when
          they turn and see that Chris has followed them.
          
                                                                 110.
          
          
                                 CHRIS
                    Hey...
          
                                 SAM
                    Hey.
          
                              CHRIS
                    So you guys stayed here last night?
          
                              COREY
                    One of us did.
          
          Sam gives Corey a look. Chris decides to ignore the comment.
          
                              CHRIS
                    What's up with your car?
          
                              COREY
                    It's gonna take a couple days.
          
                              CHRIS
                    For a water pump?
          
          Sam and Corey shrug.
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    It's none of my business, but...
          
          He's distracted when JEREMY'S BMW pulls up and parks. He hops
          out and hustles across the field toward the crash site...
          
                                 SAM
                    What?
          
          Chris regains his train of thought:
          
                              CHRIS
                    I was just gonna say, if you
                    wanted, I could give you a ride
                    back.
          
          He looks right at Sam when he says this. He then glances over
          at Corey, as if just remembering that she were there.
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    You too. I mean, I could give you
                    both a ride.
          
                              COREY
                    To Middlesex, Virginia? Do you-
          
                              SAM
                        (INTERRUPTING)
                    I'll go.
          
                                                                 111.
          
          
                              COREY
                        (PISSED)
                    What?
          
                              SAM
                    I think I wanna go.
          
                              COREY
                    Things get a little tough, you're
                    just gonna give up?
          
                              SAM
                    It's not like that... You should
                    come too.
          
                              COREY
                    Fuck that. I'll wait for my car and
                    stick to the plan. Do whatever the
                    fuck you want.
          
          Corey turns and goes inside the room.
          
                               SAM
                    Corey...
          
          Sam looks back to Chris, who is uncomfortable for causing the
          conflict.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Sorry to screw you guys up.
          
                              SAM
                    It's alright. She can take care of
                    herself... she's good at it. I've
                    gotta go home.
          
          
          INT. FRANK'S BARN - DAY
          
          The METEORITE sits in a dark corner of the barn, collecting
          dust...
          
          
          INT. CHRIS' TRUCK - DAY
          
          Sam leans her head against the window of Chris' truck as they
          cruise along the highway...
          
          She gazes up at the bright, open sky.

INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

A MAN recumbent on the bed, playing a TRUMPET, his white dress shirt 
defaced by a flower of blood.  The room is ON FIRE all around him.

He is playing Miles Davis' moody, Spanish-influenced SAETA, a haunting 
and lonely piece.

                             DANNY (V.O.)
                  My name is Tom Van Allen ...
                       (beat)
                  or Danny Flynne ...

A DUFFLE BAG FULL OF MONEY ON THE BED.  The money burning, tiny flaming 
pieces floating around the room.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  ... I don't know anymore.
                       (beat)
                  Maybe I'll let you decide.  Maybe you
                  can help me, friend.  As you can see,
                  I don't have a hell of a lot of time left.

A PHOTOGRAPH of a woman taped to the inside of a trumpet case. The 
photo is on fire.  Only her smile remains.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Avenging angel ... Judas Iscariot ...
                  Loving husband ... Prodigal Son ...
                  The prince of Denmark ...?

A GREETING CARD on the floor, a teddy bear and the word, 
CONGRATULATIONS! on the front.  The wind from the fire blows the card 
open.  Inside, a BLACKENED BLOOD STAIN.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  All of these? None of these? You
                  decide, friend.  You decide. Trumpet
                  player? Speed freak?
                       (beat)
                  Speed freak.
                       (beat)
                  That's as good a place as any.
                       (beat)
                  But first, a little background on the
                  mad world of the tweaker ..


                                                          FADE OUT.

                                                          FADE IN.


INT. LABORATORY - DAY

EXTREME CLOSE-UP of a glass pipette dripping a clear liquid into a 
glass beaker.

                             DANNY (V.O.)
                  Methedrene was first distilled by a
                  Japanese scientist before WWII.
                  Hand it to the Japanese, they knew a
                  good thing when they saw it.

INT. JAPANESE ZERO - DAY

A wide-eyed, jaw-grinding KAMIKAZE PILOT with a death-grip on the 
controls.

                             DANNY (V.O.)
                  This guy's so tweaked, he probably thinks
                  he can survive this without a scratch.

STOCK BATTLE FOOTAGE - a Japanese Zero crashes into a battleship, 
bursting into a ball of flames.

                             DANNY (V.O.)
                  Maybe not.
                       (beat)
                  By some estimates, 2% of the Japanese
                  population had a meth problem after
                  the war: factory workers, soldiers,
                  pilots.  Maybe that's why it took two
                  bombs to get 'em to surrender.  A
                  nuclear blast is just a minor
                  nuisance to a determined tweaker.

INT. HOUSE - DAY

A wide-eyed, June Cleaveresque housewife in a picture-perfect white 
dress vacuums the floor of a picture-perfect house.

                             DANNY (V.O)
                  In the fifties, the housewives got
                  ahold of it.  Dexedrine. Benzedrine.
                  Methedrene ...

She attacks the same spot over and over again, one hand clutching the 
vacuum, the other stiffly holding a cigarette.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Now that's a classic speed freak for
                  you, skinny and cleaning the house.  I'll
                  bet her poor husband never knew what
                  hit him in the sack either.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

THE LEG OF THE BED rattling and bouncing loudly off the floor.

STOCK FOOTAGE - J.F.K. pumping the hand of NIKITA KRUSCHEV.

                             DANNY (V.O.)
                  There were even rumors that one of
                  our presidents dabbled with
                  mysterious "energy shots".  Imagine
                  that: a slammer in the White House.

Kennedy talking animatedly.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  If it's true, I'll bet ol' Krushchev
                  never got a word in edgewise.

EXT. TRUCK STOP PARKING LOT - NIGHT

A sleepy-eyed TRUCKER emerges from his tractor-trailer and approaches a 
loitering HELL'S ANGELS-type.

                             DANNY (V.O.)
                  By the late 60's the government
                  finally cracked down and sent the
                  whole thing underground.  Bikers
                  controlled the market for a while.

INT.  TRACTOR-TRAILER - NIGHT

The trucker gripping the wheel with the same death-grip as the 
Kamikaze.

                             DANNY (V.O.)
                  But now anyone with a basic chemistry
                  kit and the right ingredients can
                  cook it up at home.

INT. PHARMACY - NIGHT

A CASHIER scanning container after container of COLD MEDICATION.

                             DANNY (V.O.)
                  Ever see a long-haired tattooed freak
                  buying up all the cold medicine he
                  can lay his hands on at three in the morning.

The cashier looks up at the aforementioned FREAK, a frozen grin 
plastered on his face.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Take it from me, he ain't got no
                  cold.  He's a cook.  Look in his
                  kitchen and you'll find a whole
                  grocery list of unsavory ingredients.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

TRACK DOWN the kitchen counter on various containers.

                             DANNY (V.O.)
                  Drain cleaner, hydrochloric acid,
                  match heads for red phosphorus,
                  ether and of course the cold
                  medicine .. that's for Ephedrene,
                  soon to become Methedrene

CONTINUE TRACKING to a series of BURNERS, BEAKERS and TUBING

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  This guy's a regular Julia Child.
                  Problem is, I'll be even Miss Julia
                  fucks up the bouillabaisse from time to time.

The freaky cook sees something he doesn't like. His eyes widen.


                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Oh-oh.

EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT

As the structure explodes.

INT. PARTY HOUSE - UNKNOWN

Thick blankets and tinfoil taped over the windows.

A huge container of empty beer cans, washed and neatly arranged.

Lines of crystal meth on a mirror as precisely arranged as Nails as the 
Nuremberg rally.

A GROUP OF TWEAKERS in the middle of a binge.

Two skinny women, NANCY and Teresa bent over a drawer-full of neatly 
folded socks on the living room floor.  They stare at the drawer as if 
they were pondering a Rembrandt.

                             NANCY
                  It ain't right

                             TERESA
                  You think?

                             NANCY
                  Something's off.

                             TERESA
                  We can do better.

They take the socks out and being rearranging them again.

Three guys squeezed onto a couch together: KUJO, JIMMY THE FINN and 
CREEPER.  Kujo is talking a blue-streak.  He makes Dennis Leary took 
mealy-mouthed.

Creeper and Jimmy stare straight ahead, clearly bugging.

                             KUJO
                  So the alphabet, I mean look at it,
                  there's 26 letters.  Why not 27 or 28
                  or 106?  And the vowels: a, e, i, o, u.
                  What the hell is up with that?


                             CREEPER
                  And sometimes y.

                             KUJO
                  What I'm saying is that I love it!
                  It's great. I could go on all night about it.

And he does.

                             KUJO (cont'd)
                  Let's take every letter individually.
                  I mean, let's really break the
                  mother's down.

DANNY is sitting in an armchair.  He is the only one who looks tired.  
He sits there, taking the scene in.

ALL SOUNDS FADE OUT

                             DANNY (V.O.)
                  And so this is where I find myself.
                  No. I should choose my words more
                  wisely: this is the world I sought
                  out.  The land of the perpetual night-
                  party.  Day swallowing night and
                  night swallowing day.  The crank
                  compressing time like some divine
                  piston on its awesome downstroke.

DANNY'S P.O.V. - SCANNING THE ROOM.  NO SOUND.  The girl's folding the 
socks ... Kujo ranting on ... Creeper and Jimmy the Finn grinding their 
jaws ... the BLANKETS AND TINFOIL ON THE WINDOWS.


                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  We've been at this for three days ...
                  or is it four?  Tweakerrs, lokers,
                  slammers coming and going, swearing
                  eternal allegiance and undying love
                  for one another, only to wake up
                  after the binge and realize you
                  wouldn't walk across the street to
                  piss on one of 'em if their head was on fire.
                       (beat)
                  Is it three days or is it four?

BACK ON DANNY. He blinks lethargically.


                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  I know what you're thinking. But
                  don't give up on me just yet.  And
                  for God's sake, don't pity me. Don't
                  make any judgments until you've seen
                  my whole story.
                       (beat)
                  And keep your eyes open.
                       (beat)
                  Nothing is what it seems.

Suddenly ...

                             KUJO (O.S.)
                  OH SHIT! WE'RE OUT OF DRUGS!

INT. PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT 

Danny and Jimmy the Finn walking towards the front door.

                             DANNY
                  How the hell did we get this detail?

                             JIMMY
                  Guess it's our turn.

Danny nods.

                             DANNY
                  What time is it?

                             JIMMY
                  Twelve

                             DANNY
                  Midnight?

EXT. PARTY HOUSE - DAY 

As the door opens, Danny discovers that it is TWELVE NOON and the sun 
is blazing.

The party house is revealed as a cheap stucco apartment building 
crammed in the middle of BUSY BUSINESS DISTRICT at a major 
intersection.

Jimmy and Danny slip on sunglasses and brave the light.

                             DANNY
                  Where to?

                             JIMMY
                  I know a guy.

                             DANNY
                  Lead the way.

They slink along like two albino rat vampires with sunglasses.

                             JIMMY
                  Nice day

                             DANNY
                  I hadn't noticed.
                       (beat)
                  I've seen you around.  What's your name?

                             JIMMY
                  Jimmy.  Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn.

                             DANNY
                  Why's that?

                             JIMMY
                  My features. They're Finnish.

                             DANNY
                  You don't say.

                             JIMMY
                  Finland is a country.

                             DANNY
                  Well, Jimmy the Finn, let's go score some gack.

INT. CHEAP MOTEL ROOM - DAY

Danny and Jimmy standing there looking at something OFF SCREEN.  Danny 
and Jimmy looking at one another, then back at what they were looking 
at.

A GUY sitting on the bed in his underwear, looking down at his left arm 
and holding a can of BUG SPRAY at the ready in his right hand.

He is completely motionless, studying his arm with hypnotic intensity.

                             JIMMY
                  Bobby?

                             BOBBY
                  Shhh.

Bobby never takes his eyes off his arm.

                             BOBBY (cont'd)
                       (whispering)
                  They're coming.

                             JIMMY
                       (likewise whispering)
                  What?

                             BOBBY
                  The spiders.

Bobby readies the can of bug spray, his eyes widening.

                             BOBBY (cont'd)
                       (sing-song)
                  I'm ready for you this time.

Bobby lets loose with the spray, dousing his arm.

                             BOBBY
                  Aha! Yeah!
                       (super rapid-fire)
                  You thought you could fuck with
                  Bobby, you thought you could fuck
                  with Bobby, you thought you could
                  fuck with Bobby!

Bobby's mouth wide with stupid joy and continues to cloud the air with 
bug spray.

                             BOBBY (cont'd)
                  With Bobby you thought you could fuck?

Danny and Jimmy wait silently.  Bobby finally stops spraying, satisfied 
he has killed the imaginary spiders.

He looks up at Jimmy and Danny, his eyes swimming with stupid, drug-
addled confusion.

                             BOBBY (cont'd)
                  Who the fuck are you?

                             JIMMY
                  It's me ... Jimmy

Bobby squints.

                             BOBBY
                  Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Rhymes with Simmy.

                             JIMMY
                  Yeah.

                             BOBBY
                  What can I do for you?

                             JIMMY
                  Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us.

Danny and Jimmy notice something simultaneously.

There is something under the mattress - A HUGE BULGE.

                             BOBBY
                  Don't pay her no mind.

A MUFFLED MOAN from under Bobby.  She is between the mattress and the 
box springs. 

                             BOBBY (cont'd)
                  Shut the hell up, goddamit!

Bobby starts slapping the top of the mattress with his hand.  New 
MUFFLED SCREAMS from underneath.

                             BOBBY (cont'd)
                  I got no vocation skills!  What the
                  fuck you want from me?
                       (keeps slapping)
                  I got no vocation skills!

                             JIMMY
                  Hey man, take it easy.

Bobby immediately stops.  Looks at Jimmy with incredulity.

                             BOBBY
                  What?

                             JIMMY
                  Come on.  Ease off the girl.

Bobby springs from the bed, grabbing something as he rises.

Danny and Jimmy suddenly staring at a SPEARGUN which is loaded with two 
stainless steel spears.

Bobby stands there alternately pointing the speargun at Jimmy, then 
Danny.

                             BOBBY
                  Did you bring the plastic men?

Bobby nods towards something behind Danny.  Danny and Jimmy don't move 
or speak.

                             BOBBY (cont'd)
                  Did you bring the plastic men?
                       (beat)
                  Did you bring the plastic men?

Bobby rubs his nose.

                             BOBBY
                  Did ... you ... bring ... the ... plastic ... men?

                             DANNY
                  Nah, we didn't bring 'em.  That's
                  just your good crank talking, brother.

Bobby tilts his head.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  We were hoping to catch a few ourselves
                  if you'll hook us up.

                             BOBBY
                       (calmer)
                  You bring the plastic men?

                             DANNY
                  Like I said.

                             JIMMY
                  Fuck man. Come on, Bobby.

                             BOBBY
                  Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.  Rhymes with ...
                       (he draws a blank)

                             DANNY
                  Hobby?

Bobby twists a smile, revealing speed-blackened teeth.

                             BOBBY
                  That's a good man. I like that.

                             DANNY
                       (calmly)
                  Hey, Bobby, look .. What you got
                  going with your old lay, it's none
                  of our business. We're just a couple
                  of dope fiends trying to score.

Bobby lowers his speargun.

                             BOBBY
                  Two eight balls?

Jimmy breaths a sigh of relief.

EXT. CHEAP MOTEL ROOM - DAY

Danny and Jimmy exit the room, closing the door behind them.  Danny 
looks at Jimmy.

                             DANNY
                  Nice dealer you got there, Jimmy.

                             JIMMY
                  Oh ... that.  Ah, he was just juiced.
                  He wouldn't have did nothin'

WHAP, WHAP! Two spears plunge through the cheap door, stopping inches 
from Danny's head.

They run like hell.

EXT. SKY - DAY

TIME LAPSE.  The sun plunges down.  The sky turns black.  The moon 
races up and down.  The sky lightens.  The sun races up and down.  
Night comes again.

INT. PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT

Everyone crashing.  Jonestown, post Kool-Aid.  It looks like they have 
all simultaneously fallen asleep where they were standing or sitting.

Danny stirs awake.  Looks around.  He stretches.  KNOCKING OVER A 
BOTTLE OF BEER.

ALL OTHER SOUND FADES OUT AS the beer SPLATTER to the floor.  IT IS 
UNNATURALLY LOUD.

DANNY staring intently at the spilling liquid.

The beer pools up on the floor.

Danny transfixed by the image.

The last few drops of beer LOUDLY splashing down.

EXT PAYPHONE - NIGHT

Danny on the phone.



                             DANNY
                  C.I. number 678-43K-107
                       (beat)
                  Tanner and Garcetti

He hangs up.

EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

Danny waiting in the shadows.

A car, sans headlights, pulls into the alley and stops.

Danny emerges from the shadows, opens the back door and lays on the 
back seat.

INT. CAR - SAME

Two guys in suits in the front, TANNER and GARCETTI.  Tanner. blue eyes 
and SHAVED HEAD, an air of ex-military around him.  Garcetti: swarthly 
and serious, a MIASMA OF BAD-ASS ATTITUDE.

                             DANNY
                       (lying on the back seat)
                  I've got a hot one.

                             TANNER
                  You go, boy.

                             DANNY
                  If it's all the same to you, I'd
                  rather not dish right here in the
                  middle of Crankville.

Tanner drives out of the alley.

                             TANNER
                  Feeling the paranoia tonight, are we?

                             DANNY
                  Well, you know what they say, just
                  because you're paranoid, doesn't mean
                  everyone's not out to slice your
                  balls off and shove 'em down your throat.

EXT. PART - NIGHT

Danny, Tanner and Garcetti outside the car in a deserted park. Danny 
pacing.

                             TANNER
                  You got a name?

                             DANNY
                  Bobby, rhymes with hobby.

                             TANNER
                  What?

                             DANNY
                  Never mind.  Dude had a backfull of
                  jailhouse tatts.

QUICK FLASHES OF BOBBY'S TATTOOS.

                             TANNER
                  No last name?

                             DANNY
                  It was all pretty informal.  Didn't
                  have a lot of time to exchange
                  pleasantries.

Garcetti produces something from the front seat of the car and trudges 
over.

                             GARCETTI
                  This the guy?

                             DANNY
                  It speaks!

The humorless Garcetti hands Danny a "WANTED POSTER".  Bobby's mug shot 
glaring.

                             DANNY
                  That's him.  He's a lot prettier in
                  person though.

                             GARCETTI
                  Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.

                             DANNY
                  Dude is bugging.  Transparent
                  spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.

                             GARCETTI
                  What's he holding?

FLASHBACK - INT. CHEAP MOTEL ROOM - DAY 

Bobby's hand extracting the eightballs from a nylon bag full of meth.

                             DANNY (O.S.)
                  Couple of eightballs, maybe more.

QUICK SHOT of an open drawer.  A GUN can be glimpsed inside.



                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Cheap ass techno knockoff in the
                  drawer with extra mags.

ANOTHER QUICK GLIMPSE of the closet.  A shotgun butt visable 

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  12 gauge in the closet.

                             TANNER (O.S.)
                  Any company?

The WOMAN'S HAND protruding from underneath the mattress.

                             DANNY (O.S.)
                  Alas, the lovely Mrs. Bobby was
                  playing the bologna in a Posturpedic sandwich
                       (beat)
                  And there was a kid.

A SILHOUETTE visible through a crack in the BATHROOM DOOR.

                             TANNER (O.S.)
                  A kid?  Are you sure?

A BEAT-UP ELMO DOLL and SOME COLORING BOOKS on top of the dresser.

EXT. PARK - NIGHT

Back on Danny.
                             DANNY
                  Yeah. Pretty sure.
                       (beat)
                  Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too.

                             TANNER
                  God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.

                             DANNY
                  Somebody has to help you lazy bastards.

Garcetti looks at Danny with contempt.  They head back to the car.


                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Hey Tanner ... you be careful, okay?

                             TANNER
                  Danny, I'm touched.

                             DANNY
                  Don't be. I'm worried about the kid.

                             GARCETTI
                  Then why didn't you help the kid when
                  you were there?

                             DANNY
                  Hey, you want me to do all your work
                  for you, numbnuts?

Garcetti throws Danny up against the car.  Nose-to-nose.

                             GARCETTI
                  I'll tell you why you didn't help -
                  because you're a chickenshit tweaking
                  snitch.  You're a bottom feader,
                  Flynne.

                             DANNY
                  Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect.

Garcetti lets Danny go. Stomps off.

                             DANNY
                  You're welcome.

EXT. CHEAP MOTEL ROOM - DAY

A GAGGLE OF ONLOOKERS, including a NEWS CREW, watching from the parking 
lot.

BOBBY'S WOMAN screaming at the top of her lungs as she tries to get a 
Bobby's sheet-covered body.

A SWAT TEAM packing up nearby.  One of them suddenly does a graceful 
little Tai-Chi gesture.

A LITTLE GIRL clutches at the screaming woman's legs.

REVEAL DANNY, amongst the onlookers.  His expression gives nothing 
away.

A ribbon of blood snakes from Bobby's body, over the parking lot curb 
and runs into a storm drain.

As the blood SPLATTERS to the bottom, mixing with a pool of filthy 
water. THE SOUND IS UNNATURALLY LOUD.

INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL - GARDENA - NIGHT.

The place cries out "YOU HAVE FINALLY HIT THE ABSOLUTE BOTTOM!"

Danny exist the stairwell and approaches his door.

A WOMAN ONE DOOR DOWN FROM DANNY'S ROOM struggles with her groceries.  
When she goes to open the door, one of the  bags breaks, spilling its 
contents onto the floor.

Danny walks over.

                             DANNY
                       (approaching)
                  Let me help you with those.

She scoops up the groceries and hurries into her room.  Slamming the 
door behind her.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                       (loud through the door)
                  And to think Miss Manner was
                  living down the hall from me and I
                  didn't even know it!

There is a can on the floor.  Danny bends down to pick it up.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Hey, you left a can of ...

He looks at the can.

INSERT - CAN 

The label is in CHINESE.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  ... some Chinese looking shit out here.

No reaction.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  I'll just leave it by the door here.
                       (beat)
                  I'm going now!

After a moment, the door swings open.  Danny is holding the can out 
with a big smile on  his face.
                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  You really oughta be more careful.
                  This is not a good neighborhood.

The woman smiles.  A pretty smile.  Sad too.

                             WOMAN
                  I was rude. I'm sorry.  I'm kinda new around here.

                             DANNY
                  You did the right thing.
                       (handing the can over)
                  What is this stuff anyway?

                             WOMAN
                  Fermented soybean curd.

                             DANNY
                  Yummy.

She smiles again. World-weary.  Sweet. Those eyes.  Sad.  Sexy.  Sad 
and sexy.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  My name is Danny Flynne.
                       (off her silence)
                  And you are?

                             WOMAN
                  Colette Aragon. Thank you, Danny.

She closes the door abruptly.

INT. RESIDENTAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

The burning room from the opening scene.  Danny's dirty clothes on the 
bed.

He emerges from the shower, a towel wrapped around his waist.  There is 
a BIG STAR-SHAPED SCAR on Danny's shoulder.

He walks over to the closet, takes a METAL LOCKBOX from the top shelf 
and puts it on the bed.

Pulls a key from his pocket and unlocks the box. He sits there staring 
at the contents for a moment, then gingerly takes them out ...

... CLOTHES.  A white dress shirt, black slacks and wingtips.

INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Danny dresses in his clothes, combing his hair.  He goes back in the 
lock box and pulls something else out ...

... A TRUMPET CASE.  He walks over to the cheap vanity and sits down in 
front of the mirror and stars for a very long time.

                             DANNY
                  My name is Tom Van Allen
                       (beat)
                  I play the trumpet.

He slowly opens the trumpet case revealing a GLEAMING HORN inside.  
Runs his fingers along the length of it and up to ...

... A PHOTO OF A WOMAN taped to the inside of the lid.  A self-
conscious smile on her face like she's uncomfortable with having her 
picture taken.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                       (distant)
                  My name is Tom Van Allen. I play the trumpet.

He takes the trumpet from the case - A CHECK from a LIFE INSURANCE 
COMPANY and a DRIVER'S LICENSE with Danny's picture and the name TOM 
VAN ALLEN.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  My name is Tom Van Allen and I play the trumpet.

He starts to play.  "Saeta" again.

AN IMAGE appears on THE BLANK WALL BESIDE HIM.  MOVE OFF DANNY AND UP 
TO THE IMAGE.

IN THE IMAGE - A HUGE LAKE in the middle of the DESERT.  CONTINUE 
MOVING IN ON IMAGE AS WE CUT TO ...

EXT. SALTON SEA - SUNSET (FLASHBACK)

Danny and THE WOMAN FROM THE PHOTOGRAPH sitting on the shore.  Watching 
the sunset. She is his wife, LIZ.

Danny playing "SAETA" on his trumpet.

Danny and Liz are alone, except for the myriad birds, silhouetted by 
the falling sun.

A gust of wind rushes across the lake, blowing Liz's hair all around 
her face.

A dying fish on the waterline, gills pumping for oxygen.

Danny finishes playing.

Silence.

IMPORTANT: DANNY WILL BE KNOWN AS TOM IN THIS SCENE.

                             LIZ
                  That's so ...
                       (not finishing the word)

                             DANNY / TOM
                  Melancholy?

                             LIZ
                  Yes, it hurts my heart.  What a
                  beautiful composition.

                             DANNY/TOM
                  And the performance?






                             LIZ
                       (goofing)
                  A virtuoso rendition.  TOM VAN ALLEN
                  is nothing short of dazzling in his
                  interpretation of Miles Davis'
                  haunting, moody piece.

                             DANNY/TOM
                  Thank you.  Thank you very much.

                             LIZ
                  And he has a really hot ass with hardly
                  any hair on it.

                             DANNY/TOM
                  Again, I thank you.

                             LIZ
                  I was talking about Miles.

Danny playfully tackles her to the ground.

                             DANNY/TOM
                  You, madam, are a heartless wench.

                             LIZ
                  And you've got wiener breath.

                             DANNY/TOM
                  Really?

                             LIZ
                  It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch.

Danny starts kissing her over and over again.

                             LIZ
                       (laughing)
                  Tom! Gross!

She finally pushes him off.  He rolls off of her and snuggles up next 
to her, spooning her in the sand.

                             DANNY/TOM
                  You know how I make that song
                  melancholy when I play it?
                  I think of what my life would be like
                  without you.

Liz smiles, snuggles closer to Danny.

                             LIZ
                  Tom, let's spend the night here.

                             DANNY/TOM
                  There's no motels around here.

                             LIZ
                  No.  Right here on the beach.  Come
                  on. Let's do it.

INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Danny sitting at the vanity holding the trumpet.  THE IMAGE IS STILL 
PROJECTED ON THE WALL BEHIND HIM.
                             DANNY
                       (at the vanity, whispering)
                  Okay, we'll stay.  We'll stay.

NOW THE DANNY IN THE IMAGE ANSWERS ....

                             DANNY/TOM
                       (on the beach)
                  Come on, Liz. We'll get eaten alive.

                             DANNY
                       (at the vanity, softly)
                  No ... We'll stay.

BACK ON THE IMAGE as Danny and Liz walk away from the shore.

The sun sinks completely below the horizon.

A long fish hawk floats on the last of the thermals.

The dying fish breaths its last.

Danny (at the vanity) closes his eyes.

SERIES OF QUICK CUTS

The trumpet goes back in the case.

The lid is closed.

The case goes back in the box.

The neatly folded clothes are laid on top.

The box goes back to the shelf.

The light in the closet is turned off.

                                                          FADE OUT.

                                                          FADE IN.

EXT. DESERTED PARK - NIGHT

Danny and Tanner sitting across from one another at a picnic table.

Tanner writing serial numbers down as he counts out SEVERAL HUNDRED 
DOLLAR BILLS.

Danny watching silently.

Tanner puts the bills in an envelope, licks the flap, seals it and 
slides it over to Danny, who doesn't touch it.

The envelope lays there between them for the following conversation.

                             DANNY
                  You think I'm a Judas?

                             TANNER
                  Hard to compare the people you're
                  taking down with the Lord.

                             DANNY
                  Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.

                             TANNER
                  Garcetti thinks everything is shit.
                  He doesn't even like dolphins.

Danny smiles.

                             TANNER (cont'd)
                  I'm serious.  He hates 'em.  You ever
                  hear of anyone who didn't like dolphins?

Tanner shakes his head and smiles.


                             DANNY
                  Thanks for not judging me.

                             TANNER
                  It's not my place.

                             DANNY
                  Don't you wonder why I do it?

                             TANNER
                  The money? The drugs? Keeping yourself
                  out of jail? I know the drill.


                             DANNY
                  You don't find that repugnant?

                             TANNER
                  Just the way the world works.  Look,
                  as far as tweakers go, you aren't a
                  bad guy.  You never hurt anyone but
                  yourself as far as I know.

                             DANNY
                  Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid.

                             TANNER
                  Bobby laid his own tracks.  He could
                  have gone quietly but he played the
                  hard-ass con till the end. And as
                  far as I'm concerned, he wife and
                  kid are a hell of a lot better off
                  without him.
                       (beat)
                  Now take the money.

Danny stuffs the money into his jacket.

                             TANNER (cont'd)
                  One think I do want to know is how
                  the hell did you get yourself into
                  this position to start with?  You
                  seem like a smart enough guy.

                             DANNY
                  It's a long story.  Maybe I'll tell
                  you all about it some day.

Garcetti emerges from the men's room, zipping up.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Hey, Garcetti ... You ever get
                  confused and try to flush yourself?

                             Garcetti
                       (all business)
                  You tell him?

                             TANNER
                  I was getting to it.

                             DANNY
                       (to Tanner)
                  Tell me what?

                             GARCETTI
                  I'll tell him.


                             DANNY
                       (worried)
                  Tell me what?

Garcetti sits down next to Danny. Sighs.

                             GARCETTI
                       (mock concern)
                  Danny, it's really pains me to have to
                  tell you this, but do you remember
                  DOMINGO, that wetback you helped us
                  put away for trafficking a few months back?

                             DANNY
                  Yeah.  What about him?

                             GARCETTI
                  Turns out he's connected.

                             DANNY
                  To who?

                             GARCETTI
                  The Mexicali Boys

                             DANNY
                  And what does this have to do with me?

Garcetti puts his hand on Danny's shoulder, really playing it up.

                             GARCETTI
                  He knows somebody ratted him.

                             DANNY
                  What?!

                             GARCETTI
                  And he's making a lot of noise about
                  having his homies hang a Colombian
                  necktie on whoever it was.

Garcetti leans in close

                             GARCETTI (cont'd)
                  You know that thing where they slit
                  your throat and pull your tongue out
                  of the hole.

Danny knocks Garcetti's hand away and stands up.  Garcetti stalks him.




                             GARCETTI (cont'd)
                  Apparently they call it a necktie
                  because it hangs down about yay long
                  and looks very similar to a tie.
                  Isn't that weird, Danny?  Isn't that
                  weird?

                             DANNY
                  Shut up, Garcetti!

Danny turns to Tanner

                             DANNY
                  If he finds out it's me, I'm a dead man.

                             TANNER
                  Danny, he isn't gonna find out it's
                  you.  Domingo was a slinger, he must
                  have sold to hundreds of different people.

Danny paces back and forth.

                             TANNER (cont'd)
                  And if you're that worried about it,
                  maybe you ought to get out of town.

                             DANNY
                  How the hell am I gonna do that?  You
                  guys are still stringing me a long on
                  that possession charge.


                             GARCETTI
                       (mock surprise)
                  You mean that hasn't been cleared up yet?

Garcetti chuckles at Danny's fear

                             DANNY
                  Fuck you, Garcetti. I been at this
                  for almost a year. I've done
                  everything you guys have asked of me.

                             GARCETTI
                  Anyone ever ask you to be such a
                  disrespectful smart-ass all the time?

                             TANNER
                  Look, we'll talk to the A.D.A.

                             DANNY
                  When?

                             TANNER
                  Soon. I promise.  We'll get the
                  charges dropped and you can
                  disappear.  In the mean time, trust
                  me, he has no idea that you ratted him out.

EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

Danny sitting cross-legged in front of a gravestone.

A PICKUP TRUCK slowly winds its way up the access road towards Danny.

Danny stands up.  Dusts his pants off.

The truck stops nearby.  The strains of GARTH BROOKS from inside.

Danny approaches.  The passenger's side window rolls down revealing ...

... A BAD-ASSED ASIAN DUDE behind the wheel. He wears a cowboy hat and 
a rodeo belt.  He looks like the Chinese Marlboro man.  This is BUBBA.

An AIRBRUSH painting on the door panel - a bad likeness of Bubba 
astride a horse, dressed as a cowboy with a huge-breasted Pamela 
Anderson-type on the saddle behind him.

                             DANNY
                       (checking out the painting)
                  Ride 'em cowboy)

                             BUBBA
                       (southern twang)
                  You like that?

                             DANNY
                  Who wouldn't?

                             BUBBA
                  First rate, ain't it?

                             DANNY
                  It's downright classy is what it is.

Bubba fires up a cigarette, revealing a pock-marked face. He carries a 
gun in a tooled leather shoulder holster.
                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  You consider my presentation?

                             BUBBA
                  Get in, hoss.  We'll talk it over.

Danny climbs in.  The window goes back up.  As the care pulls away, we 
...

... MOVE back over to the gravestone.

The stone reads: "ELIZABETH VAN ALLEN.  BELOVED WIFE"

EXT. THE CINDER BLOCK BAR - NIGHT

A non-descript. cinder block bar.  No windows.  No frills.

INT. CINDER BLOCK BAR - SAME

Danny sitting at the bar, nursing a drink.  He looks nervous, eyes 
darting around for potential assassins.

He has nothing to worry about with this crowd, harmless alcoholics all.

Jimmy The Finn enters and approaches Danny.  Danny signals for Jimmy to 
go to the back, then gets up and follows him, carrying two beers.

                             DANNY
                  Jimmy, you don't look so hot.

Jimmy has dark circles under his eyes.

                             JIMMY
                  I'm hurting.

                             DANNY
                  You on a roll?

                             JIMMY
                  Was.  I'm on the fucking ghost train
                  right now, man.  You got anything for
                  me?

                             DANNY
                  Sorry.

                             JIMMY
                  Why does it have to feel so bad?

                             DANNY
                  You're brain is in reverse mode ...
                  cutting off your supply of dopamine.
                  Here.  Have a beer.

Jimmy sighs, scratches his arms.  They are all scabbed up.


                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  You see the crank bugs?





                             JIMMY
                  Oh yeah.
                       (guzzles some beer)
                  Man, Danny, how do you keep your shit
                  together so tight?

Danny chuckles.
                             DANNY
                  That's a good one.

                             JIMMY
                  I'm serious, dude.  You always seem
                  to be on top of things, even when
                  you're tweakin'.

                             DANNY
                  I guess there's just no substitute
                  for good genes.

Jimmy finishes his beer.  Danny signals to the cocktail waitress for 
more beer.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  You hear about Bobby?

                             JIMMY
                  Yeah, it's a pity.  Truly a pity.

Danny smiles at Jimmy's choice of words.

                             JIMMY (cont'd)
                  He was a good supplier.
                       (gets an idea)
                  You think maybe there's any drugs
                  left in his room?  You know, like
                  hidden?

                             DANNY
                  I kind of doubt it, Jimmy.

The beers arrive.  Jimmy lays into his, downing it in one long gulp.  
Danny slides his over.


                             JIMMY
                  So, why'd you want to see me?

                             DANNY
                  Business.  I need to leave town and I
                  find myself in dire need of some cash.

                             JIMMY
                  See that?  That's just what I'm talking about.


                             DANNY
                  What?

                             JIMMY
                  You. You're smooth. You use words like dire
                  and shit.  You got language skills, man.

                             DANNY
                  Don't get carried away.

                             JIMMY
                  I find myself in dire need of some cash.

Jimmy shakes his head in wonder.

                             DANNY
                  You remember that guy you told me
                  about ... said he could handle a big
                  hook-up?

                             JIMMY
                  Yeah, Pooh-Bear.  Dude is a big-time
                  cook. I'm talking dire.

                             DANNY
                  I know a buyer.  Guy's looking for a
                  quarter's worth.

Jimmy frowns.

                             JIMMY
                  A quarter?  Danny that ain't even worth ...

                             DANNY
                  A quarter of a million, Jimmy.

Jimmy's a drug-addled eyes catch a glimmer.

                             JIMMY
                  Fuuuuuck

                             DANNY
                  Can your man handle that?

                             JIMMY
                  I think so.  I mean, we'd have to
                  talk to him.

                             DANNY
                  Can you set that up?

                             JIMMY
                  Sure.

Jimmy sucks what's left of his beer down.

                             JIMMY (cont'd)
                  What's in it for us?

                             DANNY
                  I'm getting a 10% finder's fee from
                  my man if I can get the right price.

                             JIMMY
                  10%.  That's ...

Jimmy becomes paralyzed by the math.

                             DANNY
                  25 grand.  You introduce me to your
                  boy, I'll cut you five grand out of
                  my take.  That's all you gotta do,
                  just get me in the door.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Danny walking home.  Sparse traffic on the street. He walks with his 
head down and his hands thrust in his pockets.

A RED CAR approaches from the opposite direction. It SLOWS as it passes 
Danny.

Danny looks over.

The DRIVER is obscured by the reflected glare of a streetlight, but it 
is obvious that he is staring right at Danny.

Danny plays it cool. Keeps walking.

The red car pulls a SLOW U-TURN.

Danny hauls ass.

The red car catching up.

7Danny runs down a service street which runs through the back of a 
series of apartment complexes.

The red car follows, slowly prowling the street.

Danny squeezed behind a dumpster, watching.

It is now too dark to see the driver.  The car comes to a stop.

Danny hugging the dumpster tight.

Another car pulls into the tight street, behind the red car.  The 
driver of the other car SOUNDS HIS HORN.  The red car speeds off.

Danny walks quickly the other way.

INT. BARE APARTMENT - NIGHT

A WAY-TOO-YOUNG BLACK KID stares DIRECTLY AT CAMERA, an ARRAY OF 
HANDGUNS, KNIVES, RIFLES AND SECURITY EQUIPMENT spread out on the 
dining room table before him.

He is squeezed into a terry-cloth jumpsuit, his body festooned with 
gold jewelry, his hair all wet jerry-curl.

He looks like Barry White, Jr.
                             KID
                  Mister, I only deal in high-end
                  weapons.  All guaranteed stolen and

                  owners.  All sales are final and all
                  prices are negotiable.

The kid speaks in a HUSKY MONOTONE, completely FLAT and HUMORLESS.  He 
sounds like one of those kids selling candy door-to-door with a 
memorized pitch told by rote.

                             KID (cont'd)
                       (rapid fire delivery)

                       (next gun, no pause)
                  Tangfolio semi-automatic.  This a 9mm

                  surprising 16 round magazine.
                  Mister, I want to sell you this gun
                  and I can hook you up for the low
                  price of 200 dollars.

                  Maybe you looking for something in

                  Mister, I won't lie to you, this gun

                             KID (cont'd)
                  but it ain't all that.  That's why
                  you can walk out of here with this
                  gun for the incredible low price of
                  one hundred and "fitty" dollar.
                       (next one)
                  Maybe you looking for power, mister.
                  This gun got mad power, mad kick and
                  mad reputation.  That's right, it's
                  the Colt .357 Magnum revolver.
                  Rubber combat-style grip, fixed rear,

                  ounces.  6 shot capacity with double
                  action. Mister, if you're looking
                  for impact, the Magnum will satisfy
                  all of your needs.
                       (the last gun)
                  I don't know you, mister, but you
                  look like a man of style so maybe you
                  in the market for a custom piece.
                  Mister, it's your lucky day 'cause
                  this gun got style to burn.  You

                  12 shot capacity magazine.  I could see
                  you with this gun, mister.  And I can
                  give it to you for the low price of
                  seven hundred and ninety-five
                  dollars.  Mister, these are my guns.
                  All sales are final, and all prices
                  are negotiable.

He finishes .... staring at ...

Danny and Jimmy, standing there, wide-eyed and amazed by the incredible 
sales pitch.

EXT. BAD NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

Rows of decaying stucco apartment buildings.  Danny and Jimmy walking 
away from one of the structures.

Danny pockets the GLOCK he just purchased.  He also carries a BULLET-
PROOF VEST over this shoulder.

                             DANNY
                  Jimmy, where do you find these people?

                             JIMMY
                  The Del Ammo Mall mostly.

They walk along.

                             JIMMY
                  You wanna score some go-fast?

                             DANNY
                  Not tonight.

They continue on. Jimmy looks at the vest.

                             JIMMY
                  Hey, why do you need a gun and a vest anyway?

                             DANNY
                  Personal protection. It's a
                  dangerous world we live in, Jimmy, a
                  very dangerous world.

INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL - NIGHT

A TRASHY LOOKING DUDE banging on Colette's door.

Danny at his door, fumbling with his keys, watching the dude.

                             DUDE
                       (sees Danny eyeballing him)
                  You mad dogging me, Bitch?

                             DANNY
                  Heavens no. I was just admiring your boots.

The dude looks down at this beat-up motorcycle boots.

                             DANNY
                  Did you purchase them locally?

The dude ignores Danny and keeps pounding on the door.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Goodbye now. Nice meeting you.

INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Danny enters.  AN ARGUMENT ENSUES NEXT DOOR between the dude and 
Colette.

The sounds of a struggle.  Colette screams.  The dude yelling at the 
top of his lungs.  A LOUD SMACK. SILENCE.

Colette sobbing. The dude talking in hushed tones, contrite.

EXT. FREEWAY - DAY

A spray painted rusty Chevy Vega belching black smoke.  All of the 
lights are broken.

INT. VERA - SAME

Jimmy driving.  Danny in the passenger's seat, looking down at ...

... the floorboard, or lack thereof.  It is completely rusted out.  The 
freeway rushes by underneath.

                             DANNY
                  You know, Jimmy, you might as well
                  put a sign on the back of this thing
                  asking the cops to pull you over.

                             JIMMY
                  You mean, like to throw 'em off?

                             DANNY
                  Yeah, that's what I mean.
                       (beat)
                  Where the hell does this guy live anyway?

                             JIMMY
                  Palmdale

                             DANNY
                  Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?

                             JIMMY
                  I think on account of his nose.

                             DANNY
                  You're going to have to explain that
                  one.

                             JIMMY
                  He doesn't have one.

                             DANNY
                  You're going to have to give me a little
                  more than that, Jimmy.


                             JIMMY
                  Well, you know how Winnie the Pooh
                  always got his nose stuck in the honey jar?
                  Well, Pooh-Bear snorted so much
                  crank, they had to cut his nose off.
                  He's got a plastic one though.

Danny wonders what he's getting himself into.

                             JIMMY (cont'd)
                  You know, they say he hasn't slept in
                  over a year.

                             DANNY
                  You ever see Queen Elizabeth sleep?

                             JIMMY
                  No
                       (beat)
                  You think she's a tweaker?

EXT. POOH-BEAR'S COMPOUND - DAY

A sprawling old ranch house tucked into the remote hills of the desert.

A GUY passes out in the front yard.  A DOG sniffs at him, then starts 
pissing on him.  He never moves.

A PILE OF DEAD PIGEONS near the driveway.

CLOSE ON POOH-BEAR - he does indeed have a prosthetic nose.  It almost 
blends in with his face but not quite, making it that much more 
disconcerting.

He takes a huge hit of crystal meth from a pipe, holds it, then blows a 
long exhale.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Okay, here we go gentlemen ...

A REMOTE CONTROLLED CAR trundles out of the garage and along the 
driveway. Inside the car, FOUR PIEGEONS, their bodies wrapped in tape.

Pooh-Bear working the remote control device.

                             POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
                  Zapruder?

A GUY filming the whole thing with a super-8 camera.

GRAINY SUPER 8 FOOTAGE: the pigeons continue along, their stupid eyes 
glazed with confusion.


                             ZAPRUDER
                  Ready.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Oswald?

ANOTHER GUY sighting a scoped pellet gun.

                             OSWALD
                  Roger that.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Grassy knoll?

A THIRD GUY aiming a pellet gun further down and to the right of 
"Oswald".

                             GRASSY KNOLL
                  Ready

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Third shooter?

THE THIRD SHOOTER is also armed with a pellet gun


THIRD SHOOTER
It's a go.

Pooh-Bear watches anxiously.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  President Kennedy waving to the
                  crowd, his lovely wife looking
                  radiant beside him as they turn into
                  Dealey Plaza ...

GRAINY FOOTAGE: the car making a turn, the pigeons oblivious.

                             POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
                  Stand by, gentlemen.  Stand by ...
                       (beat, eyes widening)
                  Steady .... steady ... FIRE!

The three men open up simultaneously.

GRAINY FOOTAGE: a mass of feathers flying as the pigeons are hit.

Pooh-Bear pumps his fist.

                             POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
                  Yes!  Yes!
                       (beat)
                  Out! That's a wrap.  Good job, boys. Good job.

The car continues rolling past the feet of ...

... Danny and Jimmy, who have been watching the whole thing from the 
periphery

                             POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
                       (to Danny and Jimmy)
                  So? What do you think?

                             DANNY/JIMMY
                       (ad-libbing)
                  - Cool.
                  - Yeah. Interesting.

Pooh-Bear takes the camera from "Zapruder".

                             POOH-BEAR
                       (holding up the camera)
                  I'm gonna get this developed and send
                  it to the Warren Commission.

                             DANNY
                  Um, I think the Warren Commission has
                  been closed for a while.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  No shit?
                       (thinking)
                  Fuck it.  I'll send it to Oliver Stone then.
                  He'll get them to reopen the bastard.

                             OSWALD (O.S.)
                  Pooh-Bear! We got a problem.

Oswald is standing over the car, prodding one of the pigeons with his 
pellet gun.

                             OSWALD (cont'd)
                  J.F.K.'s still alive.
                       (beat)
                  Should I finish him off?

INT. POOH-BEARS HOUSE - DAY

Pooh-Bear and Danny alone in the kitchen.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  So, Danny, Jimmy tells me you have a
                  proposition for me.

Pooh-Bear picks at a plate of SCRAMBLED EGGS on his lap.



                             DANNY
                  Yeah, I uh, have a buyer who's
                  looking for about a quarter's worth.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Crank or glass?

                             DANNY
                  The good stuff.  Can you handle that?

Pooh-Bear chews his food and nods.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  I'm sorry.  Would you like a taste?

                             DANNY
                  No, I'm good.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  I insist. It's delicious. Just a taste.

Not wanting to offend him, Danny concedes.  Pooh-Bear shovels some eggs 
into Danny's mouth.
                             DANNY
                  Not bad.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Secret recipe.

Pooh-Bear winks and shovels some more down.

                             DANNY
                  Can we talk price?

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Make me an offer.

                             DANNY
                  I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?

                             POOH-BEAR
                  I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None
                  of that faggot metric crap for me.

                             DANNY
                  Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.

                             POOH-BEAR
                       (enthusiastic)
                  Hey, okay.

Danny looks surprised. It was too easy.

                             DANNY
                  You're serious?

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Anything for a dear friend.

                             DANNY
                  But I just met you.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  But you're a friend of Jimmy's. I
                  think of you as a brother already.

Pooh-Bear takes another bite of eggs.

                             DANNY
                  So that's 40 lbs. at 6 a pound then?

                             POOH-BEAR
                  If you say so.

                             DANNY
                  Pooh-Bear, I don't mean to be rude,
                  but I get the feeling you aren't
                  taking me seriously.

Pooh-Bear puts the plate down.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Maybe you're the one who isn't taking
                  me seriously.

                             DANNY
                  Why do you say that?

                             POOH-BEAR
                  I welcome you here with open arms and
                  you got the nerve to low-ball me like
                  some slick used car salesman.

                             DANNY
                  Hey, I was just trying to ...

                             POOH-BEAR
                       (never losing his smile)
                  I want to tell you about the last guy
                  who tried to jam me up on a deal.

                             DANNY
                  Hey, I don't play that.



                             POOH-BEAR
                  I'm sure you don't.  At least I'm
                  sure you think you don't.  Anyway, I
                  want to tell you. It's a good story,
                  guaranteed to break the ice at a party.

Pooh-Bear leans back, grinning broadly

                             POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
                  Dude shorted me eleven dollar ...
                  thought I wouldn't count it till I
                  got home.  Wrong.
                       (beat)
                  You know what I did?
                       (beat)
                  I clamped his head in a vice.

QUICK FLASH BACK: LOW ANGLE SLOW-MOTION CLOSE-UP of Pooh-Bear staring 
down at something OFFSCREEN, a menacing look on his face.

                             POOH-BEAR (V.O.)
                  You should have heard him howling.

BACK TO PRESENT: Pooh-Bear lights a cigarette

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Then I took a Saws All and I cut
                  His skull open

QUICK FLASH: CONTINUE SLOW MOTION CLOSE UP. Pooh-Bear reaching for 
something OFFSCREEN.
                             POOH-BEAR (V.O.)
                       (calmly)
                  You know, those Saws All really do
                  cut through everything.

BACK TO PRESENT: Danny getting nervous.

                             DANNY
                  Look, you don't have to ...

                             POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
                  So I'm standing there looking at this
                  dude's brain and I'm thinking to
                  myself, you know, this guy doesn't
                  really need this thing. I mean,
                  anyone stupid enough to jam me up
                  doesn't really use their brain to
                  begin with. You know what I'm
                  saying?
                       (beat, dead serious)
                  So I took it.

Pooh-Bear makes a POPPING SOUND as he illustrates with his hands.

QUICK FLASH BACK: Pooh-Bear looking down at SOMETHING in his hand, his 
face blossoming into a sick smile.

BACK TO PRESENT: Danny listens somberly.

                             POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
                  Hell, I make better use out of it
                  than he ever did.  Got it up in my
                  freezer. I take it out from time-to-
                  time, mix a little of it up in my
                  dinner ....
                       (looks at the plate of eggs)
                  ... of breakfast.

ON THE PLATE - little chunks of gray matter mixed in with the eggs.

Pooh-Bear smiles knowingly.  Danny turns pale.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  10,000 a pound

Danny decides to nerve it out

                             DANNY
                  Now you're insulting me.  Nice
                  talking business with you.

Danny gets up to leave. One of his hands shaking uncontrollably. He 
steadies it with the other hand.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  9,000.  Take it or leave it.

Danny stops.

                             DANNY
                  I'll leave it.  Eight is as high as
                  I'll go.  See ya'.

Danny goes to leave again.




                             POOH-BEAR
                  All right, all right. Don't get your
                  knickers in a knot. I can live with eight.

Pooh-Bear stands up.


                             POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
                  You got a deal.

They shake hands.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  God damn, Danny, you got some nerve.
                  Pooh-Bear respects that.
                       (beat)
                  Oh, by the way ...

Pooh-Bear takes something from the kitchen counter and tosses it on the 
table ...

... a store-bought package of COW BRAINS.

QUICK FLASH BACK: REVEAL that Pooh-Bear has been standing at the meat 
section in a GROCERY STORE. He is looking down at the package of COW 
BRAINS in his hand.

                             POOH-BEAR
                       (in the grocery store)
                  Hmm. Good price.

Pooh-Bear tosses the package in his cart and walks away, whistling.

BACK TO PRESENT:

                             POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
                  You want to stay for lunch?

Danny has been had.  Pooh-Bear laughs uproariously.

INT. VEGA - DAY

Danny slouched in the passenger's seat.

Jimmy holds out a bullet dispenser of crank.

                             JIMMY
                  You want a hit?

                             DANNY
                  No. I'm good.

Jimmy pockets the drugs.

                             JIMMY
                  Can I ask you something?

                             DANNY
                  Sure, Jimmy.

                             JIMMY
                  What does J.F.K. stand for?

                             DANNY
                  John Fitzgerald Kennedy.

                             JIMMY
                  Was he the president?

                             DANNY
                  Yes, Jimmy

Jimmy drives for a while, then ...

                             JIMMY
                  Danny?

                             DANNY
                  Yes, Jimmy.

                             JIMMY
                  Thanks for not laughing at me.

INT. CINDER BLOCK BAR - NIGHT

A DAPPER OLD MAN in a wheelchair crooning a Muzak-like version of Lou 
Reed's WALK ON THE WILD SIDE on a cheapo Karaoke set-up in the back of 
the bar.

                             OLD MAN
                       (softly, a la Perry Como)
                  Sugar Plum Fairy never once gave it away.
                  Everybody had to pay and pay ...

Danny, Jimmy, Kujo and Creeper sitting in a booth.

Jimmy and Creeper are amped, jaws grinding, eyes bugging.

Kujo rambles on but Danny isn't listening. He looks exhausted, his face 
is pinched, there are bags under his eyes.  He scans the bar, stopping 
on ...

... Colette AND HER TRASHY DUDE BOYFRIEND

Colette sees Danny looking.  Smiles at him.  Danny returns the smile 
until the trashy dude looks over.  Danny looks away.

                             KUJO
                  Danny, listen up.  Here's the deal ...
                  my wife's pimp knows a guy who works
                  at Cedars Sinai medical lab.  They're
                  getting a very special delivery a
                  week from this Friday.

                             JIMMY
                  What is it, drugs?

                             KUJO
                  Better than drugs.

Kujo leans in and lowers his voice

                             KUJO
                  Bob Hope's stool specimen
                       (beat)
                  We're gonna boost it.


                             DANNY
                  Why in God's name would we want
                  to do that?

                             KUJO
                  So we can sell it.

                             DANNY
                  To who?

                             KUJO
                  I don't know.  A collector.  Fuck
                  Danny, it's Bob Hope.

                             CREEPER
                  He is a national treasure.

Danny shakes his head in amazement, then looks back at Colette again.  
She sneaks another look at him.

ON THE TABLE - Kujo slides a drink glass in front of him.

                             KUJO
                  Check it out.  This is the lab.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY (FLASH FORWARD)

A stark hospital hallway. A placard on one of the doors - MEDICAL LAB.

A TITLE APPEARS - "KUJO'S BIG HEIST"

INT. CINDER BLOCK BAR - NIGHT

Creeper points at the glass.

                             CREEPER
                  What is that?

                             KUJO
                  It's the lab.


                             CREEPER
                  I mean what kind of drink?

                             KUJO
                  Cuba Libre

                             JIMMY
                  What is that? Rum and coke?

                             KUJO
                  Don't worry about it.

                             JIMMY
                  I just want to be straight on the
                  details.  Can I taste it?

                             KUJO
                  No, you can't taste it.  It's the fucking
                  lab! Now shut up.

Danny amused by the conversation.  He sees something out of the corner 
of his eye ...

The boyfriend kissing Colette roughly.  She obviously isn't enjoying 
it.

Danny watching intently.

                             KUJO (cont'd)
                  Danny, come on. If I'm gonna let you
                  in on the opportunity of a lifetime,
                  the least you can do is pay
                  attention.

Danny turns back to the table. Kujo slides another glass over.

                             KUJO (cont'd)
                  This is the courier

                             CREEPER
                  You should use something smaller.
                  He's the same size as the office. It
                  doesn't ring true.

Kujo rolls his eyes.  He uses a peanut instead.

                             OLD MAN (O.S.)
                  And the colored girls sing doot-de-doot ....

INT. HALLWAY - DAY (FLASH FORWARD)

A courier exits from the elevator carrying a medical sample case.



                             KUJO (O.S.)
                  He delivers at four o'clock on the
                  nose every Friday.  Alpha team will
                  be in the elevator with the courier.
                  That'll be Danny and Creeper.

MOVE INTO THE ELEVATOR - Creeper standing in the corner alone, asleep 
on his feet, drool trickling down his mouth.

                             KUJO (cont'd)
                  Every member of the team will be
                  equipped with night vision goggles, a
                  police scanner and two-way radios.

The elevator door closes on the dosing Creeper.

INT. CINDER BLOCK BAR - NIGHT

He slides over two peanuts behind the courier peanut.

                             KUJO (cont'd)
                  ... number two team, which will be
                  me and Jimmy, will be positioned in
                  the stairwell at the other end of the hall.

Kujo slides over two more peanuts.

The trashy dude heads into the bathroom.  Danny sneaks another look at 
Colette.  This time, she gives him a big smile.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY (FLASH FORWARD)

Kujo emerges from the stairwell, also alone, approaching the courier.

He is wearing shorts, a tank top and after-ski boots.  He has a big 
powdery crank donut around his nostrils.
                             KUJO (cont'd)
                  With alpha team following from the
                  elevator, number two team will
                  approach from the stairwell, cutting
                  the courier off before he reaches the lab.

Creeper still fast asleep inside the elevator.   He wakes with a start, 
breaking down into a karate stance.

INT. CINDER BLOCK BAR - NIGHT

The courier peanut is now surrounded by the other peanuts and the 
cashew.

                             KUJO (cont'd)
                  Facing superior numbers and an array of high-tech weapons, 
                  the courier will have no choice but to comply with our demands.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY (FLASH FORWARD)

Kujo and the courier playing tug-of-war with the case.  Kujo points a 
dustbuster vacuum at the courier like it was a gun.

INT. CINDER BLOCK BAR - NIGHT

Jimmy listening intently, takes some of the peanuts.

                             KUJO
                  Jesus Jimmy, you at the alpha team.

                             JIMMY
                  I thought you were done.

Jimmy pulls peanut paste from his mouth and mounds them up on the 
table.

                             OLD MAN
                  I said hey sugar, take a walk on the wild side ...

                             KUJO (cont'd)
                  Now here's the beautiful part.  The
                  getaway.  Both teams will rappel
                  right down the center of the
                  stairwell, change clothes and walk
                  right out the front door like nothing
                  happened.

INT. HOSPITAL - DAY (FLASH FORWARD)

Kujo tumbling head-over-heals down the metal steps.  He gets to his 
feet, a bloody mess.

The kit has sprung open, sending shit samples everywhere.

Kujo quickly scrapes as much as he can back into a container and runs 
off.

EXT. CEDARS SINAI - DAY (FLASH FORWARD)

Kujo bolts out the front door, into the street and directly into the 
path of ...

... an ONCOMING AMBULANCE, which drags him underneath for a good fifty 
feet.

INT. CINDER BLOCK BAR - NIGHT

Danny watches as the trashy dude exits the bathroom.

                             KUJO
                  So what's it gonna be, Danny boy?
                  You in or out?

Trashy dude goes to Colette.  It looks like he wants to leave and she 
doesn't.


                             KUJO (cont'd)
                  Danny!

Trashy dude grabs her by the back of the neck, lifts her off the stool 
and pushes her out the front door.

                             DANNY
                       (watching Colette)
                  I'm afraid I'm gonna have to pass on
                  this one, boys.

Danny watches her exit.

INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL - NIGHT (LATER)

Danny approaches his door. Stops. 

Colette is sitting in the hall, head in hands, sobbing. 

Danny starts to say something. Stops. Goes to this door. Stops again. 

                             DANNY
                  You okay?
                  She nods. 

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Well...good night then.

Danny starts to enter again. Stops again. 

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Why are you out here?

                             COLETTE
                  Quincey, my boyfriend... he kicked me out.

Danny isn't quite sure what to do. He takes a half-step towards her. 

                             DANNY
                  Look...I'd like to help you out ... but I
                  really don't want to get involved.

                             COLETTE
                  I understand. Thanks anyway.

She looks up. That face. Those eyes. Everything about her says "Get 
involved."

INT. COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT

Danny and Colette in a near-deserted retro coffee shop.

A LONE WAITRESS AND COOK mull behind the counter.

Colette's mascara is running.  Danny hands her a napkin.

                             COLETTE
                  Thanks.

She dabs at her eyes.

                             COLETTE (cont'd)
                  I'm so embarrassed.

                             DANNY
                  Don't be.

She looks at herself in a compact mirror.

                             COLETTE
                  Jesus, I look like a raccoon.

                             DANNY
                  I was thinking Alice Cooper.

She puts her head in her hands.  Sighs.

                             COLETTE
                  Oh God.

                             DANNY
                  Come on, cheer up. It could be worse.

She looks up.

                             COLETTE
                  How?

                             DANNY
                  I don't know .... you could be staking
                  your financial future on stealing Bob
                  Hope's stool specimen.

She laughs

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  See. No matter how bad things are,
                  there's always someone a little worse off.

                             COLETTE
                  What about the guy on the very bottom?

                             DANNY
                  Leave me out of this.

                             COLETTE
                  That bad, huh?

Danny holds up his water glass.

                             DANNY
                  Nevertheless, I still try to see
                  the glass as half-full.

He takes a sip.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Problem is, it's usually half-full of
                  something that tastes a  lot like urine.

He pulls a face.  Sets the glass down.

                             COLETTE
                  Could be worse.
                       (beat)
                  Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to.

                             DANNY
                  Ouch.

Colette sips her coffee.   Danny looks around nervously.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Hey, did I mention that I was a coward?

Colette frowns, not sure what he means.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Quincey. You sure he isn't gonna
                  come looking for you?

                             COLETTE
                  Don't worry, he's probably passed out
                  with his head in the toilet by now.

                             DANNY
                  This man sounds like a real catch.

                             COLETTE
                  Oh, he's a keeper all right.

                             DANNY
                  Colette ...

He stops.
                             COLETTE
                  What?

                             DANNY
                  Nothing.

                             COLETTE
                  Go ahead.

                             DANNY
                  Look, it's really none of my business
                  but why don't you just dump this guy?

                             COLETTE
                  It's not that easy.

                             DANNY
                  Don't tell me, down deep he's really
                  not a bad person and you don't want
                  to see him get hurt.

                             COLETTE
                  Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce
                  Brothers?
                       (beat)
                  I hate the son-of-a-bitch.

                             DANNY
                  Then leave.

                             COLETTE
                  I can't.

                             DANNY
                  Why not?

                             COLETTE
                  You don't understand.

                             DANNY
                  There's nothing to understand.  
                  The guy is a pig.

                             COLETTE
                  I can't leave.

                             DANNY
                  You get off on abuse or
                  something?

                             COLETTE
                  Fuck you.

                             DANNY
                  Then why don't you leave?
                       (beat)
                  Just give me one good reason.

                             COLETTE
                  Because he'll kill me.

The waitress and cook look up.

                             COLETTE (cont'd)
                  Is that simple enough for you?

                             DANNY
                  Why don't you call the cops?

                             COLETTE
                  Why? They don't hold him for more
                  than a day or two.

                             DANNY
                  That's long enough to get out of town.

                             COLETTE
                  I can't. I've got a kid.  She lives
                  with my parents.  Quincey knows where
                  they live.

Danny chews it over for a second then ...

                             DANNY
                  Then make sure he gets put away for longer.

                             COLETTE
                  How?

Danny hesitates, not sure of how much he wants to get involved.

                             COLETTE (cont'd)
                  Tell me how.

                             DANNY
                  I don't know.
                       (beat)
                  Let me think about it.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Urban blight abounds

INT. BURNED OUT BUILDING - NIGHT

The grafitti-filled, cluttered shell of what used to be some sort of 
offices.

BUBBA THE ASIAN COWBOY sitting on a desk. Danny pacing back and forth 
in front of him.



                             BUBBA
                       (Texas drawl)
                  I wanna do a small buy first.  Ten
                  thousand.  We'll see how it goes.

                             DANNY
                  Why? The guys is ready to deal now.

                             BUBBA
                  Because I don't know him and I don't
                  really know you, partner.

                             DANNY
                  Now that's down-right insulting.

                             BUBBA
                  I'll have to live with that.  My money
                  my risk, my rules.

Bubba takes a plastic-wrapped bundle of money from his pocket.  Tosses 
it on the table.

EXT. ALLEY - SAME

Tanner and Garcetti ensconced in an alley diagonally across the street.

Garcetti pointing a LONG-RANGE PARABOLIC MICROPHONE at the burned out 
building.  He and Tanner wear earpieces, which are attached to the 
mike.

                             DANNY (O.S.)
                       (filtered, broken)
                  I guess I don't have a hell of a lot
                  of choice.

                             BUBBA (O.S.)
                       (filtered)
                  Get used to it.  You're in a very
                  tenuous position on the food chain, hoss.

Garcetti removes his earpiece and turns to Tanner.

                             GARCETTI
                  You thinking what I'm thinking?

                             TANNER
                  Yeah.  This could be the one we're
                  looking for.

EXT. BURNED OUT BUILDING - SAME

Bubba exits the building and disappears around the corner.

INT. BURNED OUT BUILDING - SAME

Danny now alone. He picks up the bundle of cash.  Turns to leave when 
...

... Tanner and Garcetti enter the building.  Danny turns and runs the 
other way.

                             TANNER
                  Hold it right there, Flynne.

Danny stops.

                             DANNY
                  Jesus, you almost gave me a heart attack!

Danny secretly pockets the bundle of cash.

                             DANNY
                  What the hell are you doing here?

                             TANNER
                  Question is, what are you doing here?

                             DANNY
                  I was trying to score some dope.

                             TANNER
                  Cut the shit, Flynne.

                             DANNY
                  Someone want to tell me what the hell
                  is going on here?

                             TANNER
                  Okay, asshole, you wanna play, we'll play.

Tanner takes out a pair of black leather gloves.

                             DANNY
                       (serious)
                  What did I do?!

Tanner approaches him.  Danny backs into a corner.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  This is a joke, right?  You put him
                  up to this, Garcetti?

Garcetti is mum.  Tanner raises his fists.  Danny covers his face.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Come on Tanner ... don't ...

Tanner starts swinging but SOMETHING UNEXPECTED ...

TANNER HITS LIKE A WIMP.

The punches have absolutely no effect.

Danny can't help it.  HE STARTS LAUGHING.  Tanner throws some more 
creampuffs.

Garcetti shakes his head with shame.

                             TANNER
                       (shrieking, failing)
                  You think this is funny motherfucker?

                             DANNY
                       (still laughing and covering up)
                  I can't help it, Tanner, you hit like
                  a fucking girl.

This makes Tanner even madder. His punches become wilder and even less 
effective.

                             DANNY
                  Garcetti, do something.

Garcetti tires of the whole show.  He pulls a small SHOCK GUN from his 
pocket, switches it on and sticks Danny behind the neck with it.

Danny crumples to the floor.  Tanner kicks him in the face.

Garecetti squats down next to Danny.

                             GARCETTI
                  We know what's going on.

                             DANNY
                       (in pain)
                  I still don't know what you're
                  talking about.

Garcetti jams the stun-gun into Danny's crotch.  DANNY HOWLS.  Garcetti 
lays off.  Danny lays there whimpering.

                             GARCETTI
                  Okay, let me help you.  You're setting
                  up a deal with a Chinese redneck.
                  Quarter of a million.

Garcetti holds up a tap.

                             GARCETTI (cont'd)
                  We just listened to the whole thing.

Danny gaped-mouthed. He can't believe it.

                             GARCETTI (cont'd)
                  Somebody tipped up, dipshit.

                             DANNY
                  Jimmy?

                             GARCETTI
                  Who the hell is Jimmy?

                             DANNY
                  He's the only one I told.

                             GARCETTI
                  And he probably only told two people
                  and they probably only told four
                  people and on and one. You know
                  better than to tell a secret to a
                  tweaker, Flynne.  Might just as well
                  broadcast it on the evening news.

INT. BURNED OUT BUILDING - NIGHT (LATER)

Danny sitting on a crate. He is sporting a BLACK EYE from where Tanner 
kicked him.

Garcetti at the desk dusting the plastic wrapper on the bundle of cash 
for prints.  Tanner paces back and forth in front of Danny.

                             DANNY
                  I met the guy at a party.  He said he
                  wanted to do a biggie. He's new in
                  town so I offered my services.

                             TANNER
                  This chink have a name?

                             DANNY
                  Bubba.

Tanner rolls his eyes.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  I swear. That's all he gave me.
                  Hell, I didn't give him my real name either
                       (off their skeptical looks)
                  He figured the less we know about
                  each other, the better.

                             TANNER
                  You better not be blowing smoke up
                  My ass, Flynne.

                             DANNY
                  After that ass-whipping you gave me?

Garcetti suppresses a smile.

                             GARCETTI
                       (finishing up with the bundle)
                  What's on the other end of this thing?

                             DANNY
                  Now that I can help you with. Nasty
                  boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear.
                  He's a chef.
                  Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure
                  they're keeping box scores on the guy.

                             GARCETTI
                  Sounds like you hooked up with some
                  fine citizens, Flynne.

                             DANNY
                  Oh they're all that and the
                  proverbial bag of chips.

                             TANNER
                  What're your taking down?

                             DANNY
                  Standard vig.  Minus five for a
                  certain blabber-mouth moron by the
                  name of Jimmy the Finn, who's living
                  proof that natural selection is a
                  flawed theory.

Tanner looks at Danny quizzically.

                             TANNER
                  Did you really think you were slick
                  enough to pull this off?

                             DANNY
                  Look man, I just wanted to make some
                  dough and disappear.  I didn't want
                  to wait around for Domingo to figure
                  out who doubled back on him.

Danny holds his hands up

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  But now I've seen the error of my
                  ways.  I'll just walk away ... call
                  the whole deal off.

                             GARCETTI
                  Wrong.

He tosses the bundle of cash to Danny.

                             DANNY
                  You mean you want me to roll on these guys?

Their silence is answer enough.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  No. No way.  These guys catch a
                  whiff and I'm a fucking bag of Bandini.

                             TANNER
                  You've got no choice.

                             DANNY
                  Whata you mean I've got no choice?

                             TANNER
                  Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in
                  la casa grande ...

                             DANNY
                  For that old possession charge?
                  Gimme a break.

                             TANNER
                  No. You just handed us a new one.  We
                  can go Federal on your ass right now:
                  ongoing criminal conspiracy. Intent
                  to buy and distribute $250,000 worth
                  of crank.  What's the mandatory on
                  that, Al?

                             GARCETTI
                  Dime, minimum.

MOVE OFF GARCETTI and over to a wall mounted heating vent.  MOVE INTO 
THE VENT, then ...

... OUT OF A VENT in another room.

BUBBA lurking in the shadows. Listening to the conversation through the 
wall vent in the other room.

                             TANNER (O.S.)
                  And believe me, word will get out that
                  you're a pro rat.

                             GARCETTI (O.S.)
                  That's not good in prison. It's just
                  not good.

Bubba listens intently.


INT. CAR - NIGHT

Danny hunkered down in the back sea.  Garcetti sniffing the air.

                             GARCETTI
                  What's that smell?

                             DANNY
                  That would be me.

                             GARCETTI
                  What'd you do, piss your pants?

                             DANNY
                  Hell, yes!  What the hell do you expect
                  zapping Mr. Johnson with that crackler?

Garcetti looks back at Danny with a twisted smile.

                             GARCETTI
                  Who'd have thought it?  Danny
                  "Chickenshit" Flynne trying to go
                  large right under our noses.

                             DANNY
                  Lay off, Garcetti.  I'm not in the mood.

                             GARCETTI
                  No.  You've got me all wrong.  I
                  mean, in you own pussified way, you
                  actually got some nuts in your little sack.

                             TANNER
                  Bullshit. He's a liar.

                             DANNY
                  News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.

                             TANNER
                  You think you're so god damned smart,
                  don't you?

The dynamic has suddenly changed in the trio's relationship.  Tanner is 
now the bad cop.

                             TANNER (cont'd)
                  Well, you played the wrong mark this
                  time, asshole.

EXT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL - NIGHT

Danny approaching the building, we hear shots ...

... THE RED CAR from earlier, prowling the streets.  Danny ducks into a 
liquor store and watches from the window.

The red car cruises slowly past.

Danny squinting, trying to make out ...

... THE LICENSE PLATE NUMBER.  A street light illuminates the tag 
momentarily.  A VANITY PLATE: IFORGIV.

Danny frowns, not sure that to make of it.

INT. COLETTE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Colette and Quincey lying in bed.  THE LILTING SOUND of Danny's trumpet 
wafting in the air.

Quincey is fast asleep.  Colette lays there, eyes open, listening to 
the coolly hypnotic strains of Miles Davis' "Generique."

INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - SAME

Danny in his good clothes, sitting in front of the mirror, playing his 
trumpet, staring at the photos of his wife.

INT. COLETTE'S ROOM - SAME

Colette now sitting on the floor of the adjoining wall with her arms 
around her knees.  She closes her eyes and leans her head against the 
wall, soaking in the music.

INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - SAME

Danny continues playing.  He sneaks down a look at ...

... A GREETING CARD on the vanity in front of him.  The word, 
"CONGRATULATIONS" printed on the front.

THE FLASHBACK IMGERY appears on the wall behind him again.  MOVE from 
Danny to the image as we ...

                                                      CUT TO:

EXT. DIRT ROAD - THE HIGH DESERT (FLASHBACK)

The car jolting slowly back and forth over the bumpy road.

INT. CAR - SAME

Danny driving. Liz in the passenger seat looking pissed.

The Salton Sea can be seen far below in the distance shimmering under a 
full moon.

AGAIN.  REMEMBER, DANNY IS KNOWN AS TOM IN THIS SCENE.

                             LIZ
                  Why didn't you just ask for
                  directions back there?

                             DANNY/TOM
                  Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?

                             LIZ
                  You mean like the Donner Party?

                             DANNY/TOM
                  Hey, do you think you could eat me if
                  you had to?  And if so, which part do
                  you think you would find the most
                  delicious?

                             LIZ
                  Tom, quit fucking around.

                             DANNY/TOM
                  Okay, okay.
                       (peering through the windshield)
                  There's a house up there. I'll go ask
                  for directions.

EXT. ROAD - SAME

A dilapidated house further up in the hills, lights glowing.

INT. CAR - SAME

Liz sees the run-down old house.

                             LIZ
                  You think that's a good idea?

                             DANNY/TOM
                  What do you mean?

                             LIZ
                  Look at that place. It's creepy.

Danny steers the car onto the narrow dirt approach to the house.

                             DANNY/TOM
                  First you want me to ask for
                  directions, then you don't.  Which is it?

                             LIZ
                  I wanted you to ask back there.  You
                  know, before you got us lost.

                             DANNY/TOM
                  Just no pleasing you, is there?

                             LIZ
                  Just admit you're wrong.

                             DANNY/TOM
                  We all know how much you like hearing
                  that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong.
                  There.  You happy?

                             LIZ
                  Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom.
                  It gets old.

                             DANNY/TOM
                  No. You know what gets old? Being
                  reminded what a loser you are every
                  time you screw up.

                             LIZ
                  Here it comes, poor Tom.

                             DANNY/TOM
                  But that's okay, Liz, you're the one
                  with the steady job, you pay all the
                  bills. I'm just an unemployed
                  musician.  You have every right.

                             LIZ
                  That is so unfair.

Danny stares straight ahead, steering the car towards the house.

                             DANNY/TOM
                  My sentiments exactly.

                             LIZ
                  Why are you doing this?

Danny doesn't answer.

                             LIZ (cont'd)
                  I never once asked you to stop
                  playing. I wouldn't dream of it. So
                  don't take your low self-esteem out
                  on me.

Danny continues to ignore her.

                             LIZ
                  ... Tom ... screw it.  Tell me when you're
                  ready to apologize.

INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

DANNY lying on the bed, reliving the moment.  THE IMAGE STILL PROJECTED 
ON THE WALL.
                             DANNY
                       (on the bed, whispering)
                  I'm sorry, Liz. I love you and I'm sorry.

But the DANNY IN THE IMAGE never answers.

INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - DAY

It is raining buckets outside.  Danny sleeping soundly.

The roof of Danny's room is leaking, PUDDLING UP ON THE FLOOR NEAR HIS 
BED.

Danny's eyes pop open. He lays there rigidly.  LISTENING TO THE WATER.

ALL OTHER SOUND FADES OUT AS THE WATER PATTERS AND PUDDLE ON THE FLOOR.  
IT IS UNNATURALLY LOUD.

INT. CINDER BLOCK BAR - NIGHT

The bar is almost empty.

Danny quietly playing chords on a beat-up old upright piano in the back 
of the room - the through-line of Davis' "All Blues." 

                             COLETTE (O.S.)
                  This seat taken?

Danny looks up. 

                             DANNY
                  Oh. Hi.

                             COLETTE
                  What happened to your eye?

                             DANNY
                  Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.
                       (beat)
                  By the way, I'm not looking for a
                  matching set.
                       (off her puzzled look)
                  Where's Quincey?

                             COLETTE
                  Don't worry. He's out of town.

                             DANNY
                  How far out of town?

                             COLETTE
                  Trust me. We're safe.

Colette sits down on the piano bench next to Danny. 

                             COLETTE (cont'd)
                  Please keep playing.

He continues. She sits there listening for a few moments. 

                             COLETTE (cont'd)
                  That's nice. What is it?

                             DANNY
                  Miles Davis. "All Blues."

                             COLETTE
                  Never heard of him.

                             DANNY
                  Just a fucked-up guy who played
                  beautiful music.

                             COLETTE
                  Like you?

                             DANNY
                  Nah. I'm strictly minor league...
                  except for the fucked-up part.

Danny continues to play. 

                             DANNY
                  Dude played his soul right out the
                  end of the horn. No false notes.
                  Always honest.

                             COLETTE
                  And you admire that?

                             DANNY
                  It's the only way to play.

Colette slides closer. 

                             COLETTE
                  Is that how you play?

                             DANNY
                  I try.


                             COLETTE
                  No false notes?

She pulls even closer. 

                             COLETTE
                  No deep dark secrets?

She goes to kiss him. Danny stops playing. Pulls away from her. 

                             DANNY
                       (cold and abrupt):
                  What are you up to?

                             COLETTE
                  Nothing.

                             DANNY
                  What do you want from me, Colette?

                             COLETTE
                  I don't want anything. Why are you
                  so suspicious?

                             DANNY
                  It gets me through the day.

                             COLETTE
                  You really need to lighten up.

She puts her hand on his leg. 

                             COLETTE (cont'd)
                  Just relax.

He moves his leg away. 

                             DANNY
                  Look, I can't help you with Quincey
                  if that's what you're after.

                             COLETTE
                  This has nothing to do with him.

                             DANNY
                  So you're just attracted to me, is that it?

                             COLETTE
                  Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?

                             DANNY
                  How much time do you have?

                             COLETTE
                  What is wrong with you?

                             DANNY
                  How much time do you have?


                             COLETTE
                  You've got a comeback for everything,
                  don't you, Danny? You use 'em like
                  some sort of shield.

                             DANNY
                  Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?

                             COLETTE
                  There you go again. You're nothing
                  but false notes.

                             DANNY
                  You don't like the tune, find another
                  station.

                             COLETTE
                  What are you hiding, Danny?

                             DANNY
                  Therapy session is over.

He closes the keyboard cover. 

                             COLETTE
                  You think you're the only one down
                  here with a sad story?

                             DANNY
                  No. But I'm the only one with my sad
                  story.
                       (beat)
                  And that's how it's gonna stay.

INT. CAR - DAY

Still raining.  Tanner negotiates the slow traffic.

Danny looking at a MUG SHOT OF POOH-BEAR.

                             Garcetti
                  Harlan Dale Monty a.k.a. Pooh-Bear.
                  Did five years manslaughter for
                  beating a pimp to death with an
                  electric wheelchair.

                             DANNY
                  Excuse me?

                             GARCETTI
                  Several possession charges, but nothing major.

                             DANNY
                  Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?

                             GARCETTI
                  They have. But they never found a lab.

                             TANNER
                  That's because he doesn't have one.

                             DANNY
                  Whata you mean?  He told me -

                             TANNER
                  Guy scores dope and dollar from
                  ripping off other drug dealers.  As
                  least that's what the word is.

                             DANNY
                  What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?

                             TANNER
                  That's probably what he would have
                  done if we hadn't found out about
                  your get-rich-quick scheme.

                             GARCETTI
                  You're lucky, Flynne.

                             DANNY
                  Funny, I don't feel lucky.

                             GARCETTI
                  We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D..
                  We'll have your sorry ass covered.

                             DANNY
                  What if he caps me before you can
                  make a move?

                             TANNER
                  Golly, I hadn't thought of that.

                             GARCETTI
                  Don't we always take good care of you?

Danny doesn't look reassured.

                             DANNY
                  Speaking of which ... you run that license
                  plate for me?

                             GARCETTI
                  You mean the menacing red car?

Garcetti and Tanner exchange a smile.

                             DANNY
                  What? Is it bad?

                             TANNER
                  I'm afraid so, Danny.

                             DANNY
                  Who is it?

                             GARCETTI
                  Brace yourself.

Danny's eyes dart back and forth between Garcetti and Tanner.

                             DANNY
                  Come on! Who is it?  Domingo's boys?

                             GARCETTI
                  Worse. Much worse.
                       (beat)
                  A teacher.

Garcetti and Tanner break out laughing.


                             TANNER
                  Car is registered to a Mrs. Nancy Plummer.

Danny reacts to the name, not listening to the rest of what Garcetti 
and Tanner have to say.

                             GARCETTI
                  She's 57 and she's been teaching
                  third grade for the last 33 years.

                             TANNER
                  Now that's scary!

Danny lost in thought.

                             GARCETTI
                  You're paranoid, Flynne.  I think
                  that crank is finally starting to get
                  the best of you.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Danny waiting on the corner.

                             GARCETTI (V.O.)
                  When is the deal going down?

                             DANNY (V.O.)
                  I'm making the small buy tonight ...
                  if I don't get beaten to death with a
                  wheelchair or something.  If
                  everyone is happy, we'll do the big
                  deal later in the week.

Jimmy's Vega sputters to a stop in front of Danny.  Jimmy gets out and 
hands Danny the keys.

ON THE BUMPTER, a hand-made sign. It reads: PULL ME OVER. I DARE YOU!

Danny sighs. Walks to the back, rips the sign off and gets in the car, 
leaving Jimmy with the sign.
                             JIMMY
                  You sure you don't want me to go with you?

Danny burns rubber.

EXT. POOH-BEAR'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

Danny being led towards a trailer by TWO OF POOH-BEAR'S MEN. LITTLE 
BILL AND BIG BILL. Little Bill is big and Big Bill is little.

INT. HOUSE - SAME

Pooh-Bear sitting in a recliner, obscured by shadows when Danny and his 
escorts enter.

A WIRE CAGE IN THE CORNER, SOMETHING MOVING AROUND INSIDE.  It too is 
obscured by shadows.

Pooh-Bear doesn't look up. He is preoccupied with something in his hand 
which he is cleaning with a toothbrush.

                             DANNY
                  Pooh-Bear, my man.  What's up?

Pooh-Bear doesn't respond. Continues brushing.

                             LITTLE BILL
                  He's blue.

                             BIG BILL
                  Comin' down from a 10 day ride.

Danny closes his eyes. Not what he wanted to hear.

                             DANNY
                  You want to do this some other time?

                             POOH-BEAR
                       (gloomy and tired)
                  Pull your pants down.

                             DANNY
                  I'm sorry?

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Pull your motherfucking pants down.

Danny looks to the two Bills for help.

                             DANNY
                       (laughing nervously)
                  Come on, guys ...

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Big Bill.

Big Bill pulls a 19th century double-barreled FLINTLOCK PISTOL from his 
jacket and points it at Danny's head.

                             BIG BILL
                  Argh, matie. I'm a pirate.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Little Bill

Little Bill drops Danny's trousers.  Danny about to object when he is 
started into silence.

The saturnine Pooh-Bear raises his head, illuminating his face.  He 
isn't wearing his prosthetic nose.  A GAPING HOLE WHERE HIS NOSE SHOULD 
BE.  He looks like some obscene human bat.

Pooh-Bear holds up the plastic nose he has been cleaning, inspecting it 
under the light.


                             POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
                  Introduce him to Captain Steubing.

He pops his nose back into place, but it goes on crooked.

The Bills escort Danny over to the cage.  There is A GIGANTIC CRAZED 
WEASEL INSIDE.

The cage is divided by a large piece of Plexiglas.

                             POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
                  You'll have to excuse him, he ain't
                  ate for over a week.

The weasel is foaming at the mouth.

                             POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
                  That and the rabies.  Don't make for
                  a happy weasel.

                             DANNY
                       (trying to stay calm)
                  Pooh-Bear. come on, man.  What is
                  this?
                       (off Pooh-Bear's silence)
                  It's me, Danny. I thought we had a deal.

                             POOH-BEAR
                             Big Bill
                  
                  Big Bill pushes Danny up to the cage, which comes up to about waist 
                  level.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Captain Steubing thinks you might
                  work for the police.

                             DANNY
                  What?!

Pooh-Bear holds up his hand.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Don't address me.  I didn't make the
                  accusation.

                             DANNY
                  Please .. I don't know what you're ...

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Uh-uh-uh ...

He points to the cage.   Danny looks down at the weasel, which is 
trying to gnaw through the Plexiglas.

                             DANNY
                  Jesus Christ.
                       (to the weasel)
                  Um ... I'm not .. Captain Steubing.
                  I'm not working for the cops.

The weasel continues to gnaw.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  He don't believe you. Big Bill.


                             BIG BILL
                  Drop your package in the cage.

                             DANNY
                  My what?

                             BIG BILL
                  Put your pee-pee through the hole.

There is a hole in the top of the cage on the opposite side of the 
Plexiglas from Captain Steubing.
                             DANNY
                  This is fucking crazy!

Big Bill pulls back the hammer on the gun.

                             BIG BILL
                  Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.

                             DANNY
                  Oh fuck ... oh Jesus ...

Danny's eyes dart quickly over to Little Bill, who like everyone else, 
is watching the weasel.

Little Bill is wearing a big, filthy pea coat with A LARGE TEAR on the 
side.

Danny still hasn't complied with Pooh-Bear's order.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Shoot him.

                             DANNY
                  Okay! Okay!

From behind, we see Danny bend slightly, dropping his privates into the 
cage.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                       (eyeing the wild rodent)
                  Oh my God ... oh-my-fucking-God ...

Danny tries to stay calm, shoots another look at Little Bill who is 
standing right next to him.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Now get talkin'

                             DANNY
                  I didn't fucking do anything! I
                  swear to God!

Pooh-Bear leans forward and opens the Plexiglas partition about half an 
inch.

THE WEASEL bolts for the opening, gnashing its teeth, trying to squirm 
through.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  You got something to tell Captain
                  Steubing, you'd better do it now.

The weasel squirms and squeals and bangs against the Plexiglas.

Danny uses the diversion.  He quickly TAKES SOMETHING from him own 
jacket pocket and SLIPS IT IN THE HOLE IN LITTLE BILL'S JACKET between 
the coat and the lining.

No one notices.

Pooh-Bear opens the Plexiglas even more.  The weasel is able to get his 
head through the hole.  He bares his filthy teeth.

                             DANNY
                       (rapid-fire)
                  Captain Steubing, listen to me.
                  You're after the wrong guy. This is
                  the fuck you should be talking to.

He nods towards Little Bill.  Pooh-Bear cocks his head.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Jimmy told me that Little Bill's been
                  shorting Pooh-Bear ... settin' up his
                  own stuff on the side.

                             LITTLE BILL
                  That's a pack of discharge.

Danny now makes eye contact with Pooh-Bear, who listens intently.

                             DANNY
                  It's true. Jimmy saw him flashing a
                  pimp role at a bar the other night ...
                  said he was dissin' your ass in front
                  of one of your customers.

Pooh-Bear rises slowly.  Approaches the triumvirate.

Danny keeps one eye on ...

... the weasel as it continues its assault on the opening.


                             POOH-BEAR
                  Man'll say a lot of thing when he's
                  sporting weasel food for a pecker.

                             LITTLE BILL
                  Damn straight.


                             POOH-BEAR
                  Least I can do is check it out though.

Pooh-Bear pulls a chrome .45 from his waistband.

                             DANNY
                  Can I pull my dick out now?

Pooh-Bear limply aims the .45 at Little Bill.

                             POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
                             Big Bill
                  
                  Big Bill pats Little Bill down.

                             LITTLE BILL
                       (holding up his arms)
                  Go ahead. I got nothing to hide.

Big Bill checks all of Little Bill's pockets, coming up empty.

The weasel has squeezed about a third of the way through the hole.

                             DANNY
                  Can I pull my dick out?

Danny, panicked, eyes the hole in the pea coat.

                             BIG BILL
                  He's clean.

Danny can't believe it.  But when Little Bill lowers his arms, a big 
roll of cash protrudes from the hole.

Pooh-Bear and Big Bill see it immediately.

                             LITTLE BILL
                  What?

He follows their gaze to the cash.

                             DANNY
                  CAN I PULL MY FUCKING DICK OUT?!

                             POOH-BEAR
                       (eyes on Little Bill)
                  Yeah.

Danny extracts himself from the cage just as ...

... the weasel bolts through the opening and springs for the hold in 
the cage.

INT. POOH-BEAR'S KITCHEN - NIGHT (LATER)

Danny sitting at the kitchen table.  THE SCREAMS OF LITTLE BILL AUDIBLE 
FROM THE OTHER ROOM.

Danny is FIDDLING WITH SOMETHING UNDER THE TABLE when he HEARS POOH-
BEAR APPROACHING.

Danny finishes up, stuffing a roll of DUCT TAPE into his pocket.

Pooh-Bear drops a zip-lock bag of METH on the table.

                             DANNY
                  I ought to just call this whole thing
                  off right now.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Don't do that. Please.  Or I'll kill
                  you.  Please, Danny.

                             DANNY
                  What the hell was that? Who told you
                  I was five-0?

                             POOH-BEAR
                  No one. It was just a test. I need
                  to be sure of who I'm dealing with
                  from time-to-time.

Pooh-Bear nudges the baggie towards Danny.


                             POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
                  Take it easy.  You passed.

Danny hands over the bundle of cash. Pockets the dope.

                             DANNY
                  Did it ever occur to you that someone
                  might cop to something they didn't do
                  rather than have their balls chewed
                  off by a rabid weasel?

                             POOH-BEAR
                  I'll keep that in mind.

MOVE UNDER THE TABLE - Danny's Glock taped to the underside, out of 
sight.

EXT. DESERTED PARK - NIGHT

Danny, Garcetti and Tanner.  Tanner doing a chemical test on the meth 
with a field kit.  The tester turns a tell-tale blue.


                             TANNER
                  We're in business.

                             GARCETTI
                  Good work, Flynne.  You're a first-rate rat.

                             DANNY
                  That's real sweet, Garcetti.  Thanks.

                             TANNER
                  We got the 411 on your good old boy.

Tanner produces a print out from an F.B.I criminal computer file.  A 
MUG SHOT OF BUBBA.  The name BUFORD "BUBBA" NGUYEN underneath.

                             TANNER (cont'd)
                  Nothing local so we ran his prints
                  through the F.B.I. Believed to be a
                  major supplier in Texas.  Jumped bail
                  on a murder rap last April.

                             DANNY
                  Murder.  Beautiful.

                             TANNER
                  Pumped fifty-seven bullets into a police informant.

Danny heaves a sign and plops down on a bench.

                             DANNY
                  You know, I'm starting to think I'd
                  rather take my chances with Domingo
                  than go through any more of this shit.

                             GARCETTI
                  Didn't you hear?  Domingo's dead.

Danny looks up.

                             TANNER
                  Took a pig-slicker to the heart.

                             DANNY
                  Jesus.

                             TANNER
                  I thought you'd be happy.

                             DANNY
                  Yeah.

He doesn't look happy.

INT. PRISON - NIGHT

Domingo sprawled face-down on the tile floor of the shower room.  Blood 
leaking from underneath him.

WATER PATTERS DOWN FROM THE SHOWER HEAD.  DILUTING THE POOL OF BLOOD.  
THE SOUND IS UNNATURALLY LOUD.

EXT. PALOS VERDES - NIGHT

The red car with "IFORGIV" plates parked in the driveway of a modest 
Spanish-style house.

INT. PALSO VERDES - NIGHT

NANCY AND VERNE PLUMMER watching TV.

Photos of Liz on top of a baby grand piano.  A SHRINE OF SORTS.

CATHOLIC ICONS ABOUND: crucifixes, Virgin Mary's, needle point prayers.

A KNOCK ON THE DOOR.  Nancy gets up to answer.

                             NANCY
                  Who is it?

                             DANNY (O.S.)
                  It's Tom.

Nancy and Verne look at one another.


INT. PALOS VERDES HOUSE - NIGHT

Danny and Verne sitting at the dining room table.  Nancy brings in a 
pot of coffee.  Verne eyes Danny silently.  Danny won't look him in the 
eye.

                             DANNY
                  All right, Nancy, how'd you track me down?

                             NANCY
                  Billy Sutcliffe said he saw you at a
                  bar down in Gardena a few weeks ago.
                  Said you looked so bad, he barely
                  recognized you.

Nancy pours the coffee.

                             NANCY (cont'd)
                  Billy's a cop now, you know.

                             VERNE
                  Highway Patrol.

                             NANCY
                  He said you were ... the people you 
                  Were with ... well ...

                             VERNE
                  Said you were a drug addict.

                             DANNY
                  Maybe I should just go.

Danny pushes away from the table.  Nancy grabs Danny's wrist.

                             NANCY
                  No. We want to help you, Tom.

Danny stays put.

                             NANCY (cont'd)
                  I know everyone deals with grief in
                  their own way.  I know how hard it is
                  to find closure.

                             DANNY
                  Closure? How do you find closure
                  when her killers are still running
                  around out there?

                             NANCY
                  I found forgiveness in my heart for
                  the people who killed my daughter. I
                  gave my grief to Jesus Christ.

                             DANNY
                  Is that what you want me to do?  Put
                  it all on Jesus?  Let him sort it out
                  in the afterlife?

                             NANCY
                  You've got to deal with this sooner
                  or later, Tom. You can't keep
                  hiding.

                             DANNY
                  Maybe I am dealing with it.

                             NANCY
                  I know it's not my place to pass
                  judgement on you but ...

Danny looks at the shrine to Liz on top of the piano.



                             DANNY
                  Then why don't I see any pictures
                  Of me up there?

                             VERNE
                  That was my idea.

                             DANNY
                  You never did like me much, did you
                  Verne?
                       (beat)
                  And you can't stand it that I walked
                  out of there alive and Liz didn't.
                  You think I'm a coward,
                  don't you?

Verne's silence is answer enough.



                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  I don't blame you for hating me.  At
                  least I understand that.
                       (back to Nancy)
                  But forgiving the butchers who killed
                  Liz well I'm having some trouble
                  with that one.

                             NANCY
                  Love your enemies, bless them that
                  curse you, do good to them that hate
                  you, and pray for them which
                  despitefully use you, a persecute
                  you.

Danny touches Nancy's hand tenderly.

                             DANNY
                  I'm genuinely happy that you found
                  some peace, Nancy. But you can't
                  forgive for Liz.  No one can.  And
                  you can't forgive for me.

                             NANCY
                  Your hatred makes them stronger and
                  you weaker.

                             DANNY
                  I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred.
                       (beat)
                  Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night 
                  she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a
                  chance to apologize to her.  Do you know what that feels like?

                             NANCY
                  It's not too late to show her you're sorry.

                             DANNY
                  How?

Verne slams his hand down on the table.

                             VERNE
                  By not disgracing her memory!

                             DANNY
                  What does that mean?

                             VERNE
                  You might as well be spitting on her
                  grave every time you put drugs up
                  your nose.  Or did you just
                  conveniently forget that it was drug
                  dealers who killed my daughter?

Verne glares at Danny.  No forgiveness in his heart.

                             VERNE (cont'd)
                  You ever think you might be buying
                  drugs from the very people who took
                  her life?

                             DANNY
                  You don't understand.

                             VERNE
                  Understand what?

Danny starts to say something.  Stops.

                             DANNY
                  Nothing. It's ... it's complicated. I
                  just want you to know ... I'm not what
                  you think I am.

INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Danny sitting at a table, the lockbox open in front of him.

He is endorsing the back of a life insurance check.  His Tom Van Allen 
driver's license laying next to it.

A KNOCK AT THE DOOR



                             DANNY
                  Who is it?

                             COLETTE (O.S.)
                  It's me.

                             DANNY
                  I'm kind of busy.

                             COLETTE (O.S.)
                  Please open the door, Danny.

He pockets the check and the license, closes the lockbox and goes over 
to the door.

Colette standing on the other side.  Her FACE AND ARMS ARE BLACK AND 
BLUE WITH BRUISES.
                             DANNY
                  Oh Jesus.

He lets her come in.  Colette looks away.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Colette ... You've gotta leave.

                             COLETTE
                  We been through that.

                             DANNY
                  What about a battered woman's
                  shelter? You can move you kid in
                  with you.

                             COLETTE
                  I need my paycheck.

                             DANNY
                  You can still work.

                             COLETTE
                  He knows where I work.

                             DANNY
                  Find a new job.


                             COLETTE
                  It's not that easy. I just got a
                  raise. I need the money.

                             DANNY
                  You always been this stubborn?

Colette cracks a crooked smile.

                             COLETTE
                  From day one.
                       (beat)
                  I was a breach birth. They tried for
                  hours to turn my little butt around.
                  But I wouldn't let 'em.

                             DANNY
                  Ass first into the world.

                             COLETTE
                  I been that way ever since.

Danny smiles.  He gently touches her eye.  Colette reaches up and 
touches Danny's bruised eye.
                             COLETTE (cont'd)
                  Look at us.  What a pair.

Colette leans in to kiss him, but they bump bad eyes.

                             COLETTE/DANNY
                  Ouch.
                  They laugh.

                             COLETTE
                  Can we try that again?

They kiss again.  Deep and long.  Danny suddenly pulls back mid-kiss.

                             DANNY
                  I can't.

Colette goes to touch him. He pulls away.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  I can't.

                             COLETTE
                  Why not?

                             DANNY
                  I just can't. Okay?

Danny paces uncomfortably.

                             COLETTE
                  What's wrong, Danny?

                             DANNY
                  Look, maybe you oughta' leave.


                             COLETTE
                  No. I want to know what the hell
                  is going on.

                             DANNY
                  I can't tell you.

Colette comes to a slow realization.

                             COLETTE
                  There's someone else, isn't there?

THE FLASHBACK IMAGERY suddenly FLICKERS TO LIFE on the wall behind 
Danny - THE MOONLIGH SALTON SEA.

Danny freezes.  Looks up at Colette.
                             DANNY
                  Yes.

Colette waits a beat, then turns to leave.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Don't go.
                       (beat)
                  Please, Colette.
                       (she stops)
                  Stay and talk to me, please.

Something about Danny's voice - a raw vulnerability - which we haven't 
seen in him before.  MOVE OFF of Danny and ONTO THE FLASHBACK IMAGE.

                             DANNY (O.S.)
                  I'm so tired of lying.
                                                      CUT TO:


EXT. CREPPY HOUSE - SALTON SEA - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Danny's car parked out front.

INT. CREEPY HOUSE - SALTON SEA - NIGHT

A CHUBBY GUY sitting on the couch in his underwear, watching A MEXICAN 
WESTERN.  He sits there with wide eyes, GRINDING HIS JAWS.

Danny, Liz AND BO, the affable owner of the house, looking at a map on 
the kitchen table.

                             BO
                  What you want to do is go back the
                  way you came and make a left at the
                  bottom. It'll take you right to the
                  highway.

                             DANNY/TOM
                  That's it?

                             BO
                  Are you Australian?

                             DANNY/TOM
                  No.

                             BO
                  Good. I fucking hate Australians.

Danny and Liz share a look.

                             DANNY/TOM
                  You got a bathroom I can use before
                  we hit the road?

                             BO
                  Yeah? First door on the right.
                  It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda'
                  filthy is all.

                             DANNY/TOM
                       (to Liz)
                  You mind?



                             BO
                  No, I don't mind.  That's how come I
                  told you about it.

                             DANNY/TOM
                  I was talking to my wife.

                             LIZ
                  Try to make it fast.

Danny heads down the hallway, Liz looks a little uncomfortable.

                             LIZ (cont'd)
                       (trying to make small talk)
                  So.  What do you do for a living around here?

                             BO
                  You know. This and that.

ON THE SHELVES, SUNDRY ITEMS USED TO DISTILL METH.

Bo scratching his arms.

Liz notices TRACK MARKS ALL OVER BO'S ARMS.  He sees her looking.

                             BO
                  Skeeters. They're bad up here.

INT. BATHROOM - SAME

Danny peeing WHEN HE HEARS ANOTHER CAR PULL UP OUTSIDE.  CAR DOORS OPEN 
AND CLOSE.  HUSHED VOICES  OUTSIDE THE BATHROOM WINDOW.

Danny finishes up.  He steps up onto the tub and peaks out the bathroom 
window.

THROUGH THE WINDOW - TWO FIGURES CROSS IN FRONT OF THE HEADLIGHTS OF 
THE CAR.  THE ENGINE REMAINS RUNNING.

Danny frowns, not sure what to make of it.  He steps down from the tub 
and is just about to exit when THE FRONT DOORS IS KICKED OPEN AND SHOTS 
ARE FIRED.

VOICES SHOUTING.

Danny freezes, not sure what to do. His eyes dart around for a weapon.

He picks up a large plumber's wrench and goes to the bathroom door.

MORE SHOTS.  SEMI-AUTOMATIC FIRE.

SEVERAL BULLETS slam through the bathroom wall, one striking Danny in 
the shoulder.

He slumps to the floor.

THE PANDEMONIUM continues in the front room.

There is a BULLET HOLE about the size of a fifty cent piece in the wall 
next to Danny's head.  He puts his eye to the hole and looks out.

DANNY'S P.O.V. THROUGH THE HOLE - scanning the room.  Stopping on ...

... LIZ. In the confusion, she has managed to hide from the intruders.  
She is squeezed into a tiny space between the sofa and the wall.  She 
clings tightly to the curtains, her hands shaking violently.

ONE THE CURTAIN RINGS - pulled taught by Liz's grip.

Danny adjusts his gaze through the hole.

THROUGH THE HOLE - scanning to the other side of the room.  Bo and the 
other guy sprawled on the floor. INTRUDER ONE stands over them, only 
his legs visible.

BACK ON LIZ - scared to death, clinging to the curtains.

The curtain rings are pulled to the breaking point.


INTRUDER ONE
Let's go!

INTRUDER TWO emerges from the back carrying a small nylon bag.  They 
start to head out the front door when ...

... one of the curtain rings breaks with a METALLIC "TING".

ON DANNY - freaking. His eyes shooting back to Liz.

SILENCE.

Listening.

Then the CREAKING FOOTSTEPS of Intruder One approaching. It takes an 
eternity.

Liz can't possibly see Danny through the hole but it looks like she is 
staring directly at him, her body rigid with fear.

Danny grabs the wrench again.  Tries to get to his feet but slips back 
down, either too weak from loss of blood or just plain scared.  His 
hand is shaking violently.

He looks through the hole again.

THROUGH THE HOLE - Liz still staring at Danny. THE FOOTSTEPS CONTENCE 
at a agonizing slow pace, then stop.

A GUN, ever so slowly, enters FRAME. EXTREME CLOSE UP on Liz's eyes as 
they widen.

EXTREME CLOSE UP on Danny's eye peering through the hole. A SHOT IS 
FIRED. His eye closes.

ON DANNY-his mouth opens to scream BUT NOTHING COMES OUT.

And with that it is all over.

Danny tries to get to his feet again. Fails, His eyes flutter. All is 
silent except for A FAINT LIQUID SPATTERING.

LONG SHOT-Back on the Salton Sea, placid and silvered with moonlight.

INT RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM- NIGHT (LATER)

Danny and Colette face-to face- in profile, silhouetted by the IMAGE of 
the sea.

                             DANNY
                  She died knowing that I was a coward...
                  that I didn't lift a finger to help her.

                             COLLETTE
                  There was nothing you could have done.

She is inches closer to him.


                             DANNY
                  No, you're wrong, I tried to tell 
                  myself the same thing but I could
                  have gotten up. I could have done 
                  something.

                             COLETTE
                  They would have killed you too.

                             DANNY
                       (finally looks her in the eye)
                  Nothing could be worse then this 
                  slow death I'm living now.

Colette puts her arms around him and hugs him tight. The IMAGE OF THE 
SEA FLICKERS AND FADES behind them.

CLOSE ON DANNY-holding Colette.

                             DANNY
                       (looking up)
                  Colette...I want to help 
                  you, with Quincey.

Colette pulls back.

                             COLETTE
                  No Danny, Don't-


                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  But you gotta be serious about it.

                             COLETTE
                  Really, I don't want to.

                             DANNY
                  I want to do this for you.  I 
                  want to do something good 
                  for a change.

Danny goes over to the dresser. Takes out a baggie of meth.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  I want you to hide this
                  somewhere where Quincy
                  won't find it.

                             COLETTE
                  What is it?

                             DANNY
                  Never mind. Just do what I say.
                  He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.

                             COLETTE
                  I don't want to.

Danny stalks her.

                             DANNY
                  I'm offering you the chance to take 
                  care of your problems. Take it.
                       (she still hesitates)
                  Don't make the same mistake I did,
                  Colette. Do something while you 
                  have a chance. Do it for your daughter 
                  before something happens.
                       (beat)
                  Believe me, you don't want to 
                  live with this burden.
                       (firm)
                  He helds the baggie out again. Colette 
                  reluctantly takes it from him.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Tommorrow night, when he is asleep. 
                  I want you to beep me at this number.
                  He writes the number down on a dollar bill.

                             DANNY
                  Will you do that?
                       (off her nod)
                  Then I want you to get out of the room.

                             COLETTE
                  Why?

                             DANNY
                  Don't worry about it. Just go across 
                  the street and watch. You'll know 
                  when it's safe to go back.

Colette goes to protest. Danny puts his hand to her mouth the same way 
she did to him earlier.

                             DANNY
                  Just do it. All your problems with 
                  Quincey will be taken care of.

INT. CINDER BLOCK BAR - DAY

Empty except for Danny and Jimmy in a back booth. Danny slides an 
envelope over to Jimmy.

                             JIMMY
                  What's this?

                             DANNY
                  Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare.
                       (beat)
                  It's for you.

                             JIMMY
                  But why? You only owe me five. And 
                  that's not till after we close the deal tonight.

                             DANNY
                  You aren't coming with me.

Jimmy looks hurt.


                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  I need you to do me a favor instead.

                             JIMMY
                  Okay

                             DANNY
                  Wait till I tell you what it is.

                             JIMMY
                  It don't matter. I'll do it. And you
                  sure as hell don't have to pay me.

Jimmy slides the money back over.

                             DANNY
                  Why?

                             JIMMY
                  You're my best friend, man. I'd do 
                  anything for you.

Danny smiles, genuinely touched.

                             DANNY
                  Jimmy, look, there's something I have
                  to tell you.

                             JIMMY
                  Hey, check it out...

Jimmy rolls his sleeve up, revealing a tattoo.


                             DANNY
                  What the hell is that?

ON THE TATTOO: CRUDLEY DRAWN FACE.

                             JIMMY
                       (Proudly)
                  It's you! I didn't have a picture or
                  nothin' so I had to describe you to
                  the guy. Not bad though, huh?

Jimmy sits there, admiring the tattoo.

Danny stares at Jimmy with pity.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  I really have to tell you something.
                  It's important.

                             JIMMY
                  What?

                             DANNY
                  I'm not a tweaker.
                       (beat)
                  I don't use drugs. I never had.

Danny is deadpan.  Jimmy starts laughing

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  I'm not joking.

Jimmy keeps laughing. Danny staring, deadpan, Jimmy slowly stops 
laughing.

                             JIMMY
                  But...I've seen you.

                             DANNY
                  When? When did you ever see me use?

                             JIMMY
                  This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth
                  question, is it?

                             DANNY
                  You ever notice how I always showed 
                  up, in the middle of a binge? Left 
                  before it was over? How I sneak away 
                  for cap-naps? How when the crank 
                  came around to me, I always said I'd 
                  just done one?

Jimmy slack-jawed.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  You asked me how I always keep my 
                  shit together. Well, that's how.

                             JIMMY
                  No one ever noticed?

                             DANNY
                  Are you kidding me? A bunch of amped
                  -out tweakers? It was easy.

Jimmy is agitated and confused.

                             JIMMY
                  But... why? Why would you pretend?

                             DANNY
                  I can't tell you.

                             JIMMY
                  You don't trust me?

                             DANNY
                  I don't trust anybody.

                             JIMMY
                  And you want me to do you some big favor?

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  It's cool. I understand
                  Danny gets up to leave.

                             JIMMY
                  Wait
                       (beat)
                  If you don't trust me, why did you 
                  tell me that stuff about not using drugs?

                             DANNY
                  Because I don't want to see you end 
                  up like Kujo and those other losers.
                       (beat)
                  I thought that maybe if you knew that 
                  I didn't use, you might see it in 
                  yourself to go clear.

EXT. BACK OF CINDERBLOCK BAR- DAY (LATER)

Jimmy and Danny squinting in the mid-morning sun. They stand face-to-
face.

                             DANNY
                  You mad at me, Jimmy?

Jimmy shrugs.

                             JIMMY
                  I don't know... a little. I wish you 
                  would have let me in on it from the 
                  beginning.

                             DANNY
                  I'm sorry. I couldn't.

Danny taps Jimmy's arm.

                             DANNY
                  You know you can get that tattoo removed,
                  don't you.

Jimmy rubs his arm where the tattoo is.

                             JIMMY
                  Nah... I want to keep it.
                       (beat)
                  Maybe I can use it for like, inspiration
                  ...you know...like when
                  I detox?

                             DANNY
                  Good for you Jimmy.

Danny takes the envelope from his pocket.

                             DANNY
                  I really want you to take this.

Danny tries to hive Jimmy the envelope. Jimmy pushes it away.

                             JIMMY
                  Wouldn't be a favor if you were 
                  paying me. I'll just take my five 
                  when the deal is done.

                             DANNY
                  You're a good man. Jimmy the Finn.

Tanner and Garcetti listening through earpieces.

BUBBA answers a cell phone on the other end.

                             BUBBA
                  Yeah.

CONVERSATION WILL INTERCUT BETWEEN TWO LOCATIONS

                             DANNY
                  Everything go?

                             BUBBA
                  Yeah.

                             DANNY
                  Just make sure you come alone. This 
                  guy won't like any surprises

                             BUBBA
                  I ain't a idiot, asshole.

                             DANNY
                  I'll see you tonight.

Bubba hangs up.

Danny turns the phone off.

                             TANNER
                  Man of few words.

Danny hands the phone back to Garcetti

                             GARCETTI
                  Nervous?

                             DANNY
                  With you clowns watching my back? What 
                  do you think?

Danny opens the back door.

                             GARCETTI
                  Just make sure you hit the floor when 
                  we come in. It could get ugly in there.

                             TANNER
                  Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.

Danny gets out of the car. Shuts the door.

EXT. CAR-SAME

Danny watches them drive away. When he is sure that they are gone, he 
looks around. Sees...
...A PLUMBER'S TRUCK parked on the other side of the park.

INT. PLUMBER'S TRUCK-SAME
AN HISPANIC GUY behind the wheel.

HISPANIC GUY
He's coming in.

As Danny approaches the truck, the door slides open. He piles in.

                             VOICES (O.S.)
                  How'd it go?

                             DANNY
                  You tell me.

Danny pulls a TINY MICROPHONE AND WIRE from inside his shirt and hands 
it to...
...Bubba, who sits in front of a BANK OF LISTENING EQUIPMENT.

                             BUBBA
                  You ready to go meet the team?

EXT. FEDERAL BUILDING - WESTWOOD - DAY

The PLUMBER'S TRUCK enters the underground parking lot.

INT. F.B.I. OFFICES-DAY

TEN F.B.I. AGENTS in a small conference room, looking at...

...Danny and Bubba, sitting at the head of the table. BUBBA is now 
wearing his security badge, which reads, SPECIAL AGENT TEX TRAHN. He 
stands up and addresses the group.

And he really does have a SOUTHERN ACCENT.

                             TRAHN
                  For those of you who don't know this 
                  is Tom Van Allen... a.k.a.  Danny 
                  Flynne.

Danny looks self-conscious.

                             TRAHN (cont'd)
                  About a year and half ago, Mr. Van 
                  Allen's wife was murdered at a meth 
                  lab out near the Salton Sea. No one 
                  was ever apprehended for the crime 
                  but local authorities have always 
                  assumed it was a hit and grab 
                  perpetrated by rival drug dealers. 
                  That is, until Tom here took it upon 
                  himself to conduct a one-man 
                  undercover operation at great risk to 
                  his own personal safety.

One of the agents pipes up...

                             AGENT ONE
                  He's a civilian?
                       (off Trahn's nod)
                  How the hell did you pull this off?

Trahn turns to Danny.

                             DANNY
                  I played the long shot. Just got lucky.

INT. SALTON SEA SHERIFF'S STATION (FLASHBACK) - DAY

Danny and DETECTIVE BOOKMAN, a homicide detective, sitting at a table.

                             BOOKMAN
                  How about the car? The model?

Danny shakes his head.

                             BOOKMAN (cont'd)
                  Was it a truck?  S.U.V.? Sedan?


                             DANNY
                  All I saw was the headlights. The high 
                  beams were on.

                             BOOKMAN
                  Not even a guess?

                             DANNY
                       (pissed off0
                  How many times do we have to go through 
                  this?

ANOTHER DETECTIVE enters the room, hands something to bookman, then 
whispers into Bookman's ear. Bookman nods.

                             BOOKMAN (cont'd)
                  You said one of the perpetrators crossed 
                  in front of the headlights ...

                             DANNY
                  Yeah, but he was in silhouette.

                             BOOKMAN
                  How about in the house?

                             DANNY
                  They were wearing ski masks. I told 
                  you all of this.

                             BOOKMAN
                  Did you see his hair color?

                             DANNY
                  No, Why?

Bookman holds up a small plastic evidence baggie.

                             BOOKMAN
                  Forensics found this on your wife.

Bookman holds it up to the light. Inside, ONE BRIGHT RED HAIR.

The brightest, reddest hair you've ever seen with a BIG STREAK OF WHITE 
RUNNING THROUGH IT.

His back is TURNED. We can't see his face.

His arm and hands resting on top of the pump.

Danny looks at the guy's hand. A GUADY CLASS RING on his finger: EL

                             DANNY
                  Because I wanted to find them myself
                       (beat)
                  I wanted to kill them.

                  I swear to God I would have done 'em
                  right then and there...but I had to
                  be positive.  And even if Tanner was
                  involved, I had to be sure about
                             Garcetti

                  I gave up whoever they asked for, 
                  whenever they wanted. I was a 
                  fucking dream rat. But the whole 
                  time I was sizing them up, looking 
                  for any evidence that they were the 
                  guys who killed my wife.

F.B.I. OFFICES-DAY


                             DANNY
                  I knew that if these were the guys I 
                  was looking for, I'd have to set up a 
                  deal so sweet, they wouldn't be able 
                  to walk away from it.

                             TRAHN
                  That's when he called me. He told me 
                  his story and he pitched me a plan.

                             DANNY
                  These guys are smart. I knew they 
                  wouldn't hit a deal unless they knew 
                  all the players. I needed a big buyer.

EXT. ROOFTOP-NIGHT

Tanner and Garcetti watching Battle enter the building.

                             TRAHN (V.O.)
                  We had one of our C.I.'s call Tanner 
                  and Garcetti with an "anonymous" tip 
                  about the deal.

                             TANNER
                       (the line takes on a whole new meaning)
                  This could be the one we're looking for.

INT. F.B.I. OFFICES-DAY

Another agent kicks in.

                             AGENT TWO
                  How sure are you that you're not 
                  chasing two good cops? I mean all 
                  you've really got  is one red hair. 
                  That's still your only evidence.




                             TRAHN
                  Not anymore. We tapped these guys' phones 
                  and computers at Gardena P.D. 
                  Tanner and Garcetti didn't
                  report on this deal. Not a peep. 
                  They haven't coordinated with 
                  Palmdale P.D. They're keeping it off 
                  the books. It looks like we've got 
                  the right guys.
                       (beat)
                  We'll find out for sure tonight.

INT. F.B.I. OFFICES-DAY (LATER)

The meeting breaking up. Trahn walks Danny away from the conference 
room.

                             TRAHN
                  How you holding up?

                             DANNY
                  I'm fine. Little nervous...little 
                  disappointed that I didn't finish 
                  this myself.

                             TRAHN
                  Hey, you did the right thing. You 
                  wouldn't have stood a chance against 
                  these boys by yourself. They have 
                  eaten your ass alive.

Danny's PAGER STARTS BEEPING. He checks the readouts.

                             DANNY
                  Oh shit

                             TRAHN
                  What?

                             DANNY
                  Can you do me a favor? This girl I 
                  know, her boyfriend's a real piece of 
                  shit-dude's really jamming her up. 
                  I promised her I'd try to help.

Danny pockets the pager.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Could you call Gardena P.D. tell 'em 
                  you got a tip that the guy's holding?
                  Maybe have 'em send out a patrol car?

                             TRAHN
                  I'll see what I can do.

Tanner watching.

                             TANNER
                  Where's Bubba?

                             GARCETTI
                  Maybe he isn't showing.

Danny takes a gym bag out of the trunk and approaches Pooh-Bear's 
house.

                             TANNER
                  Looks like Flynne's handling the

They get out of the car and trek down the bluff towards the house.

INT. POOH-BEAR'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Big Bill lets Danny in, then pats him down for weapons.  Satisfied, he 
leads Danny to the kitchen.

IN THE KITCHEN - Danny enters and stops.  A worried look.

Pooh-Bear along with THREE OTHER MEN.  The men eye Danny silently.  
They look like ex-cons.

                             DANNY
                  What the hell is this?

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Just some buddies.

                             DANNY
                  This is bullshit.  You didn't say
                  anything about anybody else being here.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  What the fuck are you gonna do about
                  it, dickhead?

The other guys snicker, one of them almost spitting his beer out.

Danny smiles good-naturedly.  Shoots a look over at ...

... one of the guys sitting where he taped his gun earlier.

                             DANNY
                  Come on, man, let's deal.

He throws the bag on the table, knocking a beer into the guys lap.  The 
guy springs up, pissed off.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Cool it. We got business.

                             DANNY
                  Yeah, dickhead.

Danny moves over and plops down in the guys seat.

UNDER THE TABLE - Danny fumbling with the gun, trying to untape it 
without being too obvious.

Pooh-Bear unzips the bag. Inside, a lot of cash.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Oh my, oh my.
                       (beat)
                  Big Bill, come take a look at this.

Big Bill is behind Danny, over by the sink.  He pulls his FLINTLOCK and 
walks over.

Danny continues trying to get the gun loose.  Something catches his eye 
...

... the MICROWAVE OVEN DOOR is open, casting a reflection of the room 
behind him.  Big Bill approaches Danny, pointing the gun at Danny's 
head.

The other men ease back from the table a little.

UNDER THE TABLE - Danny still can't get the gun loose.

ON THE REFLECTION - Big Bill right behind Danny.  He raises the 
flintlock.

Danny bugging.  He rips at the gun. Too late.

Big Bill goes to fire.  Using the reflection, Danny ducks at the last 
instant.

Big Bill FIRES.

The guy across the table takes the mini-ball in the chest.

ALL IN AN INSTANT - Danny extricates the gun.  Turns on Big Bill, who 
sees the gun and holds his hands up.

Danny SHOOTS TWICE, the bullets blowing through Big Bill's hands and 
thumping into his chest.  Big Bill crumples.

When Pooh-Bear goes to pull his gun from his waist-band, it discharges, 
shooting him in the thigh.

The muzzle flash ignites his pants leg.  POOH-BEAR HITS THE FLOOR, 
SCREAMING, slapping at the fire on his leg.

Danny wheels on the other two guys at the table, who are going for 
their guns.  Danny opens up on them with the Glock, flooring them 
before they can get a shot off.

OUTSIDE - still descending the bluff, Tanner and Garcetti hear the 
gunfire.

INSIDE - Danny turns on Pooh-Bear, who sits there staring at his 
injured leg.

Danny puts the gun to Pooh-Bear's head, closes his eyes and starts to 
pull the trigger.

Pooh-Bear lifts his gun and SHOOTS DANNY IN THE TORSO THREE TIMES.  
Danny collapses.

Pooh-Bear gets to his feet.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Oh lordy, oh lordy, oh lordy.  Pooh-
                  Bear done shot himself.

He's in shock.  He grabs the duffle bag from the table and staggers 
down the hallway, into the living room.

OUTSIDE - Tanner and Garcetti at the front door, listening. They pull 
their ski-masks on, take out their guns, then silently enter.

INSIDE - gunsmoke abounds.  One of the guys MOANS on the floor.

Tanner and Garcetti enter the kitchen, guns drawn and ready.  They 
survey the scene.

Bodies everywhere.

Big Bill lays there dying, staring with confusion at the stigmata in 
his hands.

Danny lying in a heap, next to Big Bill.

Suddenly, they hear POOH-BEAR MUMBLING from somewhere in the house.

Tanner signals for Garcetti to take point.  They head down the long 
hallway, slowly and silently.  When they are gone ...

... Danny stirs on the floor. His eyes open. He opens his shirt and 
checks his torso REVEALING THAT HE IS WEARING HIS BULLET-PROOF VEST.

He struggles to a sitting position, in great pain from the impact 
bruises left by the bullets.

He picks up his gun, gets up on wobbly legs and follows Tanner and 
Garcetti down the hall.

ON DANNY as he creeps down the hall.

INT. CREEPY HOUSE - SALTON SEA - NIGHT

Exiting the bathroom and creeping towards the front room.

                             DANNY
                  Anybody there?

ONLY THE SPLATTERING LIQUID SOUND.

Danny continues.

He stops at the end of the hall.  His eyes go wide with fear and 
revulsion.

THE LIQUID SOUND BECOMES LOUDER AND LOUDER UNTIL IT IS ALL THAT CAN BE 
HEARD.

Liz is still in her hiding place behind the end of the couch.  Her head 
is resting comfortably on the arm of the couch.  She looks fine.  There 
is even a slight smile on her lips.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Liz?

Then he notices it ...

... a widening pool of BLOOD seeps from under the couch like some 
living thing.  More blood patters down from some UNSEEN WOUND on the 
side of her head.

Danny staggers towards her.

Her eyes flutter slightly.

Danny sits next to her. Holds her hand.  There is nothing he can do.

Liz tries to speak.  Can't.

                             DANNY
                  I'm here, Liz. I'm here.

She squeezes his hand.  Then goes limp.

INT. POOH-BEAR'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Danny continues down the hall, remembering.

INT. CREEPY HOUSE - SALTON SEA - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Danny sitting there with Liz in a pool of blood.  He notices something 
on the floor ...

... LIZ'S PURSE, the contents spilled on the floor.  A GREETING CAR 
with a teddy bear and the word "CONGRATUALTIONS" on the front.

Danny goes over and picks up the card.

INSERT - CARD

He opens it  ... "YOU'RE A DADDY!"  A home pregnancy test taped inside, 
the reading is POSITIVE.

Danny drops the card.  Stares down at it as ...

... the blood from the floor pools out and engulfs the card.

EXT. SALTON SEA - NIGHT

ON DANNY standing in the hallway, staring, his face a blank.

ON POOH-BEAR - cooking up a huge dose of meth with a lighted hundred 
dollar bill.

He draws the meth into a syringe then turns on the stereo with a 
remote.

A YODELING INSTRUCTION TAPE BLASTS FROM THE SPEAKERS.

Pooh-Bear prepares to dose, looking for a vein in his neck, never 
noticing ...

... Garcetti's gun moving to the back of Pooh-Bear's head.

Pooh-Bear about to plunge the drugs when GARCETTI FIRES.

Pooh-Bear pitches forward, dead.  The syringe falls to the floor.

Tanner and Garcetti standing over him.  They pull their ski masks off.

                             GARCETTI
                  Get the bag.

Garcetti holsters his weapon and picks up the bag of money from the 
floor.

                             GARCETTI (cont'd)
                  Let's get out of here.

A GUNSHOT.  Garcetti goes down where he stands.  He lays there 
twitching like a rabbit.

Tanner staring down the sucker's end of Danny's gun.

                             TANNER
                  Danny?

                             DANNY
                  My name is Tom.

Tanner frowns.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Tom Van Allen

Danny raises his gun.

                             TANNER
                  Whatever you say, man.  Look ... can
                  we talk about this?

                             DANNY
                  Yeah. Okay. Listen carefully ...
                       (beat)
                  You're in the bathroom.  You've been
                  shot in the shoulder ...

Danny shoots Tanner in the shoulder.  He collapses to the floor.

ON GARCETTI - his eyes flutter and open.

Danny walks over to Tanner and stands above him.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  ... there's two guys with masks and
                  guns in the other room about to kill
                  your wife.

Tanner looks at Danny, confused.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  But you know if you go out there,
                  they'll kill you, too.  You'll both
                  die.  What do you do?

Tanner realizes what Danny is talking about.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Do you go out there and die like a
                  man or do you live to fight another day?

Tanner doesn't answer.

                             Danny (cont'd)
                  What do you do?

Still no answer.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Answer the question!

Tanner is ghost white, loosing blood quickly.

                             Danny (cont'd)
                  What do you do!

                             TANNER
                  Please ... don't do this ...

                             DANNY
                  Answer the fucking question!

When Danny goes to shoot Tanner again ...

... Tanner pulls a K-BAR KNIFE from the back of his belt and plunges it 
into the back of Danny's gun hand.  The gun discharges, missing Tanner.

Danny drops the gun.  Tanner snatches it up.

Tanner immediately has the gun inches from Danny's head.  Danny freezes 
...

                             TANNER
                  Does that answer your question?
                       (beat)
                  I fight.
                  I fight and I die like a man.
                       (beat)
                  You're a fucking coward, Flynne.  You
                  lived like one and now you're gonna
                  die like one.

Danny looks up at the gun, his face a blank.

                             DANNY
                       (mumbling)
                  Glock semi-automatic 9 mm ...

CLOSE ON THE BARREL OF THE GUN.  ALL SOUND FADES OUT.

MOVE INTO THE BARREL OF THE GUN.  THE BLACK KID'S FACE APPEARS INSIDE.

                             KID
                  Tenifer matte finish, Polymer grip,
                  fixed sights, 4 and 1/2 inch barrel,
                  22 ounces, double action and a ...

QUICK FLASHES of all the shots Danny fired with the Glock.

- TWO at Big Bill
- FOUR at the guys at the table
- ONE at Garcetti
- THREE  at Tanner

THE KID AGAIN.

                             KID
                  ... and a TEN ROUND magazine ...

ON DANNY.  Still staring at the gun. He knows the gun is empty. He 
notices something on the floor ...

... THE LOADED SYRINGE.

                             KID (cont'd)
                  Or did I say ELEVEN?

Danny trying to remember.

                             KID (cont'd)
                  Which was it, mister?  Was it ten or was it eleven?
                       (beat)
                  Pretty big fucking difference if you ask me.

DANNY starts chuckling. Looks up at Tanner.


                             DANNY
                  It doesn't matter.

Danny looks down at the syringe again.  Tanner sees it too.

                             TANNER
                  Too late to be a hero.

Danny picks up the syringe.

Tanner pulls the trigger.

INSIDE THE GUN - MOVING SLOWLY towards the firing pin as it springs 
forward toward CAMERA with a LOUD CLICK.

THE GUN IS EMPTY.
                             DANNY
                  Ten it is.

Danny jams the SYRINGE INTO TANNER'S THROAT all the way down to the 
plunger, dosing him with the meth.

Tanner goes down, blood bubbling from his throat around the syringe.  
His eyes roll back as he  convulses from the drugs.

Danny struggles to his feet.

Tanner quivers from head to toe like some freaked-out Pentecostal in 
the throws of a holy possession.

Danny pulls the syringe from Tanner's throat.  A LONG WET WEEZE 
ESCAPES.

Suddenly, A NOISE BEHIND DANNY.

Garcetti standing there pointing his gun at Danny, rocking slightly 
back and forth, a bullet hole in his cheekbone.  He looks brain dead.

Danny doesn't move. TANNER STILL WHEEZING.

Garcetti looks like he wants to shoot his gun, but can't.  He keeps 
looking down at his hand, trying to get it to obey.

Danny calmly walks over and takes the gun from Garcetti.

Garcetti puts his hand to his nose and blows out a clot of blood.  He 
looks down at his hand.

He has hacked up the bullet he was shot with.

Garcetti smiles an embarrassed smile at Danny.  TANNER'S WHEEZING 
CONTINUES.

                             DANNY
                       (softly)
                  You're dead.

Garcetti nods slightly.  He goes to a kneeling position, then curls up 
on the floor like he is taking a nap and dies.

Danny goes over to the couch and sits down.

Danny with his head in his hands, emotionally and physically exhausted.  
TANNER WHEEZING LOUDER AND LOUDER.

CLOSE ON DANNY'S FACE.  Blank.  Devoid of anything.  He stuffs 
Garcetti's gun into his own mouth, hand shaking.

He takes the gun out.

Stuffs it back in again, shoving it way down, almost gagging on it.  
The barrel clatters against his teeth. He takes it out again.  THE 
WHEEZING CONTINUES.

Danny starts crying.  Lifts the gun halfway again, then drops it.

He jumps up.  Goes over to the still-wheezing Tanner and empties his 
clip into him.  When the clip is spent, Danny keeps pulling the trigger 
... over and over again.

He stands there pulling the trigger again and again and again and 
again.

                                                          FADE OUT.
                                                          FADE IN:

INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Danny dressed in his "Tom" clothes. He limps over to the bed and picks 
up the trumpet case.  Carries it over to the mirror.

Danny staring at his reflection. He lights a cigarette.

                             DANNY
                  My name is Tom Van Allen. I'm a
                  trumpet player.

Danny smiles.

                             VOICE (O.S.)
                  Nah, you're Danny Flynne.

He turns.

COLETTE and QUINCEY standing there.  Quincey holds a nine millimeter 
with a muzzle suppressor.

                             QUINCEY
                  You're a motherfucking rat.

He shoots Danny in the stomach.  Danny slumps to the floor.  His 
cigarette falls out of his mouth and rolls under the bed.

Colette freaks.

                             COLETTE
                  You said you wouldn't kill him!

She tries to go to Danny but Quincey stops her.

                             COLETTE
                  You lied to me!

                             QUINCEY
                  Oops.  My bad.

Danny looks at them, confused, a blood stain blossoming on his white 
shirt.


                             DANNY
                  Colette, what happened?  Didn't the cops ...

                             QUINCEY
                  The cops came.  But they didn't find
                  nothing.  Turns out their C.I. game
                  'em some bad information.

Quincey holds up the baggie of drugs.

Danny looks from Quincey to Colette.  Colette looks away.

                             QUINCEY (cont'd)
                  You fuck with the Mexicali Boys, this
                  is what you get, homes.

UNDER THE BED - the cigarette smoldering on the carpet.

                             QUINCEY (cont'd)
                  Domingo thought you might be the one
                  who went rat on him.

Quincey looks at Colette

                             QUINCEY (cont'd)
                  So I brought in a rat of my own.

Danny looks at Colette, dumbfounded.

                             DANNY
                  You set me up?

                             QUINCEY
                  Bitch played you like a squeezebox, Romeo.

Danny can't help from laughing at the irony.  Beads of sweat are 
forming on his blanched face.  He looks at Colette with a wry smile.

                             DANNY
                  You're good, princess. I'll give you that.

                             COLETTE
                  Danny, it's not what you think.

Danny looks down at his bloody stomach.

                             COLETTE
                  I owed them money ... a lot of
                  money ... they didn't give me a
                  choice.  You know how it works.  When
                  I got to know you, I tried to back
                  out ... that's when they did this ...
                       (she indicates the bruises)
                  But I told them I wouldn't do it .. I
                  didn't want to see you get hurt.

Danny stares at her, not sure what to believe.  He looks over at 
Quincey.

                             DANNY
                  She selling me a bill, home boy?

Quincey shakes his head.

                             QUINCEY
                  Nah, she ain't lying.  She took a
                  pretty good beating from you, ace. I
                  seen grown men crack after a lot
                  less.  But not this bitch.
                       (beat)
                  It was very touching.

                             DANNY
                  Then why are we here?

                             COLETTE
                  They threatened to kill my daughter.
                       (beat)
                  I had no choice.
                       (beat)
                  I'm sorry, Danny.

Danny looks at Colette, imagining the awful beating she must have 
taken.

                             DANNY
                  It's okay. It's okay.
                       (Danny touches her face.)
                       (beat)
                  God damn, you're beautiful.

UNDER THE BED - THE CARPET IGNITES.  The fire spreads quickly.

                             QUINCEY
                  Jesus.

Quincey grabs her arm.

                             QUINCEY (cont'd)
                  Let's go.

                             COLETTE
                  No!

The drapes go up in flames.  Quincey puts the gun to the back of her 
head.

                             QUINCEY
                  You wanna die here with him or come with me?


                             DANNY
                  Colette, go.

                             COLETTE
                  I don't want to leave you.

                             DANNY
                  Your daughter needs you.  Go.

The fire continues to spread.  Colette kisses Danny on the lips.  
Quincey pulls her away.

Collette looks back one last time just as the flames reach the door, 
cutting off any escape.

Danny breathing hard. He gets up.  Staggers over to the mirror where 
his trumpet is.

He opens the case and takes the trumpet out.

He plops down on the bed and BLOWS A FEW NOTES. He stops for a second, 
a smile on his lips.

He starts to play SAETA.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

INT. BURNING ROOM - NIGHT

Back to the opening scene.  The whole room ablaze.  Danny lying on the 
bed, playing the horn.

                             DANNY (V.O.)
                  So what is it?  Who am I after it's
                  all said and done?

Pieces of the roof start falling in.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Tom Van Allen or Danny Flynne?
                       (beat)
                  Avenging angel or plain old Judas?

He stops playing.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                       (weakly)
                  You decide, friend.  You decide.

He closes his eyes.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  I'm too tired ... so you decide.

He drops his trumpet and lays his head back.

                                                      CUT TO:

BLACK SCREEN

THEN BLURRY, VAGUE SLOW MOTION - moving through the flames.

CLOSE ON DANNY'S HEAD - seemingly floating through the fiery room.

                             DANNY (V.O.)
                  Oh shit. What is this?

Emerging from the flames into a dark hallway.

Danny's eyes flutter as he seemingly continues to float.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Am I dead?

A linoleum floor rushes underneath.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Linoleum.  This must be hell.

Danny head sags, finds himself staring at ...

...  A TATTOED LIKENESS OF HIMSELF.  The tattoo smiles and speaks.

                             TATTO
                       (warped, distorted)
                  Hang in there buddy.

Stairs rush by underneath.  Then another hallway.

DANNY'S P.O.V.  - a bright white light at the end of the hall.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Oh no.  What a fucking cliché.

On Danny's face, floating through the hall.  His eyes fluttering.

MOVING TOWARDS the light.  Closer.  Closer.

Danny's eyes close, his head droops.

                                                          FADE TO WHITE:


CLOSE ON DANNY as his eyes flutter and open.

DANNY'S P.O.V. - an image slowly coming into focus ...

... JIMMY staring down at him with concern.

Danny blinks his eyes again.  Looks up at ...

... A PARAMEDIC working on him.

Danny smiles a weak smile at Jimmy.

Jimmy just sits there, nodding his head, a big shit-eating grin on his 
face.

The paramedic continues to work on Danny.  His eyes slowly close.

                                                          FADE OUT.
                                                          FADE IN:

EXT. THE CITY - DAY

Danny exits a cab and heads towards a coffee shop.  He looks like a new 
man.

                             DANNY (V.O.)
                  Well, I've had some time to think
                  about it and it's pretty simple after
                  all.  I guess it's like the man said -
                  "Man is the measure of all things."
                  I should know.  I ran the gamut.
                  Avenging Angel, Judas, loving
                  husband, prodigal son, prince of
                  Denmark.  I was all of those things.
                       (beat)
                  Tom Van Allen got his revenge.
                  Good for Tom.  And Danny Flynne? He
                  got gut-shot for being the low-life
                  rat that he was.  Sucks for him.
                       (beat)
                  But as far as I'm concerned, they're both dead.

Danny looks through the window of the shop.

Colette inside, working the counter, pouring coffee.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  But what about this guy? Who is he?

Danny enters the shop.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  To tell you the truth, I don't know yet.

INT. COFFE SHOP - SAME

Danny takes a seat at the counter.  Colette turns and sees him.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  But I like his chances.

They stare at one another for a beat, then smile.  Colette pours him 
some coffee.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  I really like his chances.

They strike up a conversation as we ...

                                                          FADE OUT. 

THE END

INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

A MAN recumbent on the bed, playing a TRUMPET, his white dress shirt 
defaced by a flower of blood.  The room is ON FIRE all around him.

He is playing Miles Davis' moody, Spanish-influenced SAETA, a haunting 
and lonely piece.

                             DANNY (V.O.)
                  My name is Tom Van Allen ...
                       (beat)
                  or Danny Flynne ...

A DUFFLE BAG FULL OF MONEY ON THE BED.  The money burning, tiny flaming 
pieces floating around the room.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  ... I don't know anymore.
                       (beat)
                  Maybe I'll let you decide.  Maybe you
                  can help me, friend.  As you can see,
                  I don't have a hell of a lot of time left.

A PHOTOGRAPH of a woman taped to the inside of a trumpet case. The 
photo is on fire.  Only her smile remains.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Avenging angel ... Judas Iscariot ...
                  Loving husband ... Prodigal Son ...
                  The prince of Denmark ...?

A GREETING CARD on the floor, a teddy bear and the word, 
CONGRATULATIONS! on the front.  The wind from the fire blows the card 
open.  Inside, a BLACKENED BLOOD STAIN.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  All of these? None of these? You
                  decide, friend.  You decide. Trumpet
                  player? Speed freak?
                       (beat)
                  Speed freak.
                       (beat)
                  That's as good a place as any.
                       (beat)
                  But first, a little background on the
                  mad world of the tweaker ..


                                                          FADE OUT.

                                                          FADE IN.


INT. LABORATORY - DAY

EXTREME CLOSE-UP of a glass pipette dripping a clear liquid into a 
glass beaker.

                             DANNY (V.O.)
                  Methedrene was first distilled by a
                  Japanese scientist before WWII.
                  Hand it to the Japanese, they knew a
                  good thing when they saw it.

INT. JAPANESE ZERO - DAY

A wide-eyed, jaw-grinding KAMIKAZE PILOT with a death-grip on the 
controls.

                             DANNY (V.O.)
                  This guy's so tweaked, he probably thinks
                  he can survive this without a scratch.

STOCK BATTLE FOOTAGE - a Japanese Zero crashes into a battleship, 
bursting into a ball of flames.

                             DANNY (V.O.)
                  Maybe not.
                       (beat)
                  By some estimates, 2% of the Japanese
                  population had a meth problem after
                  the war: factory workers, soldiers,
                  pilots.  Maybe that's why it took two
                  bombs to get 'em to surrender.  A
                  nuclear blast is just a minor
                  nuisance to a determined tweaker.

INT. HOUSE - DAY

A wide-eyed, June Cleaveresque housewife in a picture-perfect white 
dress vacuums the floor of a picture-perfect house.

                             DANNY (V.O)
                  In the fifties, the housewives got
                  ahold of it.  Dexedrine. Benzedrine.
                  Methedrene ...

She attacks the same spot over and over again, one hand clutching the 
vacuum, the other stiffly holding a cigarette.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Now that's a classic speed freak for
                  you, skinny and cleaning the house.  I'll
                  bet her poor husband never knew what
                  hit him in the sack either.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

THE LEG OF THE BED rattling and bouncing loudly off the floor.

STOCK FOOTAGE - J.F.K. pumping the hand of NIKITA KRUSCHEV.

                             DANNY (V.O.)
                  There were even rumors that one of
                  our presidents dabbled with
                  mysterious "energy shots".  Imagine
                  that: a slammer in the White House.

Kennedy talking animatedly.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  If it's true, I'll bet ol' Krushchev
                  never got a word in edgewise.

EXT. TRUCK STOP PARKING LOT - NIGHT

A sleepy-eyed TRUCKER emerges from his tractor-trailer and approaches a 
loitering HELL'S ANGELS-type.

                             DANNY (V.O.)
                  By the late 60's the government
                  finally cracked down and sent the
                  whole thing underground.  Bikers
                  controlled the market for a while.

INT.  TRACTOR-TRAILER - NIGHT

The trucker gripping the wheel with the same death-grip as the 
Kamikaze.

                             DANNY (V.O.)
                  But now anyone with a basic chemistry
                  kit and the right ingredients can
                  cook it up at home.

INT. PHARMACY - NIGHT

A CASHIER scanning container after container of COLD MEDICATION.

                             DANNY (V.O.)
                  Ever see a long-haired tattooed freak
                  buying up all the cold medicine he
                  can lay his hands on at three in the morning.

The cashier looks up at the aforementioned FREAK, a frozen grin 
plastered on his face.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Take it from me, he ain't got no
                  cold.  He's a cook.  Look in his
                  kitchen and you'll find a whole
                  grocery list of unsavory ingredients.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

TRACK DOWN the kitchen counter on various containers.

                             DANNY (V.O.)
                  Drain cleaner, hydrochloric acid,
                  match heads for red phosphorus,
                  ether and of course the cold
                  medicine .. that's for Ephedrene,
                  soon to become Methedrene

CONTINUE TRACKING to a series of BURNERS, BEAKERS and TUBING

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  This guy's a regular Julia Child.
                  Problem is, I'll be even Miss Julia
                  fucks up the bouillabaisse from time to time.

The freaky cook sees something he doesn't like. His eyes widen.


                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Oh-oh.

EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT

As the structure explodes.

INT. PARTY HOUSE - UNKNOWN

Thick blankets and tinfoil taped over the windows.

A huge container of empty beer cans, washed and neatly arranged.

Lines of crystal meth on a mirror as precisely arranged as Nails as the 
Nuremberg rally.

A GROUP OF TWEAKERS in the middle of a binge.

Two skinny women, NANCY and Teresa bent over a drawer-full of neatly 
folded socks on the living room floor.  They stare at the drawer as if 
they were pondering a Rembrandt.

                             NANCY
                  It ain't right

                             TERESA
                  You think?

                             NANCY
                  Something's off.

                             TERESA
                  We can do better.

They take the socks out and being rearranging them again.

Three guys squeezed onto a couch together: KUJO, JIMMY THE FINN and 
CREEPER.  Kujo is talking a blue-streak.  He makes Dennis Leary took 
mealy-mouthed.

Creeper and Jimmy stare straight ahead, clearly bugging.

                             KUJO
                  So the alphabet, I mean look at it,
                  there's 26 letters.  Why not 27 or 28
                  or 106?  And the vowels: a, e, i, o, u.
                  What the hell is up with that?


                             CREEPER
                  And sometimes y.

                             KUJO
                  What I'm saying is that I love it!
                  It's great. I could go on all night about it.

And he does.

                             KUJO (cont'd)
                  Let's take every letter individually.
                  I mean, let's really break the
                  mother's down.

DANNY is sitting in an armchair.  He is the only one who looks tired.  
He sits there, taking the scene in.

ALL SOUNDS FADE OUT

                             DANNY (V.O.)
                  And so this is where I find myself.
                  No. I should choose my words more
                  wisely: this is the world I sought
                  out.  The land of the perpetual night-
                  party.  Day swallowing night and
                  night swallowing day.  The crank
                  compressing time like some divine
                  piston on its awesome downstroke.

DANNY'S P.O.V. - SCANNING THE ROOM.  NO SOUND.  The girl's folding the 
socks ... Kujo ranting on ... Creeper and Jimmy the Finn grinding their 
jaws ... the BLANKETS AND TINFOIL ON THE WINDOWS.


                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  We've been at this for three days ...
                  or is it four?  Tweakerrs, lokers,
                  slammers coming and going, swearing
                  eternal allegiance and undying love
                  for one another, only to wake up
                  after the binge and realize you
                  wouldn't walk across the street to
                  piss on one of 'em if their head was on fire.
                       (beat)
                  Is it three days or is it four?

BACK ON DANNY. He blinks lethargically.


                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  I know what you're thinking. But
                  don't give up on me just yet.  And
                  for God's sake, don't pity me. Don't
                  make any judgments until you've seen
                  my whole story.
                       (beat)
                  And keep your eyes open.
                       (beat)
                  Nothing is what it seems.

Suddenly ...

                             KUJO (O.S.)
                  OH SHIT! WE'RE OUT OF DRUGS!

INT. PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT 

Danny and Jimmy the Finn walking towards the front door.

                             DANNY
                  How the hell did we get this detail?

                             JIMMY
                  Guess it's our turn.

Danny nods.

                             DANNY
                  What time is it?

                             JIMMY
                  Twelve

                             DANNY
                  Midnight?

EXT. PARTY HOUSE - DAY 

As the door opens, Danny discovers that it is TWELVE NOON and the sun 
is blazing.

The party house is revealed as a cheap stucco apartment building 
crammed in the middle of BUSY BUSINESS DISTRICT at a major 
intersection.

Jimmy and Danny slip on sunglasses and brave the light.

                             DANNY
                  Where to?

                             JIMMY
                  I know a guy.

                             DANNY
                  Lead the way.

They slink along like two albino rat vampires with sunglasses.

                             JIMMY
                  Nice day

                             DANNY
                  I hadn't noticed.
                       (beat)
                  I've seen you around.  What's your name?

                             JIMMY
                  Jimmy.  Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn.

                             DANNY
                  Why's that?

                             JIMMY
                  My features. They're Finnish.

                             DANNY
                  You don't say.

                             JIMMY
                  Finland is a country.

                             DANNY
                  Well, Jimmy the Finn, let's go score some gack.

INT. CHEAP MOTEL ROOM - DAY

Danny and Jimmy standing there looking at something OFF SCREEN.  Danny 
and Jimmy looking at one another, then back at what they were looking 
at.

A GUY sitting on the bed in his underwear, looking down at his left arm 
and holding a can of BUG SPRAY at the ready in his right hand.

He is completely motionless, studying his arm with hypnotic intensity.

                             JIMMY
                  Bobby?

                             BOBBY
                  Shhh.

Bobby never takes his eyes off his arm.

                             BOBBY (cont'd)
                       (whispering)
                  They're coming.

                             JIMMY
                       (likewise whispering)
                  What?

                             BOBBY
                  The spiders.

Bobby readies the can of bug spray, his eyes widening.

                             BOBBY (cont'd)
                       (sing-song)
                  I'm ready for you this time.

Bobby lets loose with the spray, dousing his arm.

                             BOBBY
                  Aha! Yeah!
                       (super rapid-fire)
                  You thought you could fuck with
                  Bobby, you thought you could fuck
                  with Bobby, you thought you could
                  fuck with Bobby!

Bobby's mouth wide with stupid joy and continues to cloud the air with 
bug spray.

                             BOBBY (cont'd)
                  With Bobby you thought you could fuck?

Danny and Jimmy wait silently.  Bobby finally stops spraying, satisfied 
he has killed the imaginary spiders.

He looks up at Jimmy and Danny, his eyes swimming with stupid, drug-
addled confusion.

                             BOBBY (cont'd)
                  Who the fuck are you?

                             JIMMY
                  It's me ... Jimmy

Bobby squints.

                             BOBBY
                  Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Rhymes with Simmy.

                             JIMMY
                  Yeah.

                             BOBBY
                  What can I do for you?

                             JIMMY
                  Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us.

Danny and Jimmy notice something simultaneously.

There is something under the mattress - A HUGE BULGE.

                             BOBBY
                  Don't pay her no mind.

A MUFFLED MOAN from under Bobby.  She is between the mattress and the 
box springs. 

                             BOBBY (cont'd)
                  Shut the hell up, goddamit!

Bobby starts slapping the top of the mattress with his hand.  New 
MUFFLED SCREAMS from underneath.

                             BOBBY (cont'd)
                  I got no vocation skills!  What the
                  fuck you want from me?
                       (keeps slapping)
                  I got no vocation skills!

                             JIMMY
                  Hey man, take it easy.

Bobby immediately stops.  Looks at Jimmy with incredulity.

                             BOBBY
                  What?

                             JIMMY
                  Come on.  Ease off the girl.

Bobby springs from the bed, grabbing something as he rises.

Danny and Jimmy suddenly staring at a SPEARGUN which is loaded with two 
stainless steel spears.

Bobby stands there alternately pointing the speargun at Jimmy, then 
Danny.

                             BOBBY
                  Did you bring the plastic men?

Bobby nods towards something behind Danny.  Danny and Jimmy don't move 
or speak.

                             BOBBY (cont'd)
                  Did you bring the plastic men?
                       (beat)
                  Did you bring the plastic men?

Bobby rubs his nose.

                             BOBBY
                  Did ... you ... bring ... the ... plastic ... men?

                             DANNY
                  Nah, we didn't bring 'em.  That's
                  just your good crank talking, brother.

Bobby tilts his head.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  We were hoping to catch a few ourselves
                  if you'll hook us up.

                             BOBBY
                       (calmer)
                  You bring the plastic men?

                             DANNY
                  Like I said.

                             JIMMY
                  Fuck man. Come on, Bobby.

                             BOBBY
                  Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.  Rhymes with ...
                       (he draws a blank)

                             DANNY
                  Hobby?

Bobby twists a smile, revealing speed-blackened teeth.

                             BOBBY
                  That's a good man. I like that.

                             DANNY
                       (calmly)
                  Hey, Bobby, look .. What you got
                  going with your old lay, it's none
                  of our business. We're just a couple
                  of dope fiends trying to score.

Bobby lowers his speargun.

                             BOBBY
                  Two eight balls?

Jimmy breaths a sigh of relief.

EXT. CHEAP MOTEL ROOM - DAY

Danny and Jimmy exit the room, closing the door behind them.  Danny 
looks at Jimmy.

                             DANNY
                  Nice dealer you got there, Jimmy.

                             JIMMY
                  Oh ... that.  Ah, he was just juiced.
                  He wouldn't have did nothin'

WHAP, WHAP! Two spears plunge through the cheap door, stopping inches 
from Danny's head.

They run like hell.

EXT. SKY - DAY

TIME LAPSE.  The sun plunges down.  The sky turns black.  The moon 
races up and down.  The sky lightens.  The sun races up and down.  
Night comes again.

INT. PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT

Everyone crashing.  Jonestown, post Kool-Aid.  It looks like they have 
all simultaneously fallen asleep where they were standing or sitting.

Danny stirs awake.  Looks around.  He stretches.  KNOCKING OVER A 
BOTTLE OF BEER.

ALL OTHER SOUND FADES OUT AS the beer SPLATTER to the floor.  IT IS 
UNNATURALLY LOUD.

DANNY staring intently at the spilling liquid.

The beer pools up on the floor.

Danny transfixed by the image.

The last few drops of beer LOUDLY splashing down.

EXT PAYPHONE - NIGHT

Danny on the phone.



                             DANNY
                  C.I. number 678-43K-107
                       (beat)
                  Tanner and Garcetti

He hangs up.

EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

Danny waiting in the shadows.

A car, sans headlights, pulls into the alley and stops.

Danny emerges from the shadows, opens the back door and lays on the 
back seat.

INT. CAR - SAME

Two guys in suits in the front, TANNER and GARCETTI.  Tanner. blue eyes 
and SHAVED HEAD, an air of ex-military around him.  Garcetti: swarthly 
and serious, a MIASMA OF BAD-ASS ATTITUDE.

                             DANNY
                       (lying on the back seat)
                  I've got a hot one.

                             TANNER
                  You go, boy.

                             DANNY
                  If it's all the same to you, I'd
                  rather not dish right here in the
                  middle of Crankville.

Tanner drives out of the alley.

                             TANNER
                  Feeling the paranoia tonight, are we?

                             DANNY
                  Well, you know what they say, just
                  because you're paranoid, doesn't mean
                  everyone's not out to slice your
                  balls off and shove 'em down your throat.

EXT. PART - NIGHT

Danny, Tanner and Garcetti outside the car in a deserted park. Danny 
pacing.

                             TANNER
                  You got a name?

                             DANNY
                  Bobby, rhymes with hobby.

                             TANNER
                  What?

                             DANNY
                  Never mind.  Dude had a backfull of
                  jailhouse tatts.

QUICK FLASHES OF BOBBY'S TATTOOS.

                             TANNER
                  No last name?

                             DANNY
                  It was all pretty informal.  Didn't
                  have a lot of time to exchange
                  pleasantries.

Garcetti produces something from the front seat of the car and trudges 
over.

                             GARCETTI
                  This the guy?

                             DANNY
                  It speaks!

The humorless Garcetti hands Danny a "WANTED POSTER".  Bobby's mug shot 
glaring.

                             DANNY
                  That's him.  He's a lot prettier in
                  person though.

                             GARCETTI
                  Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.

                             DANNY
                  Dude is bugging.  Transparent
                  spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.

                             GARCETTI
                  What's he holding?

FLASHBACK - INT. CHEAP MOTEL ROOM - DAY 

Bobby's hand extracting the eightballs from a nylon bag full of meth.

                             DANNY (O.S.)
                  Couple of eightballs, maybe more.

QUICK SHOT of an open drawer.  A GUN can be glimpsed inside.



                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Cheap ass techno knockoff in the
                  drawer with extra mags.

ANOTHER QUICK GLIMPSE of the closet.  A shotgun butt visable 

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  12 gauge in the closet.

                             TANNER (O.S.)
                  Any company?

The WOMAN'S HAND protruding from underneath the mattress.

                             DANNY (O.S.)
                  Alas, the lovely Mrs. Bobby was
                  playing the bologna in a Posturpedic sandwich
                       (beat)
                  And there was a kid.

A SILHOUETTE visible through a crack in the BATHROOM DOOR.

                             TANNER (O.S.)
                  A kid?  Are you sure?

A BEAT-UP ELMO DOLL and SOME COLORING BOOKS on top of the dresser.

EXT. PARK - NIGHT

Back on Danny.
                             DANNY
                  Yeah. Pretty sure.
                       (beat)
                  Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too.

                             TANNER
                  God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.

                             DANNY
                  Somebody has to help you lazy bastards.

Garcetti looks at Danny with contempt.  They head back to the car.


                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Hey Tanner ... you be careful, okay?

                             TANNER
                  Danny, I'm touched.

                             DANNY
                  Don't be. I'm worried about the kid.

                             GARCETTI
                  Then why didn't you help the kid when
                  you were there?

                             DANNY
                  Hey, you want me to do all your work
                  for you, numbnuts?

Garcetti throws Danny up against the car.  Nose-to-nose.

                             GARCETTI
                  I'll tell you why you didn't help -
                  because you're a chickenshit tweaking
                  snitch.  You're a bottom feader,
                  Flynne.

                             DANNY
                  Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect.

Garcetti lets Danny go. Stomps off.

                             DANNY
                  You're welcome.

EXT. CHEAP MOTEL ROOM - DAY

A GAGGLE OF ONLOOKERS, including a NEWS CREW, watching from the parking 
lot.

BOBBY'S WOMAN screaming at the top of her lungs as she tries to get a 
Bobby's sheet-covered body.

A SWAT TEAM packing up nearby.  One of them suddenly does a graceful 
little Tai-Chi gesture.

A LITTLE GIRL clutches at the screaming woman's legs.

REVEAL DANNY, amongst the onlookers.  His expression gives nothing 
away.

A ribbon of blood snakes from Bobby's body, over the parking lot curb 
and runs into a storm drain.

As the blood SPLATTERS to the bottom, mixing with a pool of filthy 
water. THE SOUND IS UNNATURALLY LOUD.

INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL - GARDENA - NIGHT.

The place cries out "YOU HAVE FINALLY HIT THE ABSOLUTE BOTTOM!"

Danny exist the stairwell and approaches his door.

A WOMAN ONE DOOR DOWN FROM DANNY'S ROOM struggles with her groceries.  
When she goes to open the door, one of the  bags breaks, spilling its 
contents onto the floor.

Danny walks over.

                             DANNY
                       (approaching)
                  Let me help you with those.

She scoops up the groceries and hurries into her room.  Slamming the 
door behind her.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                       (loud through the door)
                  And to think Miss Manner was
                  living down the hall from me and I
                  didn't even know it!

There is a can on the floor.  Danny bends down to pick it up.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Hey, you left a can of ...

He looks at the can.

INSERT - CAN 

The label is in CHINESE.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  ... some Chinese looking shit out here.

No reaction.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  I'll just leave it by the door here.
                       (beat)
                  I'm going now!

After a moment, the door swings open.  Danny is holding the can out 
with a big smile on  his face.
                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  You really oughta be more careful.
                  This is not a good neighborhood.

The woman smiles.  A pretty smile.  Sad too.

                             WOMAN
                  I was rude. I'm sorry.  I'm kinda new around here.

                             DANNY
                  You did the right thing.
                       (handing the can over)
                  What is this stuff anyway?

                             WOMAN
                  Fermented soybean curd.

                             DANNY
                  Yummy.

She smiles again. World-weary.  Sweet. Those eyes.  Sad.  Sexy.  Sad 
and sexy.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  My name is Danny Flynne.
                       (off her silence)
                  And you are?

                             WOMAN
                  Colette Aragon. Thank you, Danny.

She closes the door abruptly.

INT. RESIDENTAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

The burning room from the opening scene.  Danny's dirty clothes on the 
bed.

He emerges from the shower, a towel wrapped around his waist.  There is 
a BIG STAR-SHAPED SCAR on Danny's shoulder.

He walks over to the closet, takes a METAL LOCKBOX from the top shelf 
and puts it on the bed.

Pulls a key from his pocket and unlocks the box. He sits there staring 
at the contents for a moment, then gingerly takes them out ...

... CLOTHES.  A white dress shirt, black slacks and wingtips.

INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Danny dresses in his clothes, combing his hair.  He goes back in the 
lock box and pulls something else out ...

... A TRUMPET CASE.  He walks over to the cheap vanity and sits down in 
front of the mirror and stars for a very long time.

                             DANNY
                  My name is Tom Van Allen
                       (beat)
                  I play the trumpet.

He slowly opens the trumpet case revealing a GLEAMING HORN inside.  
Runs his fingers along the length of it and up to ...

... A PHOTO OF A WOMAN taped to the inside of the lid.  A self-
conscious smile on her face like she's uncomfortable with having her 
picture taken.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                       (distant)
                  My name is Tom Van Allen. I play the trumpet.

He takes the trumpet from the case - A CHECK from a LIFE INSURANCE 
COMPANY and a DRIVER'S LICENSE with Danny's picture and the name TOM 
VAN ALLEN.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  My name is Tom Van Allen and I play the trumpet.

He starts to play.  "Saeta" again.

AN IMAGE appears on THE BLANK WALL BESIDE HIM.  MOVE OFF DANNY AND UP 
TO THE IMAGE.

IN THE IMAGE - A HUGE LAKE in the middle of the DESERT.  CONTINUE 
MOVING IN ON IMAGE AS WE CUT TO ...

EXT. SALTON SEA - SUNSET (FLASHBACK)

Danny and THE WOMAN FROM THE PHOTOGRAPH sitting on the shore.  Watching 
the sunset. She is his wife, LIZ.

Danny playing "SAETA" on his trumpet.

Danny and Liz are alone, except for the myriad birds, silhouetted by 
the falling sun.

A gust of wind rushes across the lake, blowing Liz's hair all around 
her face.

A dying fish on the waterline, gills pumping for oxygen.

Danny finishes playing.

Silence.

IMPORTANT: DANNY WILL BE KNOWN AS TOM IN THIS SCENE.

                             LIZ
                  That's so ...
                       (not finishing the word)

                             DANNY / TOM
                  Melancholy?

                             LIZ
                  Yes, it hurts my heart.  What a
                  beautiful composition.

                             DANNY/TOM
                  And the performance?






                             LIZ
                       (goofing)
                  A virtuoso rendition.  TOM VAN ALLEN
                  is nothing short of dazzling in his
                  interpretation of Miles Davis'
                  haunting, moody piece.

                             DANNY/TOM
                  Thank you.  Thank you very much.

                             LIZ
                  And he has a really hot ass with hardly
                  any hair on it.

                             DANNY/TOM
                  Again, I thank you.

                             LIZ
                  I was talking about Miles.

Danny playfully tackles her to the ground.

                             DANNY/TOM
                  You, madam, are a heartless wench.

                             LIZ
                  And you've got wiener breath.

                             DANNY/TOM
                  Really?

                             LIZ
                  It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch.

Danny starts kissing her over and over again.

                             LIZ
                       (laughing)
                  Tom! Gross!

She finally pushes him off.  He rolls off of her and snuggles up next 
to her, spooning her in the sand.

                             DANNY/TOM
                  You know how I make that song
                  melancholy when I play it?
                  I think of what my life would be like
                  without you.

Liz smiles, snuggles closer to Danny.

                             LIZ
                  Tom, let's spend the night here.

                             DANNY/TOM
                  There's no motels around here.

                             LIZ
                  No.  Right here on the beach.  Come
                  on. Let's do it.

INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Danny sitting at the vanity holding the trumpet.  THE IMAGE IS STILL 
PROJECTED ON THE WALL BEHIND HIM.
                             DANNY
                       (at the vanity, whispering)
                  Okay, we'll stay.  We'll stay.

NOW THE DANNY IN THE IMAGE ANSWERS ....

                             DANNY/TOM
                       (on the beach)
                  Come on, Liz. We'll get eaten alive.

                             DANNY
                       (at the vanity, softly)
                  No ... We'll stay.

BACK ON THE IMAGE as Danny and Liz walk away from the shore.

The sun sinks completely below the horizon.

A long fish hawk floats on the last of the thermals.

The dying fish breaths its last.

Danny (at the vanity) closes his eyes.

SERIES OF QUICK CUTS

The trumpet goes back in the case.

The lid is closed.

The case goes back in the box.

The neatly folded clothes are laid on top.

The box goes back to the shelf.

The light in the closet is turned off.

                                                          FADE OUT.

                                                          FADE IN.

EXT. DESERTED PARK - NIGHT

Danny and Tanner sitting across from one another at a picnic table.

Tanner writing serial numbers down as he counts out SEVERAL HUNDRED 
DOLLAR BILLS.

Danny watching silently.

Tanner puts the bills in an envelope, licks the flap, seals it and 
slides it over to Danny, who doesn't touch it.

The envelope lays there between them for the following conversation.

                             DANNY
                  You think I'm a Judas?

                             TANNER
                  Hard to compare the people you're
                  taking down with the Lord.

                             DANNY
                  Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.

                             TANNER
                  Garcetti thinks everything is shit.
                  He doesn't even like dolphins.

Danny smiles.

                             TANNER (cont'd)
                  I'm serious.  He hates 'em.  You ever
                  hear of anyone who didn't like dolphins?

Tanner shakes his head and smiles.


                             DANNY
                  Thanks for not judging me.

                             TANNER
                  It's not my place.

                             DANNY
                  Don't you wonder why I do it?

                             TANNER
                  The money? The drugs? Keeping yourself
                  out of jail? I know the drill.


                             DANNY
                  You don't find that repugnant?

                             TANNER
                  Just the way the world works.  Look,
                  as far as tweakers go, you aren't a
                  bad guy.  You never hurt anyone but
                  yourself as far as I know.

                             DANNY
                  Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid.

                             TANNER
                  Bobby laid his own tracks.  He could
                  have gone quietly but he played the
                  hard-ass con till the end. And as
                  far as I'm concerned, he wife and
                  kid are a hell of a lot better off
                  without him.
                       (beat)
                  Now take the money.

Danny stuffs the money into his jacket.

                             TANNER (cont'd)
                  One think I do want to know is how
                  the hell did you get yourself into
                  this position to start with?  You
                  seem like a smart enough guy.

                             DANNY
                  It's a long story.  Maybe I'll tell
                  you all about it some day.

Garcetti emerges from the men's room, zipping up.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Hey, Garcetti ... You ever get
                  confused and try to flush yourself?

                             Garcetti
                       (all business)
                  You tell him?

                             TANNER
                  I was getting to it.

                             DANNY
                       (to Tanner)
                  Tell me what?

                             GARCETTI
                  I'll tell him.


                             DANNY
                       (worried)
                  Tell me what?

Garcetti sits down next to Danny. Sighs.

                             GARCETTI
                       (mock concern)
                  Danny, it's really pains me to have to
                  tell you this, but do you remember
                  DOMINGO, that wetback you helped us
                  put away for trafficking a few months back?

                             DANNY
                  Yeah.  What about him?

                             GARCETTI
                  Turns out he's connected.

                             DANNY
                  To who?

                             GARCETTI
                  The Mexicali Boys

                             DANNY
                  And what does this have to do with me?

Garcetti puts his hand on Danny's shoulder, really playing it up.

                             GARCETTI
                  He knows somebody ratted him.

                             DANNY
                  What?!

                             GARCETTI
                  And he's making a lot of noise about
                  having his homies hang a Colombian
                  necktie on whoever it was.

Garcetti leans in close

                             GARCETTI (cont'd)
                  You know that thing where they slit
                  your throat and pull your tongue out
                  of the hole.

Danny knocks Garcetti's hand away and stands up.  Garcetti stalks him.




                             GARCETTI (cont'd)
                  Apparently they call it a necktie
                  because it hangs down about yay long
                  and looks very similar to a tie.
                  Isn't that weird, Danny?  Isn't that
                  weird?

                             DANNY
                  Shut up, Garcetti!

Danny turns to Tanner

                             DANNY
                  If he finds out it's me, I'm a dead man.

                             TANNER
                  Danny, he isn't gonna find out it's
                  you.  Domingo was a slinger, he must
                  have sold to hundreds of different people.

Danny paces back and forth.

                             TANNER (cont'd)
                  And if you're that worried about it,
                  maybe you ought to get out of town.

                             DANNY
                  How the hell am I gonna do that?  You
                  guys are still stringing me a long on
                  that possession charge.


                             GARCETTI
                       (mock surprise)
                  You mean that hasn't been cleared up yet?

Garcetti chuckles at Danny's fear

                             DANNY
                  Fuck you, Garcetti. I been at this
                  for almost a year. I've done
                  everything you guys have asked of me.

                             GARCETTI
                  Anyone ever ask you to be such a
                  disrespectful smart-ass all the time?

                             TANNER
                  Look, we'll talk to the A.D.A.

                             DANNY
                  When?

                             TANNER
                  Soon. I promise.  We'll get the
                  charges dropped and you can
                  disappear.  In the mean time, trust
                  me, he has no idea that you ratted him out.

EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

Danny sitting cross-legged in front of a gravestone.

A PICKUP TRUCK slowly winds its way up the access road towards Danny.

Danny stands up.  Dusts his pants off.

The truck stops nearby.  The strains of GARTH BROOKS from inside.

Danny approaches.  The passenger's side window rolls down revealing ...

... A BAD-ASSED ASIAN DUDE behind the wheel. He wears a cowboy hat and 
a rodeo belt.  He looks like the Chinese Marlboro man.  This is BUBBA.

An AIRBRUSH painting on the door panel - a bad likeness of Bubba 
astride a horse, dressed as a cowboy with a huge-breasted Pamela 
Anderson-type on the saddle behind him.

                             DANNY
                       (checking out the painting)
                  Ride 'em cowboy)

                             BUBBA
                       (southern twang)
                  You like that?

                             DANNY
                  Who wouldn't?

                             BUBBA
                  First rate, ain't it?

                             DANNY
                  It's downright classy is what it is.

Bubba fires up a cigarette, revealing a pock-marked face. He carries a 
gun in a tooled leather shoulder holster.
                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  You consider my presentation?

                             BUBBA
                  Get in, hoss.  We'll talk it over.

Danny climbs in.  The window goes back up.  As the care pulls away, we 
...

... MOVE back over to the gravestone.

The stone reads: "ELIZABETH VAN ALLEN.  BELOVED WIFE"

EXT. THE CINDER BLOCK BAR - NIGHT

A non-descript. cinder block bar.  No windows.  No frills.

INT. CINDER BLOCK BAR - SAME

Danny sitting at the bar, nursing a drink.  He looks nervous, eyes 
darting around for potential assassins.

He has nothing to worry about with this crowd, harmless alcoholics all.

Jimmy The Finn enters and approaches Danny.  Danny signals for Jimmy to 
go to the back, then gets up and follows him, carrying two beers.

                             DANNY
                  Jimmy, you don't look so hot.

Jimmy has dark circles under his eyes.

                             JIMMY
                  I'm hurting.

                             DANNY
                  You on a roll?

                             JIMMY
                  Was.  I'm on the fucking ghost train
                  right now, man.  You got anything for
                  me?

                             DANNY
                  Sorry.

                             JIMMY
                  Why does it have to feel so bad?

                             DANNY
                  You're brain is in reverse mode ...
                  cutting off your supply of dopamine.
                  Here.  Have a beer.

Jimmy sighs, scratches his arms.  They are all scabbed up.


                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  You see the crank bugs?





                             JIMMY
                  Oh yeah.
                       (guzzles some beer)
                  Man, Danny, how do you keep your shit
                  together so tight?

Danny chuckles.
                             DANNY
                  That's a good one.

                             JIMMY
                  I'm serious, dude.  You always seem
                  to be on top of things, even when
                  you're tweakin'.

                             DANNY
                  I guess there's just no substitute
                  for good genes.

Jimmy finishes his beer.  Danny signals to the cocktail waitress for 
more beer.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  You hear about Bobby?

                             JIMMY
                  Yeah, it's a pity.  Truly a pity.

Danny smiles at Jimmy's choice of words.

                             JIMMY (cont'd)
                  He was a good supplier.
                       (gets an idea)
                  You think maybe there's any drugs
                  left in his room?  You know, like
                  hidden?

                             DANNY
                  I kind of doubt it, Jimmy.

The beers arrive.  Jimmy lays into his, downing it in one long gulp.  
Danny slides his over.


                             JIMMY
                  So, why'd you want to see me?

                             DANNY
                  Business.  I need to leave town and I
                  find myself in dire need of some cash.

                             JIMMY
                  See that?  That's just what I'm talking about.


                             DANNY
                  What?

                             JIMMY
                  You. You're smooth. You use words like dire
                  and shit.  You got language skills, man.

                             DANNY
                  Don't get carried away.

                             JIMMY
                  I find myself in dire need of some cash.

Jimmy shakes his head in wonder.

                             DANNY
                  You remember that guy you told me
                  about ... said he could handle a big
                  hook-up?

                             JIMMY
                  Yeah, Pooh-Bear.  Dude is a big-time
                  cook. I'm talking dire.

                             DANNY
                  I know a buyer.  Guy's looking for a
                  quarter's worth.

Jimmy frowns.

                             JIMMY
                  A quarter?  Danny that ain't even worth ...

                             DANNY
                  A quarter of a million, Jimmy.

Jimmy's a drug-addled eyes catch a glimmer.

                             JIMMY
                  Fuuuuuck

                             DANNY
                  Can your man handle that?

                             JIMMY
                  I think so.  I mean, we'd have to
                  talk to him.

                             DANNY
                  Can you set that up?

                             JIMMY
                  Sure.

Jimmy sucks what's left of his beer down.

                             JIMMY (cont'd)
                  What's in it for us?

                             DANNY
                  I'm getting a 10% finder's fee from
                  my man if I can get the right price.

                             JIMMY
                  10%.  That's ...

Jimmy becomes paralyzed by the math.

                             DANNY
                  25 grand.  You introduce me to your
                  boy, I'll cut you five grand out of
                  my take.  That's all you gotta do,
                  just get me in the door.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Danny walking home.  Sparse traffic on the street. He walks with his 
head down and his hands thrust in his pockets.

A RED CAR approaches from the opposite direction. It SLOWS as it passes 
Danny.

Danny looks over.

The DRIVER is obscured by the reflected glare of a streetlight, but it 
is obvious that he is staring right at Danny.

Danny plays it cool. Keeps walking.

The red car pulls a SLOW U-TURN.

Danny hauls ass.

The red car catching up.

7Danny runs down a service street which runs through the back of a 
series of apartment complexes.

The red car follows, slowly prowling the street.

Danny squeezed behind a dumpster, watching.

It is now too dark to see the driver.  The car comes to a stop.

Danny hugging the dumpster tight.

Another car pulls into the tight street, behind the red car.  The 
driver of the other car SOUNDS HIS HORN.  The red car speeds off.

Danny walks quickly the other way.

INT. BARE APARTMENT - NIGHT

A WAY-TOO-YOUNG BLACK KID stares DIRECTLY AT CAMERA, an ARRAY OF 
HANDGUNS, KNIVES, RIFLES AND SECURITY EQUIPMENT spread out on the 
dining room table before him.

He is squeezed into a terry-cloth jumpsuit, his body festooned with 
gold jewelry, his hair all wet jerry-curl.

He looks like Barry White, Jr.
                             KID
                  Mister, I only deal in high-end

                  owners.  All sales are final and all
                  prices are negotiable.

The kid speaks in a HUSKY MONOTONE, completely FLAT and HUMORLESS.  He 
sounds like one of those kids selling candy door-to-door with a 
memorized pitch told by rote.

                             KID (cont'd)
                       (rapid fire delivery)

                       (next gun, no pause)
                  Tangfolio semi-automatic.  This a 9mm

                  grip.  Got mad-ass double action and a
                  surprising 16 round magazine.
                  Mister, I want to sell you this gun
                  and I can hook you up for the low
                  price of 200 dollars.
                       (next gun, breakneck pace)
                  Maybe you looking for something in
                  a chrome finish.  Something to
                  impress the ladies. This right here

                  semi-automatic.

                  Mister, I won't lie to you, this gun

                             KID (cont'd)
                  but it ain't all that.  That's why
                  you can walk out of here with this
                  gun for the incredible low price of
                  one hundred and "fitty" dollar.
                       (next one)
                  Maybe you looking for power, mister.
                  This gun got mad power, mad kick and
                  mad reputation.  That's right, it's
                  the Colt .357 Magnum revolver.
                  Rubber combat-style grip, fixed rear,
                  ramp front sights, 2 inch barrel.

                  action. Mister, if you're looking
                  for impact, the Magnum will satisfy
                  all of your needs.
                       (the last gun)
                  I don't know you, mister, but you
                  look like a man of style so maybe you
                  in the market for a custom piece.
                  Mister, it's your lucky day 'cause
                  this gun got style to burn.  You
                  lookin' at the Les Baer Custom

                  you with this gun, mister.  And I can
                  give it to you for the low price of
                  seven hundred and ninety-five
                  dollars.  Mister, these are my guns.
                  All sales are final, and all prices
                  are negotiable.

He finishes .... staring at ...

Danny and Jimmy, standing there, wide-eyed and amazed by the incredible 
sales pitch.

EXT. BAD NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

Rows of decaying stucco apartment buildings.  Danny and Jimmy walking 
away from one of the structures.

Danny pockets the GLOCK he just purchased.  He also carries a BULLET-
PROOF VEST over this shoulder.

                             DANNY
                  Jimmy, where do you find these people?

                             JIMMY
                  The Del Ammo Mall mostly.

They walk along.

                             JIMMY
                  You wanna score some go-fast?

                             DANNY
                  Not tonight.

They continue on. Jimmy looks at the vest.

                             JIMMY
                  Hey, why do you need a gun and a vest anyway?

                             DANNY
                  Personal protection. It's a
                  dangerous world we live in, Jimmy, a
                  very dangerous world.

INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL - NIGHT

A TRASHY LOOKING DUDE banging on Colette's door.

Danny at his door, fumbling with his keys, watching the dude.

                             DUDE
                       (sees Danny eyeballing him)
                  You mad dogging me, Bitch?

                             DANNY
                  Heavens no. I was just admiring your boots.

The dude looks down at this beat-up motorcycle boots.

                             DANNY
                  Did you purchase them locally?

The dude ignores Danny and keeps pounding on the door.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Goodbye now. Nice meeting you.

INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Danny enters.  AN ARGUMENT ENSUES NEXT DOOR between the dude and 
Colette.

The sounds of a struggle.  Colette screams.  The dude yelling at the 
top of his lungs.  A LOUD SMACK. SILENCE.

Colette sobbing. The dude talking in hushed tones, contrite.

EXT. FREEWAY - DAY

A spray painted rusty Chevy Vega belching black smoke.  All of the 
lights are broken.

INT. VERA - SAME

Jimmy driving.  Danny in the passenger's seat, looking down at ...

... the floorboard, or lack thereof.  It is completely rusted out.  The 
freeway rushes by underneath.

                             DANNY
                  You know, Jimmy, you might as well
                  put a sign on the back of this thing
                  asking the cops to pull you over.

                             JIMMY
                  You mean, like to throw 'em off?

                             DANNY
                  Yeah, that's what I mean.
                       (beat)
                  Where the hell does this guy live anyway?

                             JIMMY
                  Palmdale

                             DANNY
                  Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?

                             JIMMY
                  I think on account of his nose.

                             DANNY
                  You're going to have to explain that
                  one.

                             JIMMY
                  He doesn't have one.

                             DANNY
                  You're going to have to give me a little
                  more than that, Jimmy.


                             JIMMY
                  Well, you know how Winnie the Pooh
                  always got his nose stuck in the honey jar?
                  Well, Pooh-Bear snorted so much
                  crank, they had to cut his nose off.
                  He's got a plastic one though.

Danny wonders what he's getting himself into.

                             JIMMY (cont'd)
                  You know, they say he hasn't slept in
                  over a year.

                             DANNY
                  You ever see Queen Elizabeth sleep?

                             JIMMY
                  No
                       (beat)
                  You think she's a tweaker?

EXT. POOH-BEAR'S COMPOUND - DAY

A sprawling old ranch house tucked into the remote hills of the desert.

A GUY passes out in the front yard.  A DOG sniffs at him, then starts 
pissing on him.  He never moves.

A PILE OF DEAD PIGEONS near the driveway.

CLOSE ON POOH-BEAR - he does indeed have a prosthetic nose.  It almost 
blends in with his face but not quite, making it that much more 
disconcerting.

He takes a huge hit of crystal meth from a pipe, holds it, then blows a 
long exhale.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Okay, here we go gentlemen ...

A REMOTE CONTROLLED CAR trundles out of the garage and along the 
driveway. Inside the car, FOUR PIEGEONS, their bodies wrapped in tape.

Pooh-Bear working the remote control device.

                             POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
                  Zapruder?

A GUY filming the whole thing with a super-8 camera.

GRAINY SUPER 8 FOOTAGE: the pigeons continue along, their stupid eyes 
glazed with confusion.


                             ZAPRUDER
                  Ready.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Oswald?

ANOTHER GUY sighting a scoped pellet gun.

                             OSWALD
                  Roger that.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Grassy knoll?

A THIRD GUY aiming a pellet gun further down and to the right of 
"Oswald".

                             GRASSY KNOLL
                  Ready

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Third shooter?

THE THIRD SHOOTER is also armed with a pellet gun


THIRD SHOOTER
It's a go.

Pooh-Bear watches anxiously.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  President Kennedy waving to the
                  crowd, his lovely wife looking
                  radiant beside him as they turn into
                  Dealey Plaza ...

GRAINY FOOTAGE: the car making a turn, the pigeons oblivious.

                             POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
                  Stand by, gentlemen.  Stand by ...
                       (beat, eyes widening)
                  Steady .... steady ... FIRE!

The three men open up simultaneously.

GRAINY FOOTAGE: a mass of feathers flying as the pigeons are hit.

Pooh-Bear pumps his fist.

                             POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
                  Yes!  Yes!
                       (beat)
                  Out! That's a wrap.  Good job, boys. Good job.

The car continues rolling past the feet of ...

... Danny and Jimmy, who have been watching the whole thing from the 
periphery

                             POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
                       (to Danny and Jimmy)
                  So? What do you think?

                             DANNY/JIMMY
                       (ad-libbing)
                  - Cool.
                  - Yeah. Interesting.

Pooh-Bear takes the camera from "Zapruder".

                             POOH-BEAR
                       (holding up the camera)
                  I'm gonna get this developed and send
                  it to the Warren Commission.

                             DANNY
                  Um, I think the Warren Commission has
                  been closed for a while.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  No shit?
                       (thinking)
                  Fuck it.  I'll send it to Oliver Stone then.
                  He'll get them to reopen the bastard.

                             OSWALD (O.S.)
                  Pooh-Bear! We got a problem.

Oswald is standing over the car, prodding one of the pigeons with his 
pellet gun.

                             OSWALD (cont'd)
                  J.F.K.'s still alive.
                       (beat)
                  Should I finish him off?

INT. POOH-BEARS HOUSE - DAY

Pooh-Bear and Danny alone in the kitchen.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  So, Danny, Jimmy tells me you have a
                  proposition for me.

Pooh-Bear picks at a plate of SCRAMBLED EGGS on his lap.



                             DANNY
                  Yeah, I uh, have a buyer who's
                  looking for about a quarter's worth.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Crank or glass?

                             DANNY
                  The good stuff.  Can you handle that?

Pooh-Bear chews his food and nods.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  I'm sorry.  Would you like a taste?

                             DANNY
                  No, I'm good.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  I insist. It's delicious. Just a taste.

Not wanting to offend him, Danny concedes.  Pooh-Bear shovels some eggs 
into Danny's mouth.
                             DANNY
                  Not bad.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Secret recipe.

Pooh-Bear winks and shovels some more down.

                             DANNY
                  Can we talk price?

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Make me an offer.

                             DANNY
                  I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?

                             POOH-BEAR
                  I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None
                  of that faggot metric crap for me.

                             DANNY
                  Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.

                             POOH-BEAR
                       (enthusiastic)
                  Hey, okay.

Danny looks surprised. It was too easy.

                             DANNY
                  You're serious?

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Anything for a dear friend.

                             DANNY
                  But I just met you.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  But you're a friend of Jimmy's. I
                  think of you as a brother already.

Pooh-Bear takes another bite of eggs.

                             DANNY
                  So that's 40 lbs. at 6 a pound then?

                             POOH-BEAR
                  If you say so.

                             DANNY
                  Pooh-Bear, I don't mean to be rude,
                  but I get the feeling you aren't
                  taking me seriously.

Pooh-Bear puts the plate down.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Maybe you're the one who isn't taking
                  me seriously.

                             DANNY
                  Why do you say that?

                             POOH-BEAR
                  I welcome you here with open arms and
                  you got the nerve to low-ball me like
                  some slick used car salesman.

                             DANNY
                  Hey, I was just trying to ...

                             POOH-BEAR
                       (never losing his smile)
                  I want to tell you about the last guy
                  who tried to jam me up on a deal.

                             DANNY
                  Hey, I don't play that.



                             POOH-BEAR
                  I'm sure you don't.  At least I'm
                  sure you think you don't.  Anyway, I
                  want to tell you. It's a good story,
                  guaranteed to break the ice at a party.

Pooh-Bear leans back, grinning broadly

                             POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
                  Dude shorted me eleven dollar ...
                  thought I wouldn't count it till I
                  got home.  Wrong.
                       (beat)
                  You know what I did?
                       (beat)
                  I clamped his head in a vice.

QUICK FLASH BACK: LOW ANGLE SLOW-MOTION CLOSE-UP of Pooh-Bear staring 
down at something OFFSCREEN, a menacing look on his face.

                             POOH-BEAR (V.O.)
                  You should have heard him howling.

BACK TO PRESENT: Pooh-Bear lights a cigarette

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Then I took a Saws All and I cut
                  His skull open

QUICK FLASH: CONTINUE SLOW MOTION CLOSE UP. Pooh-Bear reaching for 
something OFFSCREEN.
                             POOH-BEAR (V.O.)
                       (calmly)
                  You know, those Saws All really do
                  cut through everything.

BACK TO PRESENT: Danny getting nervous.

                             DANNY
                  Look, you don't have to ...

                             POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
                  So I'm standing there looking at this
                  dude's brain and I'm thinking to
                  myself, you know, this guy doesn't
                  really need this thing. I mean,
                  anyone stupid enough to jam me up
                  doesn't really use their brain to
                  begin with. You know what I'm
                  saying?
                       (beat, dead serious)
                  So I took it.

Pooh-Bear makes a POPPING SOUND as he illustrates with his hands.

QUICK FLASH BACK: Pooh-Bear looking down at SOMETHING in his hand, his 
face blossoming into a sick smile.

BACK TO PRESENT: Danny listens somberly.

                             POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
                  Hell, I make better use out of it
                  than he ever did.  Got it up in my
                  freezer. I take it out from time-to-
                  time, mix a little of it up in my
                  dinner ....
                       (looks at the plate of eggs)
                  ... of breakfast.

ON THE PLATE - little chunks of gray matter mixed in with the eggs.

Pooh-Bear smiles knowingly.  Danny turns pale.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  10,000 a pound

Danny decides to nerve it out

                             DANNY
                  Now you're insulting me.  Nice
                  talking business with you.

Danny gets up to leave. One of his hands shaking uncontrollably. He 
steadies it with the other hand.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  9,000.  Take it or leave it.

Danny stops.

                             DANNY
                  I'll leave it.  Eight is as high as
                  I'll go.  See ya'.

Danny goes to leave again.




                             POOH-BEAR
                  All right, all right. Don't get your
                  knickers in a knot. I can live with eight.

Pooh-Bear stands up.


                             POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
                  You got a deal.

They shake hands.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  God damn, Danny, you got some nerve.
                  Pooh-Bear respects that.
                       (beat)
                  Oh, by the way ...

Pooh-Bear takes something from the kitchen counter and tosses it on the 
table ...

... a store-bought package of COW BRAINS.

QUICK FLASH BACK: REVEAL that Pooh-Bear has been standing at the meat 
section in a GROCERY STORE. He is looking down at the package of COW 
BRAINS in his hand.

                             POOH-BEAR
                       (in the grocery store)
                  Hmm. Good price.

Pooh-Bear tosses the package in his cart and walks away, whistling.

BACK TO PRESENT:

                             POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
                  You want to stay for lunch?

Danny has been had.  Pooh-Bear laughs uproariously.

INT. VEGA - DAY

Danny slouched in the passenger's seat.

Jimmy holds out a bullet dispenser of crank.

                             JIMMY
                  You want a hit?

                             DANNY
                  No. I'm good.

Jimmy pockets the drugs.

                             JIMMY
                  Can I ask you something?

                             DANNY
                  Sure, Jimmy.

                             JIMMY
                  What does J.F.K. stand for?

                             DANNY
                  John Fitzgerald Kennedy.

                             JIMMY
                  Was he the president?

                             DANNY
                  Yes, Jimmy

Jimmy drives for a while, then ...

                             JIMMY
                  Danny?

                             DANNY
                  Yes, Jimmy.

                             JIMMY
                  Thanks for not laughing at me.

INT. CINDER BLOCK BAR - NIGHT

A DAPPER OLD MAN in a wheelchair crooning a Muzak-like version of Lou 
Reed's WALK ON THE WILD SIDE on a cheapo Karaoke set-up in the back of 
the bar.

                             OLD MAN
                       (softly, a la Perry Como)
                  Sugar Plum Fairy never once gave it away.
                  Everybody had to pay and pay ...

Danny, Jimmy, Kujo and Creeper sitting in a booth.

Jimmy and Creeper are amped, jaws grinding, eyes bugging.

Kujo rambles on but Danny isn't listening. He looks exhausted, his face 
is pinched, there are bags under his eyes.  He scans the bar, stopping 
on ...

... Colette AND HER TRASHY DUDE BOYFRIEND

Colette sees Danny looking.  Smiles at him.  Danny returns the smile 
until the trashy dude looks over.  Danny looks away.

                             KUJO
                  Danny, listen up.  Here's the deal ...
                  my wife's pimp knows a guy who works
                  at Cedars Sinai medical lab.  They're
                  getting a very special delivery a
                  week from this Friday.

                             JIMMY
                  What is it, drugs?

                             KUJO
                  Better than drugs.

Kujo leans in and lowers his voice

                             KUJO
                  Bob Hope's stool specimen
                       (beat)
                  We're gonna boost it.


                             DANNY
                  Why in God's name would we want
                  to do that?

                             KUJO
                  So we can sell it.

                             DANNY
                  To who?

                             KUJO
                  I don't know.  A collector.  Fuck
                  Danny, it's Bob Hope.

                             CREEPER
                  He is a national treasure.

Danny shakes his head in amazement, then looks back at Colette again.  
She sneaks another look at him.

ON THE TABLE - Kujo slides a drink glass in front of him.

                             KUJO
                  Check it out.  This is the lab.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY (FLASH FORWARD)

A stark hospital hallway. A placard on one of the doors - MEDICAL LAB.

A TITLE APPEARS - "KUJO'S BIG HEIST"

INT. CINDER BLOCK BAR - NIGHT

Creeper points at the glass.

                             CREEPER
                  What is that?

                             KUJO
                  It's the lab.


                             CREEPER
                  I mean what kind of drink?

                             KUJO
                  Cuba Libre

                             JIMMY
                  What is that? Rum and coke?

                             KUJO
                  Don't worry about it.

                             JIMMY
                  I just want to be straight on the
                  details.  Can I taste it?

                             KUJO
                  No, you can't taste it.  It's the fucking
                  lab! Now shut up.

Danny amused by the conversation.  He sees something out of the corner 
of his eye ...

The boyfriend kissing Colette roughly.  She obviously isn't enjoying 
it.

Danny watching intently.

                             KUJO (cont'd)
                  Danny, come on. If I'm gonna let you
                  in on the opportunity of a lifetime,
                  the least you can do is pay
                  attention.

Danny turns back to the table. Kujo slides another glass over.

                             KUJO (cont'd)
                  This is the courier

                             CREEPER
                  You should use something smaller.
                  He's the same size as the office. It
                  doesn't ring true.

Kujo rolls his eyes.  He uses a peanut instead.

                             OLD MAN (O.S.)
                  And the colored girls sing doot-de-doot ....

INT. HALLWAY - DAY (FLASH FORWARD)

A courier exits from the elevator carrying a medical sample case.



                             KUJO (O.S.)
                  He delivers at four o'clock on the
                  nose every Friday.  Alpha team will
                  be in the elevator with the courier.
                  That'll be Danny and Creeper.

MOVE INTO THE ELEVATOR - Creeper standing in the corner alone, asleep 
on his feet, drool trickling down his mouth.

                             KUJO (cont'd)
                  Every member of the team will be
                  equipped with night vision goggles, a
                  police scanner and two-way radios.

The elevator door closes on the dosing Creeper.

INT. CINDER BLOCK BAR - NIGHT

He slides over two peanuts behind the courier peanut.

                             KUJO (cont'd)
                  ... number two team, which will be
                  me and Jimmy, will be positioned in
                  the stairwell at the other end of the hall.

Kujo slides over two more peanuts.

The trashy dude heads into the bathroom.  Danny sneaks another look at 
Colette.  This time, she gives him a big smile.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY (FLASH FORWARD)

Kujo emerges from the stairwell, also alone, approaching the courier.

He is wearing shorts, a tank top and after-ski boots.  He has a big 
powdery crank donut around his nostrils.
                             KUJO (cont'd)
                  With alpha team following from the
                  elevator, number two team will
                  approach from the stairwell, cutting
                  the courier off before he reaches the lab.

Creeper still fast asleep inside the elevator.   He wakes with a start, 
breaking down into a karate stance.

INT. CINDER BLOCK BAR - NIGHT

The courier peanut is now surrounded by the other peanuts and the 
cashew.

                             KUJO (cont'd)
                  Facing superior numbers and an array of high-tech weapons, 
                  the courier will have no choice but to comply with our demands.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY (FLASH FORWARD)

Kujo and the courier playing tug-of-war with the case.  Kujo points a 
dustbuster vacuum at the courier like it was a gun.

INT. CINDER BLOCK BAR - NIGHT

Jimmy listening intently, takes some of the peanuts.

                             KUJO
                  Jesus Jimmy, you at the alpha team.

                             JIMMY
                  I thought you were done.

Jimmy pulls peanut paste from his mouth and mounds them up on the 
table.

                             OLD MAN
                  I said hey sugar, take a walk on the wild side ...

                             KUJO (cont'd)
                  Now here's the beautiful part.  The
                  getaway.  Both teams will rappel
                  right down the center of the
                  stairwell, change clothes and walk
                  right out the front door like nothing
                  happened.

INT. HOSPITAL - DAY (FLASH FORWARD)

Kujo tumbling head-over-heals down the metal steps.  He gets to his 
feet, a bloody mess.

The kit has sprung open, sending shit samples everywhere.

Kujo quickly scrapes as much as he can back into a container and runs 
off.

EXT. CEDARS SINAI - DAY (FLASH FORWARD)

Kujo bolts out the front door, into the street and directly into the 
path of ...

... an ONCOMING AMBULANCE, which drags him underneath for a good fifty 
feet.

INT. CINDER BLOCK BAR - NIGHT

Danny watches as the trashy dude exits the bathroom.

                             KUJO
                  So what's it gonna be, Danny boy?
                  You in or out?

Trashy dude goes to Colette.  It looks like he wants to leave and she 
doesn't.


                             KUJO (cont'd)
                  Danny!

Trashy dude grabs her by the back of the neck, lifts her off the stool 
and pushes her out the front door.

                             DANNY
                       (watching Colette)
                  I'm afraid I'm gonna have to pass on
                  this one, boys.

Danny watches her exit.

INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL - NIGHT (LATER)

Danny approaches his door. Stops. 

Colette is sitting in the hall, head in hands, sobbing. 

Danny starts to say something. Stops. Goes to this door. Stops again. 

                             DANNY
                  You okay?
                  She nods. 

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Well...good night then.

Danny starts to enter again. Stops again. 

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Why are you out here?

                             COLETTE
                  Quincey, my boyfriend... he kicked me out.

Danny isn't quite sure what to do. He takes a half-step towards her. 

                             DANNY
                  Look...I'd like to help you out ... but I
                  really don't want to get involved.

                             COLETTE
                  I understand. Thanks anyway.

She looks up. That face. Those eyes. Everything about her says "Get 
involved."

INT. COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT

Danny and Colette in a near-deserted retro coffee shop.

A LONE WAITRESS AND COOK mull behind the counter.

Colette's mascara is running.  Danny hands her a napkin.

                             COLETTE
                  Thanks.

She dabs at her eyes.

                             COLETTE (cont'd)
                  I'm so embarrassed.

                             DANNY
                  Don't be.

She looks at herself in a compact mirror.

                             COLETTE
                  Jesus, I look like a raccoon.

                             DANNY
                  I was thinking Alice Cooper.

She puts her head in her hands.  Sighs.

                             COLETTE
                  Oh God.

                             DANNY
                  Come on, cheer up. It could be worse.

She looks up.

                             COLETTE
                  How?

                             DANNY
                  I don't know .... you could be staking
                  your financial future on stealing Bob
                  Hope's stool specimen.

She laughs

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  See. No matter how bad things are,
                  there's always someone a little worse off.

                             COLETTE
                  What about the guy on the very bottom?

                             DANNY
                  Leave me out of this.

                             COLETTE
                  That bad, huh?

Danny holds up his water glass.

                             DANNY
                  Nevertheless, I still try to see
                  the glass as half-full.

He takes a sip.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Problem is, it's usually half-full of
                  something that tastes a  lot like urine.

He pulls a face.  Sets the glass down.

                             COLETTE
                  Could be worse.
                       (beat)
                  Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to.

                             DANNY
                  Ouch.

Colette sips her coffee.   Danny looks around nervously.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Hey, did I mention that I was a coward?

Colette frowns, not sure what he means.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Quincey. You sure he isn't gonna
                  come looking for you?

                             COLETTE
                  Don't worry, he's probably passed out
                  with his head in the toilet by now.

                             DANNY
                  This man sounds like a real catch.

                             COLETTE
                  Oh, he's a keeper all right.

                             DANNY
                  Colette ...

He stops.
                             COLETTE
                  What?

                             DANNY
                  Nothing.

                             COLETTE
                  Go ahead.

                             DANNY
                  Look, it's really none of my business
                  but why don't you just dump this guy?

                             COLETTE
                  It's not that easy.

                             DANNY
                  Don't tell me, down deep he's really
                  not a bad person and you don't want
                  to see him get hurt.

                             COLETTE
                  Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce
                  Brothers?
                       (beat)
                  I hate the son-of-a-bitch.

                             DANNY
                  Then leave.

                             COLETTE
                  I can't.

                             DANNY
                  Why not?

                             COLETTE
                  You don't understand.

                             DANNY
                  There's nothing to understand.  
                  The guy is a pig.

                             COLETTE
                  I can't leave.

                             DANNY
                  You get off on abuse or
                  something?

                             COLETTE
                  Fuck you.

                             DANNY
                  Then why don't you leave?
                       (beat)
                  Just give me one good reason.

                             COLETTE
                  Because he'll kill me.

The waitress and cook look up.

                             COLETTE (cont'd)
                  Is that simple enough for you?

                             DANNY
                  Why don't you call the cops?

                             COLETTE
                  Why? They don't hold him for more
                  than a day or two.

                             DANNY
                  That's long enough to get out of town.

                             COLETTE
                  I can't. I've got a kid.  She lives
                  with my parents.  Quincey knows where
                  they live.

Danny chews it over for a second then ...

                             DANNY
                  Then make sure he gets put away for longer.

                             COLETTE
                  How?

Danny hesitates, not sure of how much he wants to get involved.

                             COLETTE (cont'd)
                  Tell me how.

                             DANNY
                  I don't know.
                       (beat)
                  Let me think about it.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Urban blight abounds

INT. BURNED OUT BUILDING - NIGHT

The grafitti-filled, cluttered shell of what used to be some sort of 
offices.

BUBBA THE ASIAN COWBOY sitting on a desk. Danny pacing back and forth 
in front of him.



                             BUBBA
                       (Texas drawl)
                  I wanna do a small buy first.  Ten
                  thousand.  We'll see how it goes.

                             DANNY
                  Why? The guys is ready to deal now.

                             BUBBA
                  Because I don't know him and I don't
                  really know you, partner.

                             DANNY
                  Now that's down-right insulting.

                             BUBBA
                  I'll have to live with that.  My money
                  my risk, my rules.

Bubba takes a plastic-wrapped bundle of money from his pocket.  Tosses 
it on the table.

EXT. ALLEY - SAME

Tanner and Garcetti ensconced in an alley diagonally across the street.

Garcetti pointing a LONG-RANGE PARABOLIC MICROPHONE at the burned out 
building.  He and Tanner wear earpieces, which are attached to the 
mike.

                             DANNY (O.S.)
                       (filtered, broken)
                  I guess I don't have a hell of a lot
                  of choice.

                             BUBBA (O.S.)
                       (filtered)
                  Get used to it.  You're in a very
                  tenuous position on the food chain, hoss.

Garcetti removes his earpiece and turns to Tanner.

                             GARCETTI
                  You thinking what I'm thinking?

                             TANNER
                  Yeah.  This could be the one we're
                  looking for.

EXT. BURNED OUT BUILDING - SAME

Bubba exits the building and disappears around the corner.

INT. BURNED OUT BUILDING - SAME

Danny now alone. He picks up the bundle of cash.  Turns to leave when 
...

... Tanner and Garcetti enter the building.  Danny turns and runs the 
other way.

                             TANNER
                  Hold it right there, Flynne.

Danny stops.

                             DANNY
                  Jesus, you almost gave me a heart attack!

Danny secretly pockets the bundle of cash.

                             DANNY
                  What the hell are you doing here?

                             TANNER
                  Question is, what are you doing here?

                             DANNY
                  I was trying to score some dope.

                             TANNER
                  Cut the shit, Flynne.

                             DANNY
                  Someone want to tell me what the hell
                  is going on here?

                             TANNER
                  Okay, asshole, you wanna play, we'll play.

Tanner takes out a pair of black leather gloves.

                             DANNY
                       (serious)
                  What did I do?!

Tanner approaches him.  Danny backs into a corner.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  This is a joke, right?  You put him
                  up to this, Garcetti?

Garcetti is mum.  Tanner raises his fists.  Danny covers his face.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Come on Tanner ... don't ...

Tanner starts swinging but SOMETHING UNEXPECTED ...

TANNER HITS LIKE A WIMP.

The punches have absolutely no effect.

Danny can't help it.  HE STARTS LAUGHING.  Tanner throws some more 
creampuffs.

Garcetti shakes his head with shame.

                             TANNER
                       (shrieking, failing)
                  You think this is funny motherfucker?

                             DANNY
                       (still laughing and covering up)
                  I can't help it, Tanner, you hit like
                  a fucking girl.

This makes Tanner even madder. His punches become wilder and even less 
effective.

                             DANNY
                  Garcetti, do something.

Garcetti tires of the whole show.  He pulls a small SHOCK GUN from his 
pocket, switches it on and sticks Danny behind the neck with it.

Danny crumples to the floor.  Tanner kicks him in the face.

Garecetti squats down next to Danny.

                             GARCETTI
                  We know what's going on.

                             DANNY
                       (in pain)
                  I still don't know what you're
                  talking about.

Garcetti jams the stun-gun into Danny's crotch.  DANNY HOWLS.  Garcetti 
lays off.  Danny lays there whimpering.

                             GARCETTI
                  Okay, let me help you.  You're setting
                  up a deal with a Chinese redneck.
                  Quarter of a million.

Garcetti holds up a tap.

                             GARCETTI (cont'd)
                  We just listened to the whole thing.

Danny gaped-mouthed. He can't believe it.

                             GARCETTI (cont'd)
                  Somebody tipped up, dipshit.

                             DANNY
                  Jimmy?

                             GARCETTI
                  Who the hell is Jimmy?

                             DANNY
                  He's the only one I told.

                             GARCETTI
                  And he probably only told two people
                  and they probably only told four
                  people and on and one. You know
                  better than to tell a secret to a
                  tweaker, Flynne.  Might just as well
                  broadcast it on the evening news.

INT. BURNED OUT BUILDING - NIGHT (LATER)

Danny sitting on a crate. He is sporting a BLACK EYE from where Tanner 
kicked him.

Garcetti at the desk dusting the plastic wrapper on the bundle of cash 
for prints.  Tanner paces back and forth in front of Danny.

                             DANNY
                  I met the guy at a party.  He said he
                  wanted to do a biggie. He's new in
                  town so I offered my services.

                             TANNER
                  This chink have a name?

                             DANNY
                  Bubba.

Tanner rolls his eyes.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  I swear. That's all he gave me.
                  Hell, I didn't give him my real name either
                       (off their skeptical looks)
                  He figured the less we know about
                  each other, the better.

                             TANNER
                  You better not be blowing smoke up
                  My ass, Flynne.

                             DANNY
                  After that ass-whipping you gave me?

Garcetti suppresses a smile.

                             GARCETTI
                       (finishing up with the bundle)
                  What's on the other end of this thing?

                             DANNY
                  Now that I can help you with. Nasty
                  boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear.
                  He's a chef.
                  Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure
                  they're keeping box scores on the guy.

                             GARCETTI
                  Sounds like you hooked up with some
                  fine citizens, Flynne.

                             DANNY
                  Oh they're all that and the
                  proverbial bag of chips.

                             TANNER
                  What're your taking down?

                             DANNY
                  Standard vig.  Minus five for a
                  certain blabber-mouth moron by the
                  name of Jimmy the Finn, who's living
                  proof that natural selection is a
                  flawed theory.

Tanner looks at Danny quizzically.

                             TANNER
                  Did you really think you were slick
                  enough to pull this off?

                             DANNY
                  Look man, I just wanted to make some
                  dough and disappear.  I didn't want
                  to wait around for Domingo to figure
                  out who doubled back on him.

Danny holds his hands up

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  But now I've seen the error of my
                  ways.  I'll just walk away ... call
                  the whole deal off.

                             GARCETTI
                  Wrong.

He tosses the bundle of cash to Danny.

                             DANNY
                  You mean you want me to roll on these guys?

Their silence is answer enough.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  No. No way.  These guys catch a
                  whiff and I'm a fucking bag of Bandini.

                             TANNER
                  You've got no choice.

                             DANNY
                  Whata you mean I've got no choice?

                             TANNER
                  Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in
                  la casa grande ...

                             DANNY
                  For that old possession charge?
                  Gimme a break.

                             TANNER
                  No. You just handed us a new one.  We
                  can go Federal on your ass right now:
                  ongoing criminal conspiracy. Intent
                  to buy and distribute $250,000 worth
                  of crank.  What's the mandatory on
                  that, Al?

                             GARCETTI
                  Dime, minimum.

MOVE OFF GARCETTI and over to a wall mounted heating vent.  MOVE INTO 
THE VENT, then ...

... OUT OF A VENT in another room.

BUBBA lurking in the shadows. Listening to the conversation through the 
wall vent in the other room.

                             TANNER (O.S.)
                  And believe me, word will get out that
                  you're a pro rat.

                             GARCETTI (O.S.)
                  That's not good in prison. It's just
                  not good.

Bubba listens intently.


INT. CAR - NIGHT

Danny hunkered down in the back sea.  Garcetti sniffing the air.

                             GARCETTI
                  What's that smell?

                             DANNY
                  That would be me.

                             GARCETTI
                  What'd you do, piss your pants?

                             DANNY
                  Hell, yes!  What the hell do you expect
                  zapping Mr. Johnson with that crackler?

Garcetti looks back at Danny with a twisted smile.

                             GARCETTI
                  Who'd have thought it?  Danny
                  "Chickenshit" Flynne trying to go
                  large right under our noses.

                             DANNY
                  Lay off, Garcetti.  I'm not in the mood.

                             GARCETTI
                  No.  You've got me all wrong.  I
                  mean, in you own pussified way, you
                  actually got some nuts in your little sack.

                             TANNER
                  Bullshit. He's a liar.

                             DANNY
                  News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.

                             TANNER
                  You think you're so god damned smart,
                  don't you?

The dynamic has suddenly changed in the trio's relationship.  Tanner is 
now the bad cop.

                             TANNER (cont'd)
                  Well, you played the wrong mark this
                  time, asshole.

EXT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL - NIGHT

Danny approaching the building, we hear shots ...

... THE RED CAR from earlier, prowling the streets.  Danny ducks into a 
liquor store and watches from the window.

The red car cruises slowly past.

Danny squinting, trying to make out ...

... THE LICENSE PLATE NUMBER.  A street light illuminates the tag 
momentarily.  A VANITY PLATE: IFORGIV.

Danny frowns, not sure that to make of it.

INT. COLETTE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Colette and Quincey lying in bed.  THE LILTING SOUND of Danny's trumpet 
wafting in the air.

Quincey is fast asleep.  Colette lays there, eyes open, listening to 
the coolly hypnotic strains of Miles Davis' "Generique."

INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - SAME

Danny in his good clothes, sitting in front of the mirror, playing his 
trumpet, staring at the photos of his wife.

INT. COLETTE'S ROOM - SAME

Colette now sitting on the floor of the adjoining wall with her arms 
around her knees.  She closes her eyes and leans her head against the 
wall, soaking in the music.

INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - SAME

Danny continues playing.  He sneaks down a look at ...

... A GREETING CARD on the vanity in front of him.  The word, 
"CONGRATULATIONS" printed on the front.

THE FLASHBACK IMGERY appears on the wall behind him again.  MOVE from 
Danny to the image as we ...

                                                      CUT TO:

EXT. DIRT ROAD - THE HIGH DESERT (FLASHBACK)

The car jolting slowly back and forth over the bumpy road.

INT. CAR - SAME

Danny driving. Liz in the passenger seat looking pissed.

The Salton Sea can be seen far below in the distance shimmering under a 
full moon.

AGAIN.  REMEMBER, DANNY IS KNOWN AS TOM IN THIS SCENE.

                             LIZ
                  Why didn't you just ask for
                  directions back there?

                             DANNY/TOM
                  Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?

                             LIZ
                  You mean like the Donner Party?

                             DANNY/TOM
                  Hey, do you think you could eat me if
                  you had to?  And if so, which part do
                  you think you would find the most
                  delicious?

                             LIZ
                  Tom, quit fucking around.

                             DANNY/TOM
                  Okay, okay.
                       (peering through the windshield)
                  There's a house up there. I'll go ask
                  for directions.

EXT. ROAD - SAME

A dilapidated house further up in the hills, lights glowing.

INT. CAR - SAME

Liz sees the run-down old house.

                             LIZ
                  You think that's a good idea?

                             DANNY/TOM
                  What do you mean?

                             LIZ
                  Look at that place. It's creepy.

Danny steers the car onto the narrow dirt approach to the house.

                             DANNY/TOM
                  First you want me to ask for
                  directions, then you don't.  Which is it?

                             LIZ
                  I wanted you to ask back there.  You
                  know, before you got us lost.

                             DANNY/TOM
                  Just no pleasing you, is there?

                             LIZ
                  Just admit you're wrong.

                             DANNY/TOM
                  We all know how much you like hearing
                  that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong.
                  There.  You happy?

                             LIZ
                  Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom.
                  It gets old.

                             DANNY/TOM
                  No. You know what gets old? Being
                  reminded what a loser you are every
                  time you screw up.

                             LIZ
                  Here it comes, poor Tom.

                             DANNY/TOM
                  But that's okay, Liz, you're the one
                  with the steady job, you pay all the
                  bills. I'm just an unemployed
                  musician.  You have every right.

                             LIZ
                  That is so unfair.

Danny stares straight ahead, steering the car towards the house.

                             DANNY/TOM
                  My sentiments exactly.

                             LIZ
                  Why are you doing this?

Danny doesn't answer.

                             LIZ (cont'd)
                  I never once asked you to stop
                  playing. I wouldn't dream of it. So
                  don't take your low self-esteem out
                  on me.

Danny continues to ignore her.

                             LIZ
                  ... Tom ... screw it.  Tell me when you're
                  ready to apologize.

INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

DANNY lying on the bed, reliving the moment.  THE IMAGE STILL PROJECTED 
ON THE WALL.
                             DANNY
                       (on the bed, whispering)
                  I'm sorry, Liz. I love you and I'm sorry.

But the DANNY IN THE IMAGE never answers.

INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - DAY

It is raining buckets outside.  Danny sleeping soundly.

The roof of Danny's room is leaking, PUDDLING UP ON THE FLOOR NEAR HIS 
BED.

Danny's eyes pop open. He lays there rigidly.  LISTENING TO THE WATER.

ALL OTHER SOUND FADES OUT AS THE WATER PATTERS AND PUDDLE ON THE FLOOR.  
IT IS UNNATURALLY LOUD.

INT. CINDER BLOCK BAR - NIGHT

The bar is almost empty.

Danny quietly playing chords on a beat-up old upright piano in the back 
of the room - the through-line of Davis' "All Blues." 

                             COLETTE (O.S.)
                  This seat taken?

Danny looks up. 

                             DANNY
                  Oh. Hi.

                             COLETTE
                  What happened to your eye?

                             DANNY
                  Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.
                       (beat)
                  By the way, I'm not looking for a
                  matching set.
                       (off her puzzled look)
                  Where's Quincey?

                             COLETTE
                  Don't worry. He's out of town.

                             DANNY
                  How far out of town?

                             COLETTE
                  Trust me. We're safe.

Colette sits down on the piano bench next to Danny. 

                             COLETTE (cont'd)
                  Please keep playing.

He continues. She sits there listening for a few moments. 

                             COLETTE (cont'd)
                  That's nice. What is it?

                             DANNY
                  Miles Davis. "All Blues."

                             COLETTE
                  Never heard of him.

                             DANNY
                  Just a fucked-up guy who played
                  beautiful music.

                             COLETTE
                  Like you?

                             DANNY
                  Nah. I'm strictly minor league...
                  except for the fucked-up part.

Danny continues to play. 

                             DANNY
                  Dude played his soul right out the
                  end of the horn. No false notes.
                  Always honest.

                             COLETTE
                  And you admire that?

                             DANNY
                  It's the only way to play.

Colette slides closer. 

                             COLETTE
                  Is that how you play?

                             DANNY
                  I try.


                             COLETTE
                  No false notes?

She pulls even closer. 

                             COLETTE
                  No deep dark secrets?

She goes to kiss him. Danny stops playing. Pulls away from her. 

                             DANNY
                       (cold and abrupt):
                  What are you up to?

                             COLETTE
                  Nothing.

                             DANNY
                  What do you want from me, Colette?

                             COLETTE
                  I don't want anything. Why are you
                  so suspicious?

                             DANNY
                  It gets me through the day.

                             COLETTE
                  You really need to lighten up.

She puts her hand on his leg. 

                             COLETTE (cont'd)
                  Just relax.

He moves his leg away. 

                             DANNY
                  Look, I can't help you with Quincey
                  if that's what you're after.

                             COLETTE
                  This has nothing to do with him.

                             DANNY
                  So you're just attracted to me, is that it?

                             COLETTE
                  Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?

                             DANNY
                  How much time do you have?

                             COLETTE
                  What is wrong with you?

                             DANNY
                  How much time do you have?


                             COLETTE
                  You've got a comeback for everything,
                  don't you, Danny? You use 'em like
                  some sort of shield.

                             DANNY
                  Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?

                             COLETTE
                  There you go again. You're nothing
                  but false notes.

                             DANNY
                  You don't like the tune, find another
                  station.

                             COLETTE
                  What are you hiding, Danny?

                             DANNY
                  Therapy session is over.

He closes the keyboard cover. 

                             COLETTE
                  You think you're the only one down
                  here with a sad story?

                             DANNY
                  No. But I'm the only one with my sad
                  story.
                       (beat)
                  And that's how it's gonna stay.

INT. CAR - DAY

Still raining.  Tanner negotiates the slow traffic.

Danny looking at a MUG SHOT OF POOH-BEAR.

                             Garcetti
                  Harlan Dale Monty a.k.a. Pooh-Bear.
                  Did five years manslaughter for
                  beating a pimp to death with an
                  electric wheelchair.

                             DANNY
                  Excuse me?

                             GARCETTI
                  Several possession charges, but nothing major.

                             DANNY
                  Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?

                             GARCETTI
                  They have. But they never found a lab.

                             TANNER
                  That's because he doesn't have one.

                             DANNY
                  Whata you mean?  He told me -

                             TANNER
                  Guy scores dope and dollar from
                  ripping off other drug dealers.  As
                  least that's what the word is.

                             DANNY
                  What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?

                             TANNER
                  That's probably what he would have
                  done if we hadn't found out about
                  your get-rich-quick scheme.

                             GARCETTI
                  You're lucky, Flynne.

                             DANNY
                  Funny, I don't feel lucky.

                             GARCETTI
                  We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D..
                  We'll have your sorry ass covered.

                             DANNY
                  What if he caps me before you can
                  make a move?

                             TANNER
                  Golly, I hadn't thought of that.

                             GARCETTI
                  Don't we always take good care of you?

Danny doesn't look reassured.

                             DANNY
                  Speaking of which ... you run that license
                  plate for me?

                             GARCETTI
                  You mean the menacing red car?

Garcetti and Tanner exchange a smile.

                             DANNY
                  What? Is it bad?

                             TANNER
                  I'm afraid so, Danny.

                             DANNY
                  Who is it?

                             GARCETTI
                  Brace yourself.

Danny's eyes dart back and forth between Garcetti and Tanner.

                             DANNY
                  Come on! Who is it?  Domingo's boys?

                             GARCETTI
                  Worse. Much worse.
                       (beat)
                  A teacher.

Garcetti and Tanner break out laughing.


                             TANNER
                  Car is registered to a Mrs. Nancy Plummer.

Danny reacts to the name, not listening to the rest of what Garcetti 
and Tanner have to say.

                             GARCETTI
                  She's 57 and she's been teaching
                  third grade for the last 33 years.

                             TANNER
                  Now that's scary!

Danny lost in thought.

                             GARCETTI
                  You're paranoid, Flynne.  I think
                  that crank is finally starting to get
                  the best of you.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Danny waiting on the corner.

                             GARCETTI (V.O.)
                  When is the deal going down?

                             DANNY (V.O.)
                  I'm making the small buy tonight ...
                  if I don't get beaten to death with a
                  wheelchair or something.  If
                  everyone is happy, we'll do the big
                  deal later in the week.

Jimmy's Vega sputters to a stop in front of Danny.  Jimmy gets out and 
hands Danny the keys.

ON THE BUMPTER, a hand-made sign. It reads: PULL ME OVER. I DARE YOU!

Danny sighs. Walks to the back, rips the sign off and gets in the car, 
leaving Jimmy with the sign.
                             JIMMY
                  You sure you don't want me to go with you?

Danny burns rubber.

EXT. POOH-BEAR'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

Danny being led towards a trailer by TWO OF POOH-BEAR'S MEN. LITTLE 
BILL AND BIG BILL. Little Bill is big and Big Bill is little.

INT. HOUSE - SAME

Pooh-Bear sitting in a recliner, obscured by shadows when Danny and his 
escorts enter.

A WIRE CAGE IN THE CORNER, SOMETHING MOVING AROUND INSIDE.  It too is 
obscured by shadows.

Pooh-Bear doesn't look up. He is preoccupied with something in his hand 
which he is cleaning with a toothbrush.

                             DANNY
                  Pooh-Bear, my man.  What's up?

Pooh-Bear doesn't respond. Continues brushing.

                             LITTLE BILL
                  He's blue.

                             BIG BILL
                  Comin' down from a 10 day ride.

Danny closes his eyes. Not what he wanted to hear.

                             DANNY
                  You want to do this some other time?

                             POOH-BEAR
                       (gloomy and tired)
                  Pull your pants down.

                             DANNY
                  I'm sorry?

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Pull your motherfucking pants down.

Danny looks to the two Bills for help.

                             DANNY
                       (laughing nervously)
                  Come on, guys ...

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Big Bill.

Big Bill pulls a 19th century double-barreled FLINTLOCK PISTOL from his 
jacket and points it at Danny's head.

                             BIG BILL
                  Argh, matie. I'm a pirate.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Little Bill

Little Bill drops Danny's trousers.  Danny about to object when he is 
started into silence.

The saturnine Pooh-Bear raises his head, illuminating his face.  He 
isn't wearing his prosthetic nose.  A GAPING HOLE WHERE HIS NOSE SHOULD 
BE.  He looks like some obscene human bat.

Pooh-Bear holds up the plastic nose he has been cleaning, inspecting it 
under the light.


                             POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
                  Introduce him to Captain Steubing.

He pops his nose back into place, but it goes on crooked.

The Bills escort Danny over to the cage.  There is A GIGANTIC CRAZED 
WEASEL INSIDE.

The cage is divided by a large piece of Plexiglas.

                             POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
                  You'll have to excuse him, he ain't
                  ate for over a week.

The weasel is foaming at the mouth.

                             POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
                  That and the rabies.  Don't make for
                  a happy weasel.

                             DANNY
                       (trying to stay calm)
                  Pooh-Bear. come on, man.  What is
                  this?
                       (off Pooh-Bear's silence)
                  It's me, Danny. I thought we had a deal.

                             POOH-BEAR
                             Big Bill
                  
                  Big Bill pushes Danny up to the cage, which comes up to about waist 
                  level.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Captain Steubing thinks you might
                  work for the police.

                             DANNY
                  What?!

Pooh-Bear holds up his hand.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Don't address me.  I didn't make the
                  accusation.

                             DANNY
                  Please .. I don't know what you're ...

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Uh-uh-uh ...

He points to the cage.   Danny looks down at the weasel, which is 
trying to gnaw through the Plexiglas.

                             DANNY
                  Jesus Christ.
                       (to the weasel)
                  Um ... I'm not .. Captain Steubing.
                  I'm not working for the cops.

The weasel continues to gnaw.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  He don't believe you. Big Bill.


                             BIG BILL
                  Drop your package in the cage.

                             DANNY
                  My what?

                             BIG BILL
                  Put your pee-pee through the hole.

There is a hole in the top of the cage on the opposite side of the 
Plexiglas from Captain Steubing.
                             DANNY
                  This is fucking crazy!

Big Bill pulls back the hammer on the gun.

                             BIG BILL
                  Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.

                             DANNY
                  Oh fuck ... oh Jesus ...

Danny's eyes dart quickly over to Little Bill, who like everyone else, 
is watching the weasel.

Little Bill is wearing a big, filthy pea coat with A LARGE TEAR on the 
side.

Danny still hasn't complied with Pooh-Bear's order.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Shoot him.

                             DANNY
                  Okay! Okay!

From behind, we see Danny bend slightly, dropping his privates into the 
cage.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                       (eyeing the wild rodent)
                  Oh my God ... oh-my-fucking-God ...

Danny tries to stay calm, shoots another look at Little Bill who is 
standing right next to him.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Now get talkin'

                             DANNY
                  I didn't fucking do anything! I
                  swear to God!

Pooh-Bear leans forward and opens the Plexiglas partition about half an 
inch.

THE WEASEL bolts for the opening, gnashing its teeth, trying to squirm 
through.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  You got something to tell Captain
                  Steubing, you'd better do it now.

The weasel squirms and squeals and bangs against the Plexiglas.

Danny uses the diversion.  He quickly TAKES SOMETHING from him own 
jacket pocket and SLIPS IT IN THE HOLE IN LITTLE BILL'S JACKET between 
the coat and the lining.

No one notices.

Pooh-Bear opens the Plexiglas even more.  The weasel is able to get his 
head through the hole.  He bares his filthy teeth.

                             DANNY
                       (rapid-fire)
                  Captain Steubing, listen to me.
                  You're after the wrong guy. This is
                  the fuck you should be talking to.

He nods towards Little Bill.  Pooh-Bear cocks his head.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Jimmy told me that Little Bill's been
                  shorting Pooh-Bear ... settin' up his
                  own stuff on the side.

                             LITTLE BILL
                  That's a pack of discharge.

Danny now makes eye contact with Pooh-Bear, who listens intently.

                             DANNY
                  It's true. Jimmy saw him flashing a
                  pimp role at a bar the other night ...
                  said he was dissin' your ass in front
                  of one of your customers.

Pooh-Bear rises slowly.  Approaches the triumvirate.

Danny keeps one eye on ...

... the weasel as it continues its assault on the opening.


                             POOH-BEAR
                  Man'll say a lot of thing when he's
                  sporting weasel food for a pecker.

                             LITTLE BILL
                  Damn straight.


                             POOH-BEAR
                  Least I can do is check it out though.

Pooh-Bear pulls a chrome .45 from his waistband.

                             DANNY
                  Can I pull my dick out now?

Pooh-Bear limply aims the .45 at Little Bill.

                             POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
                             Big Bill
                  
                  Big Bill pats Little Bill down.

                             LITTLE BILL
                       (holding up his arms)
                  Go ahead. I got nothing to hide.

Big Bill checks all of Little Bill's pockets, coming up empty.

The weasel has squeezed about a third of the way through the hole.

                             DANNY
                  Can I pull my dick out?

Danny, panicked, eyes the hole in the pea coat.

                             BIG BILL
                  He's clean.

Danny can't believe it.  But when Little Bill lowers his arms, a big 
roll of cash protrudes from the hole.

Pooh-Bear and Big Bill see it immediately.

                             LITTLE BILL
                  What?

He follows their gaze to the cash.

                             DANNY
                  CAN I PULL MY FUCKING DICK OUT?!

                             POOH-BEAR
                       (eyes on Little Bill)
                  Yeah.

Danny extracts himself from the cage just as ...

... the weasel bolts through the opening and springs for the hold in 
the cage.

INT. POOH-BEAR'S KITCHEN - NIGHT (LATER)

Danny sitting at the kitchen table.  THE SCREAMS OF LITTLE BILL AUDIBLE 
FROM THE OTHER ROOM.

Danny is FIDDLING WITH SOMETHING UNDER THE TABLE when he HEARS POOH-
BEAR APPROACHING.

Danny finishes up, stuffing a roll of DUCT TAPE into his pocket.

Pooh-Bear drops a zip-lock bag of METH on the table.

                             DANNY
                  I ought to just call this whole thing
                  off right now.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Don't do that. Please.  Or I'll kill
                  you.  Please, Danny.

                             DANNY
                  What the hell was that? Who told you
                  I was five-0?

                             POOH-BEAR
                  No one. It was just a test. I need
                  to be sure of who I'm dealing with
                  from time-to-time.

Pooh-Bear nudges the baggie towards Danny.


                             POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
                  Take it easy.  You passed.

Danny hands over the bundle of cash. Pockets the dope.

                             DANNY
                  Did it ever occur to you that someone
                  might cop to something they didn't do
                  rather than have their balls chewed
                  off by a rabid weasel?

                             POOH-BEAR
                  I'll keep that in mind.

MOVE UNDER THE TABLE - Danny's Glock taped to the underside, out of 
sight.

EXT. DESERTED PARK - NIGHT

Danny, Garcetti and Tanner.  Tanner doing a chemical test on the meth 
with a field kit.  The tester turns a tell-tale blue.


                             TANNER
                  We're in business.

                             GARCETTI
                  Good work, Flynne.  You're a first-rate rat.

                             DANNY
                  That's real sweet, Garcetti.  Thanks.

                             TANNER
                  We got the 411 on your good old boy.

Tanner produces a print out from an F.B.I criminal computer file.  A 
MUG SHOT OF BUBBA.  The name BUFORD "BUBBA" NGUYEN underneath.

                             TANNER (cont'd)
                  Nothing local so we ran his prints
                  through the F.B.I. Believed to be a
                  major supplier in Texas.  Jumped bail
                  on a murder rap last April.

                             DANNY
                  Murder.  Beautiful.

                             TANNER
                  Pumped fifty-seven bullets into a police informant.

Danny heaves a sign and plops down on a bench.

                             DANNY
                  You know, I'm starting to think I'd
                  rather take my chances with Domingo
                  than go through any more of this shit.

                             GARCETTI
                  Didn't you hear?  Domingo's dead.

Danny looks up.

                             TANNER
                  Took a pig-slicker to the heart.

                             DANNY
                  Jesus.

                             TANNER
                  I thought you'd be happy.

                             DANNY
                  Yeah.

He doesn't look happy.

INT. PRISON - NIGHT

Domingo sprawled face-down on the tile floor of the shower room.  Blood 
leaking from underneath him.

WATER PATTERS DOWN FROM THE SHOWER HEAD.  DILUTING THE POOL OF BLOOD.  
THE SOUND IS UNNATURALLY LOUD.

EXT. PALOS VERDES - NIGHT

The red car with "IFORGIV" plates parked in the driveway of a modest 
Spanish-style house.

INT. PALSO VERDES - NIGHT

NANCY AND VERNE PLUMMER watching TV.

Photos of Liz on top of a baby grand piano.  A SHRINE OF SORTS.

CATHOLIC ICONS ABOUND: crucifixes, Virgin Mary's, needle point prayers.

A KNOCK ON THE DOOR.  Nancy gets up to answer.

                             NANCY
                  Who is it?

                             DANNY (O.S.)
                  It's Tom.

Nancy and Verne look at one another.


INT. PALOS VERDES HOUSE - NIGHT

Danny and Verne sitting at the dining room table.  Nancy brings in a 
pot of coffee.  Verne eyes Danny silently.  Danny won't look him in the 
eye.

                             DANNY
                  All right, Nancy, how'd you track me down?

                             NANCY
                  Billy Sutcliffe said he saw you at a
                  bar down in Gardena a few weeks ago.
                  Said you looked so bad, he barely
                  recognized you.

Nancy pours the coffee.

                             NANCY (cont'd)
                  Billy's a cop now, you know.

                             VERNE
                  Highway Patrol.

                             NANCY
                  He said you were ... the people you 
                  Were with ... well ...

                             VERNE
                  Said you were a drug addict.

                             DANNY
                  Maybe I should just go.

Danny pushes away from the table.  Nancy grabs Danny's wrist.

                             NANCY
                  No. We want to help you, Tom.

Danny stays put.

                             NANCY (cont'd)
                  I know everyone deals with grief in
                  their own way.  I know how hard it is
                  to find closure.

                             DANNY
                  Closure? How do you find closure
                  when her killers are still running
                  around out there?

                             NANCY
                  I found forgiveness in my heart for
                  the people who killed my daughter. I
                  gave my grief to Jesus Christ.

                             DANNY
                  Is that what you want me to do?  Put
                  it all on Jesus?  Let him sort it out
                  in the afterlife?

                             NANCY
                  You've got to deal with this sooner
                  or later, Tom. You can't keep
                  hiding.

                             DANNY
                  Maybe I am dealing with it.

                             NANCY
                  I know it's not my place to pass
                  judgement on you but ...

Danny looks at the shrine to Liz on top of the piano.



                             DANNY
                  Then why don't I see any pictures
                  Of me up there?

                             VERNE
                  That was my idea.

                             DANNY
                  You never did like me much, did you
                  Verne?
                       (beat)
                  And you can't stand it that I walked
                  out of there alive and Liz didn't.
                  You think I'm a coward,
                  don't you?

Verne's silence is answer enough.



                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  I don't blame you for hating me.  At
                  least I understand that.
                       (back to Nancy)
                  But forgiving the butchers who killed
                  Liz well I'm having some trouble
                  with that one.

                             NANCY
                  Love your enemies, bless them that
                  curse you, do good to them that hate
                  you, and pray for them which
                  despitefully use you, a persecute
                  you.

Danny touches Nancy's hand tenderly.

                             DANNY
                  I'm genuinely happy that you found
                  some peace, Nancy. But you can't
                  forgive for Liz.  No one can.  And
                  you can't forgive for me.

                             NANCY
                  Your hatred makes them stronger and
                  you weaker.

                             DANNY
                  I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred.
                       (beat)
                  Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night 
                  she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a
                  chance to apologize to her.  Do you know what that feels like?

                             NANCY
                  It's not too late to show her you're sorry.

                             DANNY
                  How?

Verne slams his hand down on the table.

                             VERNE
                  By not disgracing her memory!

                             DANNY
                  What does that mean?

                             VERNE
                  You might as well be spitting on her
                  grave every time you put drugs up
                  your nose.  Or did you just
                  conveniently forget that it was drug
                  dealers who killed my daughter?

Verne glares at Danny.  No forgiveness in his heart.

                             VERNE (cont'd)
                  You ever think you might be buying
                  drugs from the very people who took
                  her life?

                             DANNY
                  You don't understand.

                             VERNE
                  Understand what?

Danny starts to say something.  Stops.

                             DANNY
                  Nothing. It's ... it's complicated. I
                  just want you to know ... I'm not what
                  you think I am.

INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Danny sitting at a table, the lockbox open in front of him.

He is endorsing the back of a life insurance check.  His Tom Van Allen 
driver's license laying next to it.

A KNOCK AT THE DOOR



                             DANNY
                  Who is it?

                             COLETTE (O.S.)
                  It's me.

                             DANNY
                  I'm kind of busy.

                             COLETTE (O.S.)
                  Please open the door, Danny.

He pockets the check and the license, closes the lockbox and goes over 
to the door.

Colette standing on the other side.  Her FACE AND ARMS ARE BLACK AND 
BLUE WITH BRUISES.
                             DANNY
                  Oh Jesus.

He lets her come in.  Colette looks away.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Colette ... You've gotta leave.

                             COLETTE
                  We been through that.

                             DANNY
                  What about a battered woman's
                  shelter? You can move you kid in
                  with you.

                             COLETTE
                  I need my paycheck.

                             DANNY
                  You can still work.

                             COLETTE
                  He knows where I work.

                             DANNY
                  Find a new job.


                             COLETTE
                  It's not that easy. I just got a
                  raise. I need the money.

                             DANNY
                  You always been this stubborn?

Colette cracks a crooked smile.

                             COLETTE
                  From day one.
                       (beat)
                  I was a breach birth. They tried for
                  hours to turn my little butt around.
                  But I wouldn't let 'em.

                             DANNY
                  Ass first into the world.

                             COLETTE
                  I been that way ever since.

Danny smiles.  He gently touches her eye.  Colette reaches up and 
touches Danny's bruised eye.
                             COLETTE (cont'd)
                  Look at us.  What a pair.

Colette leans in to kiss him, but they bump bad eyes.

                             COLETTE/DANNY
                  Ouch.
                  They laugh.

                             COLETTE
                  Can we try that again?

They kiss again.  Deep and long.  Danny suddenly pulls back mid-kiss.

                             DANNY
                  I can't.

Colette goes to touch him. He pulls away.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  I can't.

                             COLETTE
                  Why not?

                             DANNY
                  I just can't. Okay?

Danny paces uncomfortably.

                             COLETTE
                  What's wrong, Danny?

                             DANNY
                  Look, maybe you oughta' leave.


                             COLETTE
                  No. I want to know what the hell
                  is going on.

                             DANNY
                  I can't tell you.

Colette comes to a slow realization.

                             COLETTE
                  There's someone else, isn't there?

THE FLASHBACK IMAGERY suddenly FLICKERS TO LIFE on the wall behind 
Danny - THE MOONLIGH SALTON SEA.

Danny freezes.  Looks up at Colette.
                             DANNY
                  Yes.

Colette waits a beat, then turns to leave.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Don't go.
                       (beat)
                  Please, Colette.
                       (she stops)
                  Stay and talk to me, please.

Something about Danny's voice - a raw vulnerability - which we haven't 
seen in him before.  MOVE OFF of Danny and ONTO THE FLASHBACK IMAGE.

                             DANNY (O.S.)
                  I'm so tired of lying.
                                                      CUT TO:


EXT. CREPPY HOUSE - SALTON SEA - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Danny's car parked out front.

INT. CREEPY HOUSE - SALTON SEA - NIGHT

A CHUBBY GUY sitting on the couch in his underwear, watching A MEXICAN 
WESTERN.  He sits there with wide eyes, GRINDING HIS JAWS.

Danny, Liz AND BO, the affable owner of the house, looking at a map on 
the kitchen table.

                             BO
                  What you want to do is go back the
                  way you came and make a left at the
                  bottom. It'll take you right to the
                  highway.

                             DANNY/TOM
                  That's it?

                             BO
                  Are you Australian?

                             DANNY/TOM
                  No.

                             BO
                  Good. I fucking hate Australians.

Danny and Liz share a look.

                             DANNY/TOM
                  You got a bathroom I can use before
                  we hit the road?

                             BO
                  Yeah? First door on the right.
                  It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda'
                  filthy is all.

                             DANNY/TOM
                       (to Liz)
                  You mind?



                             BO
                  No, I don't mind.  That's how come I
                  told you about it.

                             DANNY/TOM
                  I was talking to my wife.

                             LIZ
                  Try to make it fast.

Danny heads down the hallway, Liz looks a little uncomfortable.

                             LIZ (cont'd)
                       (trying to make small talk)
                  So.  What do you do for a living around here?

                             BO
                  You know. This and that.

ON THE SHELVES, SUNDRY ITEMS USED TO DISTILL METH.

Bo scratching his arms.

Liz notices TRACK MARKS ALL OVER BO'S ARMS.  He sees her looking.

                             BO
                  Skeeters. They're bad up here.

INT. BATHROOM - SAME

Danny peeing WHEN HE HEARS ANOTHER CAR PULL UP OUTSIDE.  CAR DOORS OPEN 
AND CLOSE.  HUSHED VOICES  OUTSIDE THE BATHROOM WINDOW.

Danny finishes up.  He steps up onto the tub and peaks out the bathroom 
window.

THROUGH THE WINDOW - TWO FIGURES CROSS IN FRONT OF THE HEADLIGHTS OF 
THE CAR.  THE ENGINE REMAINS RUNNING.

Danny frowns, not sure what to make of it.  He steps down from the tub 
and is just about to exit when THE FRONT DOORS IS KICKED OPEN AND SHOTS 
ARE FIRED.

VOICES SHOUTING.

Danny freezes, not sure what to do. His eyes dart around for a weapon.

He picks up a large plumber's wrench and goes to the bathroom door.

MORE SHOTS.  SEMI-AUTOMATIC FIRE.

SEVERAL BULLETS slam through the bathroom wall, one striking Danny in 
the shoulder.

He slumps to the floor.

THE PANDEMONIUM continues in the front room.

There is a BULLET HOLE about the size of a fifty cent piece in the wall 
next to Danny's head.  He puts his eye to the hole and looks out.

DANNY'S P.O.V. THROUGH THE HOLE - scanning the room.  Stopping on ...

... LIZ. In the confusion, she has managed to hide from the intruders.  
She is squeezed into a tiny space between the sofa and the wall.  She 
clings tightly to the curtains, her hands shaking violently.

ONE THE CURTAIN RINGS - pulled taught by Liz's grip.

Danny adjusts his gaze through the hole.

THROUGH THE HOLE - scanning to the other side of the room.  Bo and the 
other guy sprawled on the floor. INTRUDER ONE stands over them, only 
his legs visible.

BACK ON LIZ - scared to death, clinging to the curtains.

The curtain rings are pulled to the breaking point.


INTRUDER ONE
Let's go!

INTRUDER TWO emerges from the back carrying a small nylon bag.  They 
start to head out the front door when ...

... one of the curtain rings breaks with a METALLIC "TING".

ON DANNY - freaking. His eyes shooting back to Liz.

SILENCE.

Listening.

Then the CREAKING FOOTSTEPS of Intruder One approaching. It takes an 
eternity.

Liz can't possibly see Danny through the hole but it looks like she is 
staring directly at him, her body rigid with fear.

Danny grabs the wrench again.  Tries to get to his feet but slips back 
down, either too weak from loss of blood or just plain scared.  His 
hand is shaking violently.

He looks through the hole again.

THROUGH THE HOLE - Liz still staring at Danny. THE FOOTSTEPS CONTENCE 
at a agonizing slow pace, then stop.

A GUN, ever so slowly, enters FRAME. EXTREME CLOSE UP on Liz's eyes as 
they widen.

EXTREME CLOSE UP on Danny's eye peering through the hole. A SHOT IS 
FIRED. His eye closes.

ON DANNY-his mouth opens to scream BUT NOTHING COMES OUT.

And with that it is all over.

Danny tries to get to his feet again. Fails, His eyes flutter. All is 
silent except for A FAINT LIQUID SPATTERING.

LONG SHOT-Back on the Salton Sea, placid and silvered with moonlight.

INT RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM- NIGHT (LATER)

Danny and Colette face-to face- in profile, silhouetted by the IMAGE of 
the sea.

                             DANNY
                  She died knowing that I was a coward...
                  that I didn't lift a finger to help her.

                             COLLETTE
                  There was nothing you could have done.

She is inches closer to him.


                             DANNY
                  No, you're wrong, I tried to tell 
                  myself the same thing but I could
                  have gotten up. I could have done 
                  something.

                             COLETTE
                  They would have killed you too.

                             DANNY
                       (finally looks her in the eye)
                  Nothing could be worse then this 
                  slow death I'm living now.

Colette puts her arms around him and hugs him tight. The IMAGE OF THE 
SEA FLICKERS AND FADES behind them.

CLOSE ON DANNY-holding Colette.

                             DANNY
                       (looking up)
                  Colette...I want to help 
                  you, with Quincey.

Colette pulls back.

                             COLETTE
                  No Danny, Don't-


                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  But you gotta be serious about it.

                             COLETTE
                  Really, I don't want to.

                             DANNY
                  I want to do this for you.  I 
                  want to do something good 
                  for a change.

Danny goes over to the dresser. Takes out a baggie of meth.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  I want you to hide this
                  somewhere where Quincy
                  won't find it.

                             COLETTE
                  What is it?

                             DANNY
                  Never mind. Just do what I say.
                  He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.

                             COLETTE
                  I don't want to.

Danny stalks her.

                             DANNY
                  I'm offering you the chance to take 
                  care of your problems. Take it.
                       (she still hesitates)
                  Don't make the same mistake I did,
                  Colette. Do something while you 
                  have a chance. Do it for your daughter 
                  before something happens.
                       (beat)
                  Believe me, you don't want to 
                  live with this burden.
                       (firm)
                  He helds the baggie out again. Colette 
                  reluctantly takes it from him.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Tommorrow night, when he is asleep. 
                  I want you to beep me at this number.
                  He writes the number down on a dollar bill.

                             DANNY
                  Will you do that?
                       (off her nod)
                  Then I want you to get out of the room.

                             COLETTE
                  Why?

                             DANNY
                  Don't worry about it. Just go across 
                  the street and watch. You'll know 
                  when it's safe to go back.

Colette goes to protest. Danny puts his hand to her mouth the same way 
she did to him earlier.

                             DANNY
                  Just do it. All your problems with 
                  Quincey will be taken care of.

INT. CINDER BLOCK BAR - DAY

Empty except for Danny and Jimmy in a back booth. Danny slides an 
envelope over to Jimmy.

                             JIMMY
                  What's this?

                             DANNY
                  Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare.
                       (beat)
                  It's for you.

                             JIMMY
                  But why? You only owe me five. And 
                  that's not till after we close the deal tonight.

                             DANNY
                  You aren't coming with me.

Jimmy looks hurt.


                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  I need you to do me a favor instead.

                             JIMMY
                  Okay

                             DANNY
                  Wait till I tell you what it is.

                             JIMMY
                  It don't matter. I'll do it. And you
                  sure as hell don't have to pay me.

Jimmy slides the money back over.

                             DANNY
                  Why?

                             JIMMY
                  You're my best friend, man. I'd do 
                  anything for you.

Danny smiles, genuinely touched.

                             DANNY
                  Jimmy, look, there's something I have
                  to tell you.

                             JIMMY
                  Hey, check it out...

Jimmy rolls his sleeve up, revealing a tattoo.


                             DANNY
                  What the hell is that?

ON THE TATTOO: CRUDLEY DRAWN FACE.

                             JIMMY
                       (Proudly)
                  It's you! I didn't have a picture or
                  nothin' so I had to describe you to
                  the guy. Not bad though, huh?

Jimmy sits there, admiring the tattoo.

Danny stares at Jimmy with pity.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  I really have to tell you something.
                  It's important.

                             JIMMY
                  What?

                             DANNY
                  I'm not a tweaker.
                       (beat)
                  I don't use drugs. I never had.

Danny is deadpan.  Jimmy starts laughing

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  I'm not joking.

Jimmy keeps laughing. Danny staring, deadpan, Jimmy slowly stops 
laughing.

                             JIMMY
                  But...I've seen you.

                             DANNY
                  When? When did you ever see me use?

                             JIMMY
                  This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth
                  question, is it?

                             DANNY
                  You ever notice how I always showed 
                  up, in the middle of a binge? Left 
                  before it was over? How I sneak away 
                  for cap-naps? How when the crank 
                  came around to me, I always said I'd 
                  just done one?

Jimmy slack-jawed.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  You asked me how I always keep my 
                  shit together. Well, that's how.

                             JIMMY
                  No one ever noticed?

                             DANNY
                  Are you kidding me? A bunch of amped
                  -out tweakers? It was easy.

Jimmy is agitated and confused.

                             JIMMY
                  But... why? Why would you pretend?

                             DANNY
                  I can't tell you.

                             JIMMY
                  You don't trust me?

                             DANNY
                  I don't trust anybody.

                             JIMMY
                  And you want me to do you some big favor?

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  It's cool. I understand
                  Danny gets up to leave.

                             JIMMY
                  Wait
                       (beat)
                  If you don't trust me, why did you 
                  tell me that stuff about not using drugs?

                             DANNY
                  Because I don't want to see you end 
                  up like Kujo and those other losers.
                       (beat)
                  I thought that maybe if you knew that 
                  I didn't use, you might see it in 
                  yourself to go clear.

EXT. BACK OF CINDERBLOCK BAR- DAY (LATER)

Jimmy and Danny squinting in the mid-morning sun. They stand face-to-
face.

                             DANNY
                  You mad at me, Jimmy?

Jimmy shrugs.

                             JIMMY
                  I don't know... a little. I wish you 
                  would have let me in on it from the 
                  beginning.

                             DANNY
                  I'm sorry. I couldn't.

Danny taps Jimmy's arm.

                             DANNY
                  You know you can get that tattoo removed,
                  don't you.

Jimmy rubs his arm where the tattoo is.

                             JIMMY
                  Nah... I want to keep it.
                       (beat)
                  Maybe I can use it for like, inspiration
                  ...you know...like when
                  I detox?

                             DANNY
                  Good for you Jimmy.

Danny takes the envelope from his pocket.

                             DANNY
                  I really want you to take this.

Danny tries to hive Jimmy the envelope. Jimmy pushes it away.

                             JIMMY
                  Wouldn't be a favor if you were 
                  paying me. I'll just take my five 
                  when the deal is done.

                             DANNY
                  You're a good man. Jimmy the Finn.

BUBBA answers a cell phone on the other end.

                             BUBBA
                  Yeah.

CONVERSATION WILL INTERCUT BETWEEN TWO LOCATIONS

                             DANNY
                  Everything go?

                             BUBBA
                  Yeah.

                             DANNY
                  Just make sure you come alone. This 
                  guy won't like any surprises

                             BUBBA
                  I ain't a idiot, asshole.

                             DANNY
                  I'll see you tonight.

Bubba hangs up.

Danny turns the phone off.

                             TANNER
                  Man of few words.

Danny hands the phone back to Garcetti

                             GARCETTI
                  Nervous?

                             DANNY
                  With you clowns watching my back? What 
                  do you think?

Danny opens the back door.

                             GARCETTI
                  Just make sure you hit the floor when 
                  we come in. It could get ugly in there.

                             TANNER
                  Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.

Danny gets out of the car. Shuts the door.

EXT. CAR-SAME

Danny watches them drive away. When he is sure that they are gone, he 
looks around. Sees...
...A PLUMBER'S TRUCK parked on the other side of the park.

INT. PLUMBER'S TRUCK-SAME
AN HISPANIC GUY behind the wheel.

HISPANIC GUY
He's coming in.

As Danny approaches the truck, the door slides open. He piles in.

                             VOICES (O.S.)
                  How'd it go?

                             DANNY
                  You tell me.

Danny pulls a TINY MICROPHONE AND WIRE from inside his shirt and hands 
it to...
...Bubba, who sits in front of a BANK OF LISTENING EQUIPMENT.

                             BUBBA
                  You ready to go meet the team?

EXT. FEDERAL BUILDING - WESTWOOD - DAY

The PLUMBER'S TRUCK enters the underground parking lot.

INT. F.B.I. OFFICES-DAY

TEN F.B.I. AGENTS in a small conference room, looking at...

...Danny and Bubba, sitting at the head of the table. BUBBA is now 
wearing his security badge, which reads, SPECIAL AGENT TEX TRAHN. He 
stands up and addresses the group.

And he really does have a SOUTHERN ACCENT.

                             TRAHN
                  For those of you who don't know this 
                  is Tom Van Allen... a.k.a.  Danny 
                  Flynne.

Danny looks self-conscious.

                             TRAHN (cont'd)
                  About a year and half ago, Mr. Van 
                  Allen's wife was murdered at a meth 
                  lab out near the Salton Sea. No one 
                  was ever apprehended for the crime 
                  but local authorities have always 
                  assumed it was a hit and grab 
                  perpetrated by rival drug dealers. 
                  That is, until Tom here took it upon 
                  himself to conduct a one-man 
                  undercover operation at great risk to 
                  his own personal safety.

One of the agents pipes up...

                             AGENT ONE
                  He's a civilian?
                       (off Trahn's nod)
                  How the hell did you pull this off?

Trahn turns to Danny.

                             DANNY
                  I played the long shot. Just got lucky.

INT. SALTON SEA SHERIFF'S STATION (FLASHBACK) - DAY

Danny and DETECTIVE BOOKMAN, a homicide detective, sitting at a table.

                             BOOKMAN
                  How about the car? The model?

Danny shakes his head.

                             BOOKMAN (cont'd)
                  Was it a truck?  S.U.V.? Sedan?


                             DANNY
                  All I saw was the headlights. The high 
                  beams were on.

                             BOOKMAN
                  Not even a guess?

                             DANNY
                       (pissed off0
                  How many times do we have to go through 
                  this?

ANOTHER DETECTIVE enters the room, hands something to bookman, then 
whispers into Bookman's ear. Bookman nods.

                             BOOKMAN (cont'd)
                  You said one of the perpetrators crossed 
                  in front of the headlights ...

                             DANNY
                  Yeah, but he was in silhouette.

                             BOOKMAN
                  How about in the house?

                             DANNY
                  They were wearing ski masks. I told 
                  you all of this.

                             BOOKMAN
                  Did you see his hair color?

                             DANNY
                  No, Why?

Bookman holds up a small plastic evidence baggie.

                             BOOKMAN
                  Forensics found this on your wife.

Bookman holds it up to the light. Inside, ONE BRIGHT RED HAIR.

ON DANNY staring at the hair, remembering something...

EXT. SALTON SEA GAS STATION - DAY (FLASHBACK WITHIN THE FLASHBACK)

Danny putting gas in his car, Liz in the passenger's seat reading.

The brightest, reddest hair you've ever seen with a BIG STREAK OF WHITE 
RUNNING THROUGH IT.

His back is TURNED. We can't see his face.

                  Nothing, I'm trying to remember...

Danny feigns frustration.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  I'm sorry... I didn't see his hair

Danny looks up.

                             DANNY
                  Because I wanted to find them myself
                       (beat)
                  I wanted to kill them.

                  I swear to God I would have done 'em
                  right then and there...but I had to
                  be positive.  And even if Tanner was
                  involved, I had to be sure about
                             Garcetti

                  I gave up whoever they asked for, 
                  whenever they wanted. I was a 
                  fucking dream rat. But the whole 
                  time I was sizing them up, looking 
                  for any evidence that they were the 
                  guys who killed my wife.

F.B.I. OFFICES-DAY


                             DANNY
                  I knew that if these were the guys I 
                  was looking for, I'd have to set up a 
                  deal so sweet, they wouldn't be able 
                  to walk away from it.

                             TRAHN
                  That's when he called me. He told me 
                  his story and he pitched me a plan.

                             DANNY
                  These guys are smart. I knew they 
                  wouldn't hit a deal unless they knew 
                  all the players. I needed a big buyer.

EXT. ROOFTOP-NIGHT

Tanner and Garcetti watching Battle enter the building.

                             TRAHN (V.O.)

                  and Garcetti with an "anonymous" tip 
                  about the deal.

                             TANNER
                       (the line takes on a whole new meaning)
                  This could be the one we're looking for.

                  How sure are you that you're not 
                  chasing two good cops? I mean all 
                  you've really got  is one red hair. 
                  That's still your only evidence.




                             TRAHN
                  Not anymore. We tapped these guys' phones 
                  and computers at Gardena P.D. 
                  Tanner and Garcetti didn't
                  report on this deal. Not a peep. 
                  They haven't coordinated with 
                  Palmdale P.D. They're keeping it off 
                  the books. It looks like we've got 
                  the right guys.
                       (beat)
                  We'll find out for sure tonight.

                  How you holding up?

                             DANNY
                  I'm fine. Little nervous...little 
                  disappointed that I didn't finish 
                  this myself.

                             TRAHN
                  Hey, you did the right thing. You 
                  wouldn't have stood a chance against 
                  these boys by yourself. They have 
                  eaten your ass alive.

Danny's PAGER STARTS BEEPING. He checks the readouts.

                             DANNY
                  Oh shit

                             TRAHN
                  What?

                             DANNY
                  Can you do me a favor? This girl I 
                  know, her boyfriend's a real piece of 
                  shit-dude's really jamming her up. 
                  I promised her I'd try to help.

Danny pockets the pager.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Could you call Gardena P.D. tell 'em 
                  you got a tip that the guy's holding?
                  Maybe have 'em send out a patrol car?

                             TRAHN
                  I'll see what I can do.

                  Any word from Pooh-Bear?

                  You okay, hoss?

BACK INSIDE THE ROOM

Trahn walks over to Danny, who sits there with his head down, his face 
obscured by a baseball cap. Slowly, he looks up.

IT IS JIMMY.

                             TRAHN (cont'd)
                  What the hell?

                             DANNY
                  Easy, boy.

He looks at his hand again. It continues to shake.  He takes a deep 
breath.

TANNER'S P.O.V.

As Danny gets out of the car and goes to the trunk.

Tanner watching.

                             TANNER
                  Where's Bubba?

                             GARCETTI
                  Maybe he isn't showing.

Danny takes a gym bag out of the trunk and approaches Pooh-Bear's 
house.

                             TANNER
                  Looks like Flynne's handling the
                  cash. Let's get into position.

They get out of the car and trek down the bluff towards the house.

INT. POOH-BEAR'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Big Bill lets Danny in, then pats him down for weapons.  Satisfied, he 
leads Danny to the kitchen.

IN THE KITCHEN - Danny enters and stops.  A worried look.

Pooh-Bear along with THREE OTHER MEN.  The men eye Danny silently.  
They look like ex-cons.

                             DANNY
                  What the hell is this?

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Just some buddies.

                             DANNY
                  This is bullshit.  You didn't say
                  anything about anybody else being here.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  What the fuck are you gonna do about
                  it, dickhead?

The other guys snicker, one of them almost spitting his beer out.

Danny smiles good-naturedly.  Shoots a look over at ...

... one of the guys sitting where he taped his gun earlier.

                             DANNY
                  Come on, man, let's deal.

He throws the bag on the table, knocking a beer into the guys lap.  The 
guy springs up, pissed off.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Cool it. We got business.

                             DANNY
                  Yeah, dickhead.

Danny moves over and plops down in the guys seat.

UNDER THE TABLE - Danny fumbling with the gun, trying to untape it 
without being too obvious.

Pooh-Bear unzips the bag. Inside, a lot of cash.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Oh my, oh my.
                       (beat)
                  Big Bill, come take a look at this.

Big Bill is behind Danny, over by the sink.  He pulls his FLINTLOCK and 
walks over.

Danny continues trying to get the gun loose.  Something catches his eye 
...

... the MICROWAVE OVEN DOOR is open, casting a reflection of the room 
behind him.  Big Bill approaches Danny, pointing the gun at Danny's 
head.

The other men ease back from the table a little.

UNDER THE TABLE - Danny still can't get the gun loose.

ON THE REFLECTION - Big Bill right behind Danny.  He raises the 
flintlock.

Danny bugging.  He rips at the gun. Too late.

Big Bill goes to fire.  Using the reflection, Danny ducks at the last 
instant.

Big Bill FIRES.

The guy across the table takes the mini-ball in the chest.

ALL IN AN INSTANT - Danny extricates the gun.  Turns on Big Bill, who 
sees the gun and holds his hands up.

Danny SHOOTS TWICE, the bullets blowing through Big Bill's hands and 
thumping into his chest.  Big Bill crumples.

When Pooh-Bear goes to pull his gun from his waist-band, it discharges, 
shooting him in the thigh.

The muzzle flash ignites his pants leg.  POOH-BEAR HITS THE FLOOR, 
SCREAMING, slapping at the fire on his leg.

Danny wheels on the other two guys at the table, who are going for 
their guns.  Danny opens up on them with the Glock, flooring them 
before they can get a shot off.

OUTSIDE - still descending the bluff, Tanner and Garcetti hear the 
gunfire.

INSIDE - Danny turns on Pooh-Bear, who sits there staring at his 
injured leg.

Danny puts the gun to Pooh-Bear's head, closes his eyes and starts to 
pull the trigger.

Pooh-Bear lifts his gun and SHOOTS DANNY IN THE TORSO THREE TIMES.  
Danny collapses.

Pooh-Bear gets to his feet.

                             POOH-BEAR
                  Oh lordy, oh lordy, oh lordy.  Pooh-
                  Bear done shot himself.

He's in shock.  He grabs the duffle bag from the table and staggers 
down the hallway, into the living room.

OUTSIDE - Tanner and Garcetti at the front door, listening. They pull 
their ski-masks on, take out their guns, then silently enter.

INSIDE - gunsmoke abounds.  One of the guys MOANS on the floor.

Tanner and Garcetti enter the kitchen, guns drawn and ready.  They 
survey the scene.

Bodies everywhere.

Big Bill lays there dying, staring with confusion at the stigmata in 
his hands.

Danny lying in a heap, next to Big Bill.

Suddenly, they hear POOH-BEAR MUMBLING from somewhere in the house.

Tanner signals for Garcetti to take point.  They head down the long 
hallway, slowly and silently.  When they are gone ...

... Danny stirs on the floor. His eyes open. He opens his shirt and 
checks his torso REVEALING THAT HE IS WEARING HIS BULLET-PROOF VEST.

He struggles to a sitting position, in great pain from the impact 
bruises left by the bullets.

He picks up his gun, gets up on wobbly legs and follows Tanner and 
Garcetti down the hall.

ON DANNY as he creeps down the hall.

INT. CREEPY HOUSE - SALTON SEA - NIGHT

Exiting the bathroom and creeping towards the front room.

                             DANNY
                  Anybody there?

ONLY THE SPLATTERING LIQUID SOUND.

Danny continues.

He stops at the end of the hall.  His eyes go wide with fear and 
revulsion.

THE LIQUID SOUND BECOMES LOUDER AND LOUDER UNTIL IT IS ALL THAT CAN BE 
HEARD.

Liz is still in her hiding place behind the end of the couch.  Her head 
is resting comfortably on the arm of the couch.  She looks fine.  There 
is even a slight smile on her lips.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Liz?

Then he notices it ...

... a widening pool of BLOOD seeps from under the couch like some 
living thing.  More blood patters down from some UNSEEN WOUND on the 
side of her head.

Danny staggers towards her.

Her eyes flutter slightly.

Danny sits next to her. Holds her hand.  There is nothing he can do.

Liz tries to speak.  Can't.

                             DANNY
                  I'm here, Liz. I'm here.

She squeezes his hand.  Then goes limp.

INT. POOH-BEAR'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Danny continues down the hall, remembering.

INT. CREEPY HOUSE - SALTON SEA - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Danny sitting there with Liz in a pool of blood.  He notices something 
on the floor ...

... LIZ'S PURSE, the contents spilled on the floor.  A GREETING CAR 
with a teddy bear and the word "CONGRATUALTIONS" on the front.

Danny goes over and picks up the card.

INSERT - CARD

He opens it  ... "YOU'RE A DADDY!"  A home pregnancy test taped inside, 
the reading is POSITIVE.

Danny drops the card.  Stares down at it as ...

... the blood from the floor pools out and engulfs the card.

EXT. SALTON SEA - NIGHT

On the placid sea as DANNY'S HORRIFIC SCREAM resounds from the house in 
the distance.

INT. POOH-BEAR'S HOUSE - NIGHT

ON DANNY standing in the hallway, staring, his face a blank.

ON POOH-BEAR - cooking up a huge dose of meth with a lighted hundred 
dollar bill.

He draws the meth into a syringe then turns on the stereo with a 
remote.

A YODELING INSTRUCTION TAPE BLASTS FROM THE SPEAKERS.

Pooh-Bear prepares to dose, looking for a vein in his neck, never 
noticing ...

... Garcetti's gun moving to the back of Pooh-Bear's head.

Pooh-Bear about to plunge the drugs when GARCETTI FIRES.

Pooh-Bear pitches forward, dead.  The syringe falls to the floor.

Tanner and Garcetti standing over him.  They pull their ski masks off.

                             GARCETTI
                  Get the bag.

Garcetti holsters his weapon and picks up the bag of money from the 
floor.

                             GARCETTI (cont'd)
                  Let's get out of here.

A GUNSHOT.  Garcetti goes down where he stands.  He lays there 
twitching like a rabbit.

Tanner staring down the sucker's end of Danny's gun.

                             TANNER
                  Danny?

                             DANNY
                  My name is Tom.

Tanner frowns.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Tom Van Allen

Danny raises his gun.

                             TANNER
                  Whatever you say, man.  Look ... can
                  we talk about this?

                             DANNY
                  Yeah. Okay. Listen carefully ...
                       (beat)
                  You're in the bathroom.  You've been
                  shot in the shoulder ...

Danny shoots Tanner in the shoulder.  He collapses to the floor.

ON GARCETTI - his eyes flutter and open.

Danny walks over to Tanner and stands above him.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  ... there's two guys with masks and
                  guns in the other room about to kill
                  your wife.

Tanner looks at Danny, confused.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  But you know if you go out there,
                  they'll kill you, too.  You'll both
                  die.  What do you do?

Tanner realizes what Danny is talking about.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Do you go out there and die like a
                  man or do you live to fight another day?

Tanner doesn't answer.

                             Danny (cont'd)
                  What do you do?

Still no answer.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Answer the question!

Tanner is ghost white, loosing blood quickly.

                             Danny (cont'd)
                  What do you do!

                             TANNER
                  Please ... don't do this ...

                             DANNY
                  Answer the fucking question!

When Danny goes to shoot Tanner again ...

... Tanner pulls a K-BAR KNIFE from the back of his belt and plunges it 
into the back of Danny's gun hand.  The gun discharges, missing Tanner.

Danny drops the gun.  Tanner snatches it up.

Tanner immediately has the gun inches from Danny's head.  Danny freezes 
...

                             TANNER
                  Does that answer your question?
                       (beat)
                  I fight.
                  I fight and I die like a man.
                       (beat)
                  You're a fucking coward, Flynne.  You
                  lived like one and now you're gonna
                  die like one.

Danny looks up at the gun, his face a blank.

                             DANNY
                       (mumbling)
                  Glock semi-automatic 9 mm ...

CLOSE ON THE BARREL OF THE GUN.  ALL SOUND FADES OUT.

MOVE INTO THE BARREL OF THE GUN.  THE BLACK KID'S FACE APPEARS INSIDE.

                             KID
                  Tenifer matte finish, Polymer grip,
                  fixed sights, 4 and 1/2 inch barrel,
                  22 ounces, double action and a ...

QUICK FLASHES of all the shots Danny fired with the Glock.

- TWO at Big Bill
- FOUR at the guys at the table
- ONE at Garcetti
- THREE  at Tanner

THE KID AGAIN.

                             KID
                  ... and a TEN ROUND magazine ...

ON DANNY.  Still staring at the gun. He knows the gun is empty. He 
notices something on the floor ...

... THE LOADED SYRINGE.

                             KID (cont'd)
                  Or did I say ELEVEN?

Danny trying to remember.

                             KID (cont'd)
                  Which was it, mister?  Was it ten or was it eleven?
                       (beat)
                  Pretty big fucking difference if you ask me.

DANNY starts chuckling. Looks up at Tanner.


                             DANNY
                  It doesn't matter.

Danny looks down at the syringe again.  Tanner sees it too.

                             TANNER
                  Too late to be a hero.

Danny picks up the syringe.

Tanner pulls the trigger.

INSIDE THE GUN - MOVING SLOWLY towards the firing pin as it springs 
forward toward CAMERA with a LOUD CLICK.

THE GUN IS EMPTY.
                             DANNY
                  Ten it is.

Danny jams the SYRINGE INTO TANNER'S THROAT all the way down to the 
plunger, dosing him with the meth.

Tanner goes down, blood bubbling from his throat around the syringe.  
His eyes roll back as he  convulses from the drugs.

Danny struggles to his feet.

Tanner quivers from head to toe like some freaked-out Pentecostal in 
the throws of a holy possession.

Danny pulls the syringe from Tanner's throat.  A LONG WET WEEZE 
ESCAPES.

Suddenly, A NOISE BEHIND DANNY.

Garcetti standing there pointing his gun at Danny, rocking slightly 
back and forth, a bullet hole in his cheekbone.  He looks brain dead.

Danny doesn't move. TANNER STILL WHEEZING.

Garcetti looks like he wants to shoot his gun, but can't.  He keeps 
looking down at his hand, trying to get it to obey.

Danny calmly walks over and takes the gun from Garcetti.

Garcetti puts his hand to his nose and blows out a clot of blood.  He 
looks down at his hand.

He has hacked up the bullet he was shot with.

Garcetti smiles an embarrassed smile at Danny.  TANNER'S WHEEZING 
CONTINUES.

                             DANNY
                       (softly)
                  You're dead.

Garcetti nods slightly.  He goes to a kneeling position, then curls up 
on the floor like he is taking a nap and dies.

Danny goes over to the couch and sits down.

Danny with his head in his hands, emotionally and physically exhausted.  
TANNER WHEEZING LOUDER AND LOUDER.

CLOSE ON DANNY'S FACE.  Blank.  Devoid of anything.  He stuffs 
Garcetti's gun into his own mouth, hand shaking.

He takes the gun out.

Stuffs it back in again, shoving it way down, almost gagging on it.  
The barrel clatters against his teeth. He takes it out again.  THE 
WHEEZING CONTINUES.

Danny starts crying.  Lifts the gun halfway again, then drops it.

He jumps up.  Goes over to the still-wheezing Tanner and empties his 
clip into him.  When the clip is spent, Danny keeps pulling the trigger 
... over and over again.

He stands there pulling the trigger again and again and again and 
again.

                                                          FADE OUT.
                                                          FADE IN:

INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Danny dressed in his "Tom" clothes. He limps over to the bed and picks 
up the trumpet case.  Carries it over to the mirror.

Danny staring at his reflection. He lights a cigarette.

                             DANNY
                  My name is Tom Van Allen. I'm a
                  trumpet player.

Danny smiles.

                             VOICE (O.S.)
                  Nah, you're Danny Flynne.

He turns.

COLETTE and QUINCEY standing there.  Quincey holds a nine millimeter 
with a muzzle suppressor.

                             QUINCEY
                  You're a motherfucking rat.

He shoots Danny in the stomach.  Danny slumps to the floor.  His 
cigarette falls out of his mouth and rolls under the bed.

Colette freaks.

                             COLETTE
                  You said you wouldn't kill him!

She tries to go to Danny but Quincey stops her.

                             COLETTE
                  You lied to me!

                             QUINCEY
                  Oops.  My bad.

Danny looks at them, confused, a blood stain blossoming on his white 
shirt.


                             DANNY
                  Colette, what happened?  Didn't the cops ...

                             QUINCEY
                  The cops came.  But they didn't find
                  nothing.  Turns out their C.I. game
                  'em some bad information.

Quincey holds up the baggie of drugs.

Danny looks from Quincey to Colette.  Colette looks away.

                             QUINCEY (cont'd)
                  You fuck with the Mexicali Boys, this
                  is what you get, homes.

UNDER THE BED - the cigarette smoldering on the carpet.

                             QUINCEY (cont'd)
                  Domingo thought you might be the one
                  who went rat on him.

Quincey looks at Colette

                             QUINCEY (cont'd)
                  So I brought in a rat of my own.

Danny looks at Colette, dumbfounded.

                             DANNY
                  You set me up?

                             QUINCEY
                  Bitch played you like a squeezebox, Romeo.

Danny can't help from laughing at the irony.  Beads of sweat are 
forming on his blanched face.  He looks at Colette with a wry smile.

                             DANNY
                  You're good, princess. I'll give you that.

                             COLETTE
                  Danny, it's not what you think.

Danny looks down at his bloody stomach.

                             COLETTE
                  I owed them money ... a lot of
                  money ... they didn't give me a
                  choice.  You know how it works.  When
                  I got to know you, I tried to back
                  out ... that's when they did this ...
                       (she indicates the bruises)
                  But I told them I wouldn't do it .. I
                  didn't want to see you get hurt.

Danny stares at her, not sure what to believe.  He looks over at 
Quincey.

                             DANNY
                  She selling me a bill, home boy?

Quincey shakes his head.

                             QUINCEY
                  Nah, she ain't lying.  She took a
                  pretty good beating from you, ace. I
                  seen grown men crack after a lot
                  less.  But not this bitch.
                       (beat)
                  It was very touching.

                             DANNY
                  Then why are we here?

                             COLETTE
                  They threatened to kill my daughter.
                       (beat)
                  I had no choice.
                       (beat)
                  I'm sorry, Danny.

Danny looks at Colette, imagining the awful beating she must have 
taken.

                             DANNY
                  It's okay. It's okay.
                       (Danny touches her face.)
                       (beat)
                  God damn, you're beautiful.

UNDER THE BED - THE CARPET IGNITES.  The fire spreads quickly.

                             QUINCEY
                  Jesus.

Quincey grabs her arm.

                             QUINCEY (cont'd)
                  Let's go.

                             COLETTE
                  No!

The drapes go up in flames.  Quincey puts the gun to the back of her 
head.

                             QUINCEY
                  You wanna die here with him or come with me?


                             DANNY
                  Colette, go.

                             COLETTE
                  I don't want to leave you.

                             DANNY
                  Your daughter needs you.  Go.

The fire continues to spread.  Colette kisses Danny on the lips.  
Quincey pulls her away.

Collette looks back one last time just as the flames reach the door, 
cutting off any escape.

Danny breathing hard. He gets up.  Staggers over to the mirror where 
his trumpet is.

He opens the case and takes the trumpet out.

He plops down on the bed and BLOWS A FEW NOTES. He stops for a second, 
a smile on his lips.

He starts to play SAETA.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

INT. BURNING ROOM - NIGHT

Back to the opening scene.  The whole room ablaze.  Danny lying on the 
bed, playing the horn.

                             DANNY (V.O.)
                  So what is it?  Who am I after it's
                  all said and done?

Pieces of the roof start falling in.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Tom Van Allen or Danny Flynne?
                       (beat)
                  Avenging angel or plain old Judas?

He stops playing.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                       (weakly)
                  You decide, friend.  You decide.

He closes his eyes.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  I'm too tired ... so you decide.

He drops his trumpet and lays his head back.

                                                      CUT TO:

BLACK SCREEN

THEN BLURRY, VAGUE SLOW MOTION - moving through the flames.

CLOSE ON DANNY'S HEAD - seemingly floating through the fiery room.

                             DANNY (V.O.)
                  Oh shit. What is this?

Emerging from the flames into a dark hallway.

Danny's eyes flutter as he seemingly continues to float.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Am I dead?

A linoleum floor rushes underneath.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Linoleum.  This must be hell.

Danny head sags, finds himself staring at ...

...  A TATTOED LIKENESS OF HIMSELF.  The tattoo smiles and speaks.

                             TATTO
                       (warped, distorted)
                  Hang in there buddy.

Stairs rush by underneath.  Then another hallway.

DANNY'S P.O.V.  - a bright white light at the end of the hall.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Oh no.  What a fucking cliché.

On Danny's face, floating through the hall.  His eyes fluttering.

MOVING TOWARDS the light.  Closer.  Closer.

Danny's eyes close, his head droops.

                                                          FADE TO WHITE:


CLOSE ON DANNY as his eyes flutter and open.

DANNY'S P.O.V. - an image slowly coming into focus ...

... JIMMY staring down at him with concern.

Danny blinks his eyes again.  Looks up at ...

... A PARAMEDIC working on him.

Danny smiles a weak smile at Jimmy.

Jimmy just sits there, nodding his head, a big shit-eating grin on his 
face.

The paramedic continues to work on Danny.  His eyes slowly close.

                                                          FADE OUT.
                                                          FADE IN:

EXT. THE CITY - DAY

Danny exits a cab and heads towards a coffee shop.  He looks like a new 
man.

                             DANNY (V.O.)
                  Well, I've had some time to think
                  about it and it's pretty simple after
                  all.  I guess it's like the man said -
                  "Man is the measure of all things."
                  I should know.  I ran the gamut.
                  Avenging Angel, Judas, loving
                  husband, prodigal son, prince of
                  Denmark.  I was all of those things.
                       (beat)
                  Tom Van Allen got his revenge.
                  Good for Tom.  And Danny Flynne? He
                  got gut-shot for being the low-life
                  rat that he was.  Sucks for him.
                       (beat)
                  But as far as I'm concerned, they're both dead.

Danny looks through the window of the shop.

Colette inside, working the counter, pouring coffee.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  But what about this guy? Who is he?

Danny enters the shop.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  To tell you the truth, I don't know yet.

INT. COFFE SHOP - SAME

Danny takes a seat at the counter.  Colette turns and sees him.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  But I like his chances.

They stare at one another for a beat, then smile.  Colette pours him 
some coffee.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  I really like his chances.

They strike up a conversation as we ...

                                                          FADE OUT. 

THE END
SAW

                                  James Wan & Leigh Whannell


 
               Darkness.

               The soft sound of moving water can be heard in the background. 
               From the top of the screen a tiny, floating light moves its way 
               downwards across the screen. As it passes, we see just under 
               the water part of a young mans face. His eyes are closed. The 
               light disappears, and across the darkness appears the title S 
               A W. The title fades away.
 
               The tiny light appears again, this time floating down at the 
               end of a tub of water, just near someones bare foot. The camera 
               cuts again to the face of the young man underwater. This is ADAM. 
               Suddenly, his eyes fly open and he comes to life, opening his 
               mouth and gasping for air. As he wakes up and struggles within 
               the bathtub, we see his foot catch on a drain plug, unplugging 
               it. The water starts to drain, and we see go with the water the 
               tiny light, which we can also see has some kind of key attached 
               to it. The room itself is pitch black, but we can still just 
               barely make him out in the dark. Adam lifts himself out of the 
               tub and falls onto the floor, coughing and gasping from the shock. 
               He manages to get to his feet, but as he moves forward he realizes 
               that his ankle is chained to something. He feels his way over 
               to a pipe in the corner, reaching down and pulling at his chain 
               that is attached to it. He cries out, his voice frantic, frightened, 
               and a bit hysterical.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Help! Someone help me! (He stops when 
                         he hears a loud dragging sound somewhere 
                         in the room. He looks out into the darkness 
                         and calls out.) Is someone there? Hey! 
                         (He turns back to the corner to which 
                         he is chained, says in a slightly softer 
                         but still panicked voice) Shit, Im 
                         probably dead.
 
               Suddenly, from out within the darkness comes a mans low, raspy 
               voice. It startles Adam. The voice, we will soon learn, belongs 
               to LAWRENCE.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Youre not dead.

               Adam quickly turns in the direction of the voice. Holding his 
               arms out for balance, he tries to look across the room to whoever 
               is speaking, but still cannot see a thing.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Whos that? Whos that?!

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (his voice strangely a bit on the calm 
                         side, and almost irritated with Adams 
                         reaction to the situation. This shall 
                         be his tone for many scenes to come.) 
                         Theres no point in yelling, I already 
                         tried it.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Turn on the lights!

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Would if I could.

                                     ADAM
                         What the fuck is going on? Where am 
                         I? (He turns into his corner, touching 
                         the wall.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         I dont know yet.

                                     ADAM
                         (smelling something; in disgust) What 
                         is that smell?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Shh! Hang on a second, I think I found 
                         something.
 
               With a loud click and an even louder buzzing sound, the very 
               bright fluorescent lights come to life, lighting up in rows, 
               starting from Lawrences end and moving towards Adam. As they 
               come on, Adam is nearly blinded by the sudden change from pitch 
               black to bright white and squints in pain, holding up his arms 
               to cover his face. In the light we now see that he is in his 
               mid-twenties, with short brown hair, wearing a dark blue striped 
               shirt over a white tee shirt and jeans, looking like a drowned 
               rat from the tub. It takes him a moment but his eyes finally 
               start to adjust, and he looks around the room. He and we see 
               Lawrence, who also winces from the glare of the lights, standing 
               by the light switch and the door. He is on the opposite end of 
               the room, also chained to a pipe in the corner by his foot. He 
               wears a blue button-down dress shirt, now soaked with sweat stains. 
               He is middle aged, mid to late forties, with pale blonde hair 
               and even paler skin. Dark circles are under his eyes. Both men 
               are barefoot.
 
               Lawrences eyes adjust to the light and he sees across the room. 
               Then, his gaze starts towards the center of the room, as does 
               Adams, who steps forward as much as he can, a look of horror 
               on his face. We see lying face down the body of a man who has 
               blown his brains out, lying in a pool of blood, clad in only 
               boxer shorts and a tee shirt. In his left hand is a gun, in his 
               right hand is a micro cassette recorder. A gunshot and a scream 
               are heard as the camera moves up and in a fast 360° angle above 
               and circling the man, ending in a full overhead view of him.
 
               
               The shot cuts to Adam, who reels in shock and disgust.

                                     ADAM
                         Holy shit!

               He turns towards the tub and leans over, gagging and coughing. 
               Lawrence in the meantime hops forward the best he can, studying 
               the body with a look of fear and concern. Adam stops coughing 
               and turns back around, takes another look at the body and around 
               the room. He looks down at his chain then starts to completely 
               freak out, grabbing and pulling at his chain.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (screaming) HELP!!! (He falls back onto 
                         his bottom on the floor as he yanks 
                         at the chain as hard as he can.) HELP!!! 
                         Help!
 
               Lawrence just stands and watches him with an almost embarrassed, 
               appalled look at his behaviour. It seems that Lawrence, despite 
               being in the situation hes in, is above that kind of uncontrolled 
               reaction. He speaks a bit coldly.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         No one can hear you.

               Adam stops pulling at the chain, stands up and looks to Lawrence, 
               his breathing fast and heavy. His voice is not yelling anymore 
               but still just as hysterical.
 
                                     ADAM
                         What the fuck is this?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Calm down, just calm down. (He knows 
                         that to remain calm is to remain in 
                         control, something he must be no matter 
                         what the situation.) Are you hurt?
 
                         
               Adam looks down at himself, shrugging slightly.

                                     ADAM
                         I dont know...yeah!

               Lawrence moves over to the pipe in the corner, leaning against 
               it for support.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (calmly) Whats your name?

                                     ADAM
                         (sarcastic) My name is Very Fucking 
                         Confused! (demanding) Whats your name? 
                         Whats going on here?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (internal eye roll; hes getting more 
                         and more aggravated with Adams behaviour) 
                         My name is Lawrence Gordon, Im a doctor. 
                         I just woke up here, just like you. 
                         (He reaches up, wipes his face with 
                         his sleeve)
 
               Adam kneels back down facing the pipe, pulling at his chains 
               once more, but not with his prior panic. He winces at the metal 
               biting into his skin.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (in pain) Ah!

               Lawrence looks at Adam with a look that seems to say Im stuck 
               in here with THIS guy? He then glances down at the body.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Recognize him?

               Adam continues to pull at his chains, does not and will not look 
               at the body, just shakes his head.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (sharply) No.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (trying to get SOMETHING out of this 
                         kid) Well, do you have any idea how 
                         you got here?
 
                                     ADAM
                         No.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Whats the last thing you remember?
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         Nothing. (he sits back onto the floor, 
                         stops pulling at his chains for a moment.) 
                         I went to bed in my shithole apartment, 
                         and woke up in an actual shithole. (He 
                         raises his left leg slightly, starts 
                         trying to pull his foot out of the iron 
                         cuff. He glances to Lawrence, who has 
                         moved over to the wall to his left, 
                         bent over slightly and resting a hand 
                         against a pipe.) So what about you, 
                         huh?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (He shrugs slightly, shaking his head.) 
                         Well theres...theres not much to tell, 
                         really. (Across the room, Adam gives 
                         up with the chain for the time being 
                         but remains sitting on the floor.) I 
                         was on my way home from work and uh, 
                         I dont remember anything else.
 
               Adam just sits there, glancing over to the body and then focusing 
               on it much more. The initial panic has worn off for now, replaced 
               simply with fear and shock. His voice is a bit softer.
 
                                     ADAM
                         First dead body Ive ever seen. Look 
                         different in real life. They dont move.
 
                         
               Lawrence slowly lowers himself into a sitting position against 
               the wall. He pokes slightly at the iron cuff around his foot.
 
               
                                     LAWRENCE
                         From the looks of these chains, someone 
                         didnt want us to go very far either.
 
                         
               Suddenly, Adam leaps up, lifting up his shirt and exposing his 
               abdomen. His panic is back, but not at full force like before. 
               He studies himself then glances to Lawrence.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Can you see any scars?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (looking at him strangely) What?

                                     ADAM
                         Huh? This is what they do man, (he gestures 
                         to his stomach, where there are in fact 
                         no scars.) They kidnap you and drug 
                         you and before you know it, youre in 
                         a bathtub and your kidneys are on eBay. 
                         (A ridiculous theory to us and to Lawrence, 
                         but Adam states it with conviction.)
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (a scoffing tone in his voice) No one 
                         has taken your kidneys.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (disbelief) How can you tell from way 
                         over there?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (matter of fact) Because youd either 
                         be in terrible agony, or youd be dead 
                         by now. Trust me.
 
                                     ADAM
                         What are you, a surgeon? (He lowers 
                         his shirt and turns and bends down to 
                         prod at the chain around the pipe again.)
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Yeah. (He sighs. Hes getting tired 
                         of Adam already. He speaks sharply.) 
                         So, you gonna tell me your name, or 
                         what?
 
               Adam stands back up, turns to Lawrence, his voice once again 
               calm.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Adam.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (getting to his feet, his voice a bit 
                         calmer) Well Adam, what we need to do 
                         (he leans with one hand outstretched 
                         against the pipe to his right. Adam 
                         watches him, scared but calm) is start 
                         thinking about why were here. Whoever 
                         brought us there couldve killed us 
                         by now. But they didnt. They must want 
                         something from us. (He looks up and 
                         around the room) Question is what. (He 
                         sees something up on the wall, moves 
                         forwards a bit towards it. We see that 
                         it is a brand new clock on the wall, 
                         ticking away. It reads currently at 
                         10:22.) That clock.
 
                                     ADAM
                         What about it?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Its brand new. (squints, studying it)
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (not getting what hes implying) So?
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (sighs; its quite simple, why cant 
                         Adam see it?) So, someone obviously 
                         wanted us to know the time. (Adam looks 
                         a bit confused still, mulls over that 
                         information. Lawrence thinks for a moment.) 
                         Wait, I think I may be able to reach 
                         that door.
 
               Lawrence moves over as far as the chain will allow him to the 
               giant, wooden sliding door, pushing against it as hard as he 
               can. In the meantime, we see Adam thinking. He pauses, then reaches 
               down and starts going through his pockets. There is nothing in 
               the front two, but in his back left pocket he pulls out a plastic 
               baggie with a white envelope in it. He unfolds the baggie; the 
               envelope says ADAM. He stares at it in his hands, wondering what 
               it is.
 
               Lawrence continues struggling with the door, quickly glances 
               over his shoulder to see what Adam is doing. He sees Adam holding 
               the baggie. Adam reaches into the envelope, pulls out a micro 
               cassette tape. A close up shows the words Play Me written on 
               the tape label. Adam holds it in his hand, studying it. Lawrence 
               turns away from the door, looking over and trying to see what 
               Adam has in his hand.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         What is that? (Adam doesnt answer, 
                         continues looking at the tape. Lawrences 
                         voice grows impatient.) Excuse me.
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (glances up briefly at Lawrence, then 
                         back down at the tape. His voice sounds 
                         slightly surprised.) Its a tape.
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Where did you find it?

                                     ADAM
                         It was in my pocket.

               Lawrence thinks about that briefly then starts digging through 
               his own pockets, finds within them a white envelope with LAWRENCE 
               written across it in the same black lettering as Adams.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (regarding his tape) It says Play me.
 
                         
               Lawrence tears into his envelope, empties the contents into the 
               palm of his hand. First, he holds up a similar tape to Adams. 
               It also says Play Me. Then he holds up a single bullet, studying 
               it, not sure what its there for yet. Then, he holds up a tiny 
               key. He bends over, gets down on the floor and starts to try 
               to unlock his chains with the key. It doesnt seem to be working.
 
               
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (frustrated, mumbling to himself and 
                         to the key) Come on, come on, come on....
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (seeing that it doesnt seem to be working 
                         on Lawrences lock) Throw it over here.
 
                         
               Lawrence gives him a slightly mistrustful look, but then holds 
               up the key and throws it. Adam misses the key at first as it 
               hits the floor in front of the dirty toilet near his corner.
 
               
                                     ADAM
                         Fuck. (He leans over and picks up the 
                         key, then bends down and tries the key 
                         on the lock on his ankle, which doesnt 
                         work. He tries the lock on the chains 
                         around the pipe. It isnt working there 
                         either.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (watching him) No?

               Adam gives up, drops the key onto the floor frustratedly, shaking 
               his head. Thats when he looks over to the body again, and the 
               shot closes up on the hand holding the tape recorder. A small 
               loop handle juts out of the hands grip. Adam stands up, then 
               bends down and picks up the tape on the floor, looking at it. 
               He puts it back down then stretches himself flat out on the floor, 
               trying to reach. Unfortunately, there is still a good three to 
               four feet between him and the body.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Use your shirt.

                                     ADAM
                         (gets back up to his knees) What?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Your shirt.

               Adam looks down at himself, then takes off the long sleeved blue 
               shirt. He lays back down, holding the shirt by the ends of each 
               sleeve, and throws it, trying to catch it on the tape recorder. 
               It misses. He tries a second time; same result.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Come on...

               Adam tries again; it misses. It is just barely reaching. He pulls 
               the shirt back, gets back up on his knees, aggravated.
 
                                     ADAM
                         It wont work.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (trying to get him to not give up yet) 
                         Well, look around, there must be something 
                         else you can use.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (stands, ready to give up, skeptical) 
                         Theres nothing.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (insistent) Well there must be something!
 
                         
               Adam looks around his area, then into the bathtub. He sees something, 
               bends over, takes out the tub plug, which is attached to a long 
               cord. He ties the cord around the sleeve of his shirt. He kneels 
               down, holding out the shirt, aiming.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Come on, you can do it.

               Adam throws it, attempting to get the plug through the loop at 
               the end of the tape recorder. He misses.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Come on, come on, again.

               He tries again and misses. On the third try, however, he gets 
               the plug right through the loop. Lawrence smiles in relief. Adam 
               very slowly pulls it back, dragging the tape recorder along the 
               floor towards him. He picks it up, getting rid of the plug and 
               dropping it and the shirt on the floor. He picks up the tape, 
               pops it in and presses play, holding the tape recorder out a 
               bit so that they can both hear, but keeping his head tilted so 
               he can hear better. A chilling deep, raspy, sinister male voice 
               The Jigsaw Killer comes from the tape. As it speaks, Adams expression 
               is fearful, but the thought How does he know? can be detected.
 
               
                                     JIGSAW
                         (on tape) Rise and shine, Adam. Youre 
                         probably wondering where you are. Ill 
                         tell you where you might be. You might 
                         be in the room that you die in. Up until 
                         now, you simply sat in the shadows, 
                         watching others live out their lives. 
                         But what do voyeurs see when they look 
                         into the mirror? Now, I see you as a 
                         strange mix of someone angry and yet 
                         apathetic. But mostly just pathetic. 
                         So are you going to watch yourself die 
                         today, Adam? Or do something about it? 
                         (end)
 
               Adam looks frightened but not sure of the entire meaning of the 
               message.
 
                                     ADAM
                         I dont get it. (He presses the stop 
                         button on the tape.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (eagerly, gestures.) Throw me the player.
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (pauses, thinks) No, you throw me your 
                         tape.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (a heavy sigh. He looks at Adam as a 
                         slow-minded fool who simply doesnt 
                         understand the full capacity of the 
                         situation that theyre in, and speaks 
                         to him as such.) Look, were going to 
                         have to work together if we want to 
                         get out of here. Now just throw it to 
                         me.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (picks up on the tone, speaks defensively) 
                         Im not going to risk breaking it! You 
                         throw me your tape!
 
               Lawrence pauses, looking at Adam as though hed like to smack 
               him, then holds up and tosses the tape. It hits the floor behind 
               Adam, who kneels down and picks it up, pops it in, presses play. 
               Its the same chilling voice as on Adams tape. As the tape plays, 
               Adam stares at Lawrence, and Lawrence at the tape recorder.
 
               
                                     JIGSAW
                         (on tape) Dr. Gordon, this is your wake 
                         up call. Every day of your working life, 
                         you have given people the news that 
                         they are going to die soon. Now you 
                         will be the cause of death. Your aim 
                         in this game is to kill Adam. (Adam 
                         glances down at the tape recorder wide-eyed, 
                         then back up at Lawrence) You have until 
                         six on the clock to do it. There sa 
                         man in the room with you. When theres 
                         that much poison in your blood (another 
                         view of the body from Lawrences POV), 
                         the only thing left to do is shoot yourself. 
                         (Jigsaw coughs) There are ways to win 
                         this hidden all around you. Just remember: 
                         X marks the spot for the treasure. If 
                         you do not kill Adam by 6:00, then Alison 
                         and Diana will die, Dr. Gordon. And 
                         Ill leave you in this room to rot. 
                         Let the game begin. (end)
 
               The looks on each mans face clearly say Oh Shit. The tape ends. 
               Lawrence stands up.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (firmly) Give me that. Now. (Adam tosses 
                         him the tape. He catches it, rewinds, 
                         plays back. Adam stands up from his 
                         spot on the floor.)
 
                                     JIGSAW
                         (on tape)...then Alison and Diana will 
                         die, Dr. Gordon. And Ill leave you 
                         in this room to rot.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (thinking, trying to figure this out) 
                         Any idea who that is?
 
                                     JIGSAW
                         (on tape) Let the game begin.

                                     ADAM
                         He knows us.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Wait a minute. (rewinds more)

                                     ADAM
                         (false hope) What do you think? Probably 
                         a joke, right?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Shh, shh! (presses play)

                                     JIGSAW
                         (on tape) Let the game begin.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (softly) Listen...

                                     JIGSAW
                         (on tape, in a VERY hushed tone after 
                         a brief silence)...Follow your heart.
 
                         
               Lawrence stops the tape.

                                     ADAM
                         What the hell does Follow your heart 
                         mean?
 
               Lawrence is looking around, on the walls and everywhere else 
               in the bathroom for a heart. He spots a small one drawn in brown 
               on the toilet next to Adam and points.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         There! Right next to you, on the toilet.
 
                         
               Adam looks, sees the toilet. Slowly, he bends down, resting his 
               hands on the seat, looking down into the bowl of liquid shit, 
               not really sure what hes looking for.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (impatient, gesturing) Come on, come 
                         on.
 
               Adam glances up at Lawrence with a look of Youve got to be kidding 
               me, but Lawrence watches him expectantly. Adam sighs, then reaches 
               in with his right hand, fishing around in the mess.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Oh man...(he gasps, making gagging sounds, 
                         his face turned away from the bowl. 
                         He coughs, fishes around for another 
                         brief moment, then quickly pulls back, 
                         trying to shake some of the shit off 
                         of his hand, spitting.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (expectantly) Anything?

                                     ADAM
                         (disgusted) No solids.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Take off the lid. (He points to the 
                         lid. Adam looks to it, slowly stands 
                         up, reaches for it. Lawrence has no 
                         patience.) Come on!
 
               Adam takes off the lid, places it down on the toilet seat. The 
               water is clearer inside, and he reaches in and pulls out something 
               wrapped up in a black garbage bag. He holds it up for Lawrence 
               to see, turns to him.
 
                                     ADAM
                         I really wish I had checked in there 
                         first.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Huh. (he smiles slightly) What is it?
 
                         
               Adam tears into the bag, reaches in and pulls out two hacksaws. 
               He drops the bag on the floor, bends down and takes up his chain, 
               holding one of the hacksaws and beginning to saw at the chain 
               with it. Lawrence watches him for a moment.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Hey! (Adam turns and looks. Lawrence 
                         speaks in an irritated voice) Mind passing 
                         me the other one?
 
               Adam reaches over and picks up the other hacksaw, then carefully 
               throws it across the room. It hits the pipe to Lawrences left. 
               Lawrence reaches down and picks it up, then sits down on the 
               floor. Quick shot back to Adam, who, while Lawrence is preoccupied 
               with picking up the hacksaw, quickly picks up the garbage bag 
               and tosses it into the bathtub. Both men start to saw away at 
               their chains furiously, but neither are making any progress. 
               Suddenly, Adams saw snaps in the middle, and his temper flares.
 
               
                                     ADAM
                         (enraged) Fuck! Fuck! (He reacts violently, 
                         hitting the broken saw twice against 
                         the iron pipe then turns and hums it 
                         across the room, right into a mirror. 
                         A small piece of the mirror breaks off 
                         and flies to the floor.)
 
               Lawrence glances over at what Adam has done, then goes back to 
               sawing for another moment. Adam sits back down, breathing heavily, 
               leaning against the pipe in his corner. Finally, Lawrence gives 
               up, turning and sitting with his back against the pipe, also 
               breathing heavily for a moment. He sits there, when a look of 
               realization comes across his face. He holds up the saw, looking 
               at it, understanding. He lowers it to the floor, shaking his 
               head slightly.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (everything is becoming more clear now) 
                         He doesnt want us to cut through our 
                         chains. He wants us to cut through our 
                         feet. (Adam looks up at him, eyebrows 
                         raised.) I think I may know whos done 
                         this to us.
 
                                     ADAM
                         What did you say? (he stands up; is 
                         Lawrence hiding something from him?)
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Its not someone I know personally. 
                         Its...just someone I know of.

                         (getting slightly frantic again) Jesus 
                         Christ! Tell me, who is it?!
 
               The camera closes up on Lawrences face. To the right of it, 
               the screen is fading into a flashback of a crime scene. As Lawrence 
               speaks, his face fades and the flashback scene grows clearer, 
               until it is only the crime scene, with three detectives walking 
               down a flight of stairs.

                         The last I heard...the police still 
                         hadnt caught him.
 
               
               We now see the three figures descending through a trap door down 
               a flight of stairs. The lighting is a bright lime green that 
               is strangely dark at the same time. The trio enters a small, 
               cell like room with a low ceiling. They are TAPP, SING, and KERRY. 
               Tapp is a tall black man in his late forties-early fifties. Sing 
               is an Asian man in his mid to late thirties, and Kerry is a Caucasian 
               woman in her mid to late thirties with long, curly brown hair 
               that is tied back in a ponytail. All are well dressed, Sing and 
               Tapp in suits, the woman in a jacket and dress slacks. They are 
               the detectives working on this case.
 
               As they move into the room, Sing sees something that brings a 
               look of shock to his face, shining a flashlight on it. We cannot 
               see it yet.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (VO) And the only reason I know that 
                         is because I was a suspect.
 
               Tapp comes into the room last, ducking slightly from his height, 
               and comes up alongside Sing, looking at the same thing.

                         (VO) Ill start from the beginning.
 
                         
                                     KERRY
                         This ones not fresh anymore. At least 
                         three weeks out. (Detective Tapp squints 
                         as he peers in and studies the body) 
                         Victims a 46-year old male. (Quick 
                         flash of a crime scene photo, a closeup 
                         of behind the mans head and upper back. 
                         There are deep cuts all over. The camera 
                         cuts upwards to the detectives.) Died 
                         of massive blood loss. Mostly through 
                         the femoral artery. (The camera pans 
                         around to Detective Tapp, who moves 
                         around the side fo the cage to get a 
                         better look inside, shining his flashlight 
                         in.) He started at the back of the cage 
                         and tunneled his way through the razor 
                         wire so fast its amazing he got as 
                         far as he did. Cut himself so deep, 
                         we found traces of stomach acid on the 
                         floor. (Another more gruesome crime 
                         scene photo shot of the body from the 
                         side; we can see the razor wire digging 
                         in under his arm. Also, a close-up shot 
                         of some of his wounds; long, deep cuts.) 
                         We also found this. (She holds up an 
                         evidence baggie with a micro cassette 
                         tape recorder, just like the one Adam 
                         and Lawrence found in their cell. She 
                         presses the play button, and Tapp and 
                         Sing listen. Its the same chilling 
                         voice from Adam and Lawrences tapes.)

                         (on tape) Hello Paul. You are a perfectly 
                         healthy, sane, middle-class male. Yet 
                         last month, you ran a straight razor 
                         across your wrists. Did you cut yourself 
                         because you truly wanted to die, or 
                         did you just want some attention? Tonight, 
                         youll show me. The irony is that if 
                         you want to die, you just have to stay 
                         where you are. But if you want to live, 
                         youll have to cut yourself again. (Flashback 
                         shot of Paul waking up in the cage, 
                         looking around, scared and confused. 
                         The shots go back and forth between 
                         the detectives and the Paul flashback, 
                         with him grabbing and shaking the razor 
                         wire, screaming. His screams sound distant 
                         under Jigsaws voice.) Find the path 
                         through the razor wire to the door. 
                         But hurry. At 3:00 that door will lock 
                         and then this room becomes your tomb. 
                         How much blood will you shed to stay 
                         alive, Paul? (end)
 
                                     KERRY
                         (stopping the tape) The door was on 
                         a timer. It was unlocked until 3:00. 
                         Then it slammed shut. He was given two 
                         hours.
 
               Cut back to Detective Tapp, who notices something and shines 
               his light on it. We see a strange wound on Pauls body, a piece 
               of flesh carved out into the shape of a jigsaw piece.
 
                                     TAPP
                         Jigsaw piece. (Sing looks in as well, 
                         see it. There is a quick flash of crime 
                         scene photos showing a close up of the 
                         wound. Tapp sighs.) I think were gonna 
                         be here for a while, Sing. (Sing looks 
                         to him. We get another quick crime scene 
                         shot of Paul.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (VO) The newspapers started calling 
                         him the Jigsaw Killer.
 
               Cut back to Lawrence in the bathroom. For his next two spoken 
               lines, the shot switches back and forth between him and the detectives 
               in the razor wire room.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Actually, technically speaking, hes 
                         not really a murderer. He never killed 
                         anyone.
 
               Sing, wearing gloves, gets in the cage and examines Pauls body 
               a bit. A flash of another crime scene photo of the wound with 
               a ruler held up to it is shown. More gruesome crime scene photos 
               of that and other wounds are flashed across the screen.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (VO) He finds ways for his victims to 
                         kill themselves.
 
               Cut to Sing kneeled down over a charred corpse, completely blackened, 
               at another crime scene. We hear Jigsaws voice from a tape recorder 
               play over the scene as the detectives look around, and over the 
               flashback shots.
 
                                     JIGSAW
                         (VO, on tape) Hello Mark. If youre 
                         so sick, then why do I have so many 
                         photos of you up and about? (there is 
                         a quick montage of a camera snapping 
                         several black and white shots of Mark 
                         up and about, looking around and getting 
                         into a car.) Lets put your so-called 
                         illness to the test. (Flashback image 
                         of Mark waking up. He is a younger man 
                         in his mid to late twenties, with dark 
                         brown hair. He is completely nude, smeared 
                         in some kind of Vaseline-like ointment. 
                         In front of him is a small, square glass 
                         plate held up by some chains. On the 
                         plate is a micro cassette player, a 
                         lit votive candle, and a box of matches. 
                         He gets up, looking around confusedly 
                         and scared.) Right now, there is a slow-acting 
                         poison in your veins. The antidote is 
                         in the safe. (Black and white crime 
                         scene shot of the safe, then a shot 
                         of Mark standing over it, screaming, 
                         his screams distant under Jigsaws voice, 
                         as with Paul.) The combination to the 
                         safe (quick montage of several black 
                         and white crime-scene photos of numbers 
                         written all over the walls) is written 
                         on the wall. Hurry up and program it 
                         in. But watch your step (Marks bare 
                         foot steps on the broken glass scattered 
                         all across the floor). And by the way, 
                         thats a flammable substance smeared 
                         on your body (shot of Mark looking at 
                         the ointment on his hand, up his arm, 
                         everywhere), so I would be careful with 
                         that candle, if I were you...
 
                                     MARK
                         (huddled over the safe; screams, but 
                         it is still distant sounding) Help!!!!!
 
                         
                                     JIGSAW
                         (VO ctd)....or all the people youve 
                         burned with your act (Mark starts to 
                         turn the lock on the safe) just might 
                         have their revenge.
 
               We see Mark desperately going around the room, holding the candle, 
               looking at the walls, trying to find a combination. The camera 
               goes back and forth a few times in a sped-up shot to him doing 
               this and turning a the lock on the safe, trying to program the 
               combination into the safe. He moves in a circle, clockwise to 
               us. When he gets to facing right in front of us, the flame from 
               the candle flares up and engulfs the shot, flaring into a close-up 
               crime scene photo of Marks charred face.
 
               The shot moves back to the trio of detectives, with Sing holding 
               the tape recorder.
 
                                     KERRY
                         I found something else. Well, two things, 
                         actually. (She moves past them and we 
                         go with her over to a wall where there 
                         is a small hole cut, about an inch or 
                         two in diameter. The light from the 
                         outside shines in.) There was someone 
                         standing outside here watching through 
                         this peephole. Looks like our friend 
                         Jigsaw likes to book himself front row 
                         seats to his own sick little games. 
                         He was there at the last one as well. 
                         (She walks over to Sing and Tapp) Only 
                         this time, he left us his penlight. 
                         (She holds up the penlight in an evidence 
                         baggie, clicking it twice then handing 
                         it to Tapp.)
 
                                     TAPP
                         (taking the baggie, studying it) Get 
                         a rush on the prints. (He hands it back 
                         to her.)
 
                                     KERRY
                         (taking the baggie, moving out of the 
                         room) Copy that.

                         Hospital room. Lawrence in his white 
                         doctors coat along with three blue-scrub 
                         clad medical students. A nurse in white 
                         stands off to the side. Lawrence is 
                         going over the patients charts. He 
                         goes over to the x-ray display, pushing 
                         the light on to view two x-rays of someones 
                         skull. He points to it with his pen 
                         as he speaks.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Okay. This patient has an inoperable 
                         frontal lobe tumor extending across 
                         the midline. Started as colon cancer. 
                         (He turns back to the three young medical 
                         students. One of them, a pretty Asian 
                         girl named CARLA, smiles at Lawrence 
                         as he speaks, seems particularly infatuated 
                         with him.) The patient has come in for 
                         a standard checkup by which we are able 
                         to monitor the rate at which his condition 
                         is declining.
 
               In the doorway, an orderly pushing a cart of cleaning supplies 
               is passing by and stops when he sees Lawrence and the medical 
               students in the room, listening to what Lawrence is saying. This 
               is Zep. Hes a man in his early to late forties dressed in orderly 
               whites with short brown hair and large blue eyes that show a 
               kindness that the others in the room seem to be lacking. Kindness, 
               and something else below the surface. He glances down at John 
               sleeping, then up at Lawrence.

                                     ZEP
                         (cutting him off) His name is John, 
                         Dr. Gordon. (He looks down at the patient, 
                         who we see is a man in his late forties-early 
                         fifties, hairless except for a small 
                         white goatee. His head is to the side 
                         and he is sleeping. On the tray table 
                         in front of him is a notebook and some 
                         colored pencils. As Zep looks at him 
                         and speaks of him, there is caring in 
                         his voice, something Dr. Gordon has 
                         yet to display regarding this patient.) 
                         Hes a very interesting person.
 
               Lawrence looks almost slightly embarrassed, not for himself but 
               maybe for Zep. A condescending, smug smile plays across his face 
               and he nods. His tone matches his look.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Thank you for that information, Zep. 
                         (he looks to the students, who all share 
                         his smug smile) As you can see, our 
                         orderlies form very special bonds with 
                         the patients. (Zep just stares at Lawrence, 
                         his expression mostly blank but with 
                         pure loathing just underneath the surface. 
                         The look seems to say Fuck you, Dr. 
                         Gordon. He stares at him for a moment, 
                         then turns away, and continues down 
                         the hall with his cart.) Continuing 
                         on, the patient....
 
               But he is cut off by a voice on the intercom.

                                     INTERCOM
                         Dr. Gordon, Dr. Lawrence Gordon, please 
                         page the operator.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (a smug but annoyed smirk) Obviously 
                         someone doesnt want me to tell you 
                         what the patient has. Excuse me. (He 
                         steps around the students, leaves the 
                         room. The three students watch after 
                         him with great admiration.)
 
               Cut to Lawrences office at the hospital . Inside, Tapp is leaning 
               against Dr. Gordons chair, studying the various framed degrees 
               on the wall. Sing is sitting in one of the two chairs across 
               from the desk, twisted around in his seat to look at a couple 
               of small picture frames on the bookshelf behind him. Lawrence 
               opens the door and enters, and the two detectives turn to look 
               at him. He removes his white coat and hangs it on a rack by the 
               door. Tapp speaks first, his tone is friendly, but searching.
 
               
                                     TAPP
                         Dr. Gordon, Im Detective Tapp, this 
                         is Detective Sing, City Homicide. (he 
                         gestures to the degrees on the wall.) 
                         Very impressive.
 
               Lawrence smiles, pretending to care about what they think, truly 
               just wanting to get this over with so as to not waste any more 
               of his time. As he speaks, he walks over to the chair behind 
               his desk.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Oh. Thank you, I do my best. (He sits 
                         in his chair. Tapp takes the seat next 
                         to Sing across from him. Sing studies 
                         him silently, chewing gum.)
 
                                     TAPP
                         Sorry to interrupt you while youre 
                         working.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Thats fine. Now, how can I help you 
                         gentlemen?
 
               Tapps tone turns a bit more serious, but still amiable enough.
 
               
                                     TAPP
                         Are you able to tell us where you were 
                         between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 
                         1:00 a.m. last night, Doctor?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (his tone just barely masking his concern) 
                         Why is it that youre interested?
 
                         
                                     TAPP
                         Wed like to ask you a few questions 
                         about it. For your sake, I think its 
                         best if we do it down at the station. 
                         Would you like to follow us there?
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (Shaking his head, this is unbelievable) 
                         No, Im afraid thats...thats quite 
                         out of the question. I cant just leave, 
                         I have work to do. Plus, my wife has 
                         the car today, so...
 
                                     SING
                         (amiable but hinting that he knows something) 
                         Oh, thats okay, you can ride with us. 
                         Doc.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (chuckles uncomfortably) Im sorry, 
                         youll have to tell me again. What is 
                         this all about?
 
               Tapp produces the penlight from his pocket, holds it up for Dr. 
               Gordon.
 
                                     TAPP
                         Is this yours, Doctor?

               He puts the penlight down on the desk. Lawrence picks it up, 
               a brief oh shit look flashing across his face only to be quickly 
               covered up. He looks at the pen strangely. The two detectives 
               carefully study his reaction. Lawrence looks back up at them.
 
               
               Cut to the Police Station. In an interrogation room, Lawrence 
               paces back and forth nervously, now wearing his suit jacket. 
               His lawyer sits at the table, taking notes.
 
                                     LAWYER
                         So you have no idea how your penlight 
                         showed up at the murder scene?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Of course not!

                                     LAWYER
                         I have to ask. What were you doing last 
                         night.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (a slight hesitation, a bit of guilt 
                         in his voice. As much as he would allow.) 
                         I was seeing someone.
 
                                     LAWYER
                         (a slight pause) Who? (Lawrence doesnt 
                         answer, just continues his pacing. The 
                         lawyer gets frustrated, noisily puts 
                         down his pen.) Look, if you cant be 
                         honest with me...
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (His tone quick, almost blurting) I 
                         was visiting someone. It wasnt a patient. 
                         Alright? (He sighs, shakes his head. 
                         Hes fucked, either way.) What am I 
                         gonna do?
 
                                     LAWYER
                         Well, as your lawyer and your friend, 
                         my advice to you is to bite the bullet 
                         and give them your alibi now. Because 
                         no one is going to believe you later.
 
                         
               Cut back to the Bathroom. Lawrence, still sitting against the 
               wall, throws down his hacksaw next to him, resting his hand against 
               his knee.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (sighs) That was five months ago. He 
                         tried to set me up for murder.
 
               Cut back to the Interrogation room, some time Later. Lawrence 
               is sitting alone at the table. Sing comes through the door, shuts 
               it behind him.
 
                                     SING
                         Okay. We checked your alibi. It holds 
                         up. (His voice indicates that he still 
                         believes theres more to it; he does 
                         not and will not trust Lawrence.)
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Good! Can I go home now?

                                     SING
                         (continuing) We have one of the victims 
                         who managed to escape. (As he speaks, 
                         we see a young woman with brown hair 
                         in a ponytail wearing a visitors pass 
                         being led carefully into the room next 
                         to them and sat at a table. This is 
                         AMANDA. Lawrence and Sing can see her 
                         clearly; she cannot see them.) Want 
                         to know if you wouldnt mind sticking 
                         around and listening to her testimony? 
                         Maybe itll trigger something. (Tapp 
                         and an unidentified bald black man in 
                         a suit enter the room. The man guides 
                         Amanda into her chair, stands behind 
                         her against the wall. Tapp sits in a 
                         chair to her left.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (doesnt really care) Id like to help, 
                         really, but...
 
                                     SING
                         (cutting him off quickly, wont let 
                         him out of this that easily) Well, wed 
                         really appreciate it. Shes the only 
                         one who made it.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (quietly, giving in.) Okay.

               Camera moves into the Interrogation room with Amanda, Tapp, and 
               the unidentified man. As Tapp speaks, the camera slowly moves 
               closer over his shoulder and towards Amanda. As we get closer 
               to her, we see long, strange, scar-like markings along each side 
               of her mouth. She is shaken, her eyes distant, never looking 
               anyone, including Tapp, in the eye. It is clear that her mind 
               is still lost somewhere within her nightmare.
 
                                     TAPP
                         (speaking slowly, gently) Amanda...in 
                         your own time, tell me the first thing 
                         you remember.
 
               We move closer and closer to Amanda, then suddenly the camera 
               spins round quickly and snaps into an alternate view of her, 
               her flashback. The room she is in has the same lime-green lighting 
               as Pauls cell. Amanda sits in a chair wearing a strange iron 
               contraption around her head, a bear-trap like device covering 
               her mouth. We can see her eyes, surrounded with black eyeliner, 
               as they slowly open, groggy, just waking up.
 
                                     AMANDA
                         (VO) I woke up. All I could taste was 
                         blood. (The camera moves back quickly, 
                         and we see her tied to the chair, her 
                         wrists bound to the arms of the chair. 
                         She pulls against her bonds, moaning 
                         loudly, trying to speak or cry out but 
                         cannot.) And metal.
 
               She continues to struggle against her bonds some more. The camera 
               circles around her, and we get a better view of the strange device 
               on her head, and the padlock and timer on the back of it. A long 
               wire hangs down from the timer and below the screen.
 
               The view switches to the side of her and we see next to her an 
               old television set, which suddenly switches on, startling her. 
               After a brief moment of static, the frightening image of a demented 
               clown-like doll its face white with red spirals on its cheeks, 
               its red eyes leering at Amanda from the screen. She stares at 
               it, her moans a bit softer to match her fear and utter confusion. 
               The doll speaks, the jaw moving; it is the voice of Jigsaw.
 
               
                                     JIGSAW
                         (from the TV) Hello Amanda. You dont 
                         know me, but I know you. I want to play 
                         a game. Heres what happens if you lose. 
                         (The video moves next to the doll, to 
                         a device like the one shes wearing 
                         attached to a mannequin head. As he 
                         continues, explaining what it is, her 
                         breathing grows faster and heavier, 
                         and her moans pick up more.) The device 
                         youre wearing is hooked into your upper 
                         and lower jaws. When the timer at the 
                         back goes off, your mouth will be permanently 
                         ripped open. Think of it like a reverse 
                         bear trap. Here, Ill show you.
 
               The video pans back to a view of the doll and the device. The 
               dolls head moves and looks down at the device, and the camera 
               zooms in on it. A timer ticks away. A few seconds later, SNAP! 
               The device springs and the fake head is crushed and explodes. 
               Amanda shrieks, her eyes widening. The video switches back to 
               a close up of the doll.
 
                                     JIGSAW
                         (from the TV) There is only one key 
                         to open the device. Its in the stomach 
                         of your dead cellmate. Look around, 
                         Amanda. Know that Im not lying. You 
                         better hurry up. Live or die. Make your 
                         choice.
 
               The video goes to white and gray static, then switches off. Amanda 
               begins to struggle like a madwoman against her bonds and the 
               chair. The camera swings around her, circling, making her movements 
               fast and jerky. Amanda manages to pull one arm free, then the 
               other and stands up quickly. Thats when the cord in the back 
               of the device is pulled out, and the timer starts. She freezes, 
               her eyes widening. We see a close-up of the timer, and it begins 
               its sixty second countdown. She reaches behind her head, pulling 
               at the lock and the timer, trying to pull it off, but it is stuck 
               there. She starts freaking out, pulling at it as much as she 
               can, the camera movements once again fast and jerky around her.
 
               
               The camera spins back to Amanda sitting still in her chair in 
               the interrogation room, sniffling. We see a brief shot of Lawrence, 
               who watches and listens to her with grim amazement. Back to Amanda.
 
               
                                     AMANDA
                         And then I saw the body.

               We switch back into Amandas cell. Over her shoulder, we see 
               near the corner the body of a man lying on the floor on his back. 
               Amanda cautiously approaches it, the timer still ticking away, 
               her hands still at the device. She kneels down cautiously next 
               to him. She reaches down and with a shaking hand lifts up his 
               shirt, revealing a large, black question mark drawn on his abdomen. 
               She sobs harder, hunched over him.
 
               Quick cut to the interrogation room, Amanda in the center of 
               the shot.
 
                                     AMANDA
                         There was a knife.

               Back to the cell. Amanda, still leaning over, picks up a small 
               knife next to the body. She slowly brings it up in both of her 
               shaking hands, clutching it. She looks closer at it. A quick 
               shot of the timer shows it to be at 25 seconds now, almost halfway. 
               The camera moves to a shot of the mans face, when...
 
               HE OPENS HIS EYES AND STARTS TO WAKE UP. He moans, unable to 
               speak or move. His eyes slowly, groggily look around a bit. He 
               cannot even open his mouth; someone has very heavily drugged 
               him. He sees Amanda over him with a knife and his eyes widen; 
               he tries to moan at her to stop, to not do what shes about to 
               do, but she turns the knife upside down in both hands and quickly 
               stabs down. He moans in agony in the background as she stabs 
               down again, and again, and again. Blood splashes on her hands.
 
               
               A quick shot back of Lawrence as he listens, his mouth open slightly, 
               eyes wide, staring at her. Cut back to Amanda in the cell as 
               she stabs down a few more times. Then back again to the table 
               in Lawrences interrogation room. Sing throws down an evidence 
               baggie with a used syringe in it.
 
                                     SING
                         (VO as camera pans up to Lawrence) Hed 
                         been injected with an opiate overdose. 
                         He couldnt move or feel much of anything.
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         You mean....he was alive?

                                     SING
                         (staring, nods slightly) Was.

               Back to Amandas Interrogation room, her head still hung, still 
               sniffling. A view of Tapp as he asks
 
                                     TAPP
                         What happened after you took it off?
 
                         
               Cut back to the cell, her bloody hands sifting through intestines 
               for a key. Cut back to interrogation room Amanda, then cut back 
               again to her holding up a liver or some other organ. Back to 
               interrogation room Amanda, the horror on her face growing, then 
               back to the cell.
 
               Amanda s hand pulls a small key from inside the organ shes 
               holding. She reaches around the back of her head, quickly trying 
               to unlock the padlock. The timer ticks away, faster and faster. 
               She gets it, pulls off the padlock and opens the device in the 
               back, ripping it away from her head and throwing it down as it 
               snaps open. She lets out the most terrible, agonized, heart-wrenching 
               scream, sobbing loudly, her hands held out in front of her, rocking 
               back and forth.
 
               Suddenly from another corner of the room, a light comes on, revealing 
               the puppet from the video in the corner. Amanda sees it, staring 
               at it wide eyed, her sobs softening for a moment as she stares 
               at it. Slowly, it wheels towards her on a tricycle. She can only 
               stare and cry, not sure what to do or expect. It stops, leering 
               at her, then speaks.
 
                                     JIGSAW
                         Congratulations. You are still alive. 
                         Most people are so ungrateful to be 
                         alive. But not you. Not anymore.
 
               Cut back into a close up of Amanda in the interrogation room, 
               her head still shaking a bit, almost like a series of slight 
               spasms. She continues to sniffle, her eyes far off. Cut to Tapp.
 
               
                                     TAPP
                         You are, in fact, a drug addict. Isnt 
                         that right, Mandy? (she nods, but doesnt 
                         look up.) Do you think that is why he 
                         picked you? (She lets out a sob, briefly 
                         nodding once.) Are you grateful, Mandy?
 
                         
               She finally raises her head, looking into his eyes for the first 
               time.
 
                                     AMANDA
                         (softly) He...helped me.

               As she starts sniffling and breathing more heavily, Tapp looks 
               over his shoulder into Lawrences room, right in his direction. 
               He may not see him, but he knows hes there. The camera then 
               cuts back to Amanda, who starts sobbing more heavily again. Slowly, 
               the camera moves down into and under the table, fading back into 
               an overhead view of the bathroom where Lawrence and Adam are.
 
               
               Adam sits in his corner, staring down at the floor as he has 
               been listening to Lawrences story. He looks up across to Lawrence.
 
               
                                     ADAM
                         (softly) Are you sure its him?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (nods slightly) Yeah, Im sure.

                                     ADAM
                         (becoming a little hysterical again. 
                         He speaks accusingly) How do I know 
                         youre telling the truth? You can be 
                         the one who put me in this room! (he 
                         gesticulates as he speaks, pointing 
                         to Lawrence and himself.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (internal eye roll, speaks slowly, as 
                         to a simpleton) Im in exactly the same 
                         situation youre in.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Wrong. (he stands up, kicking his chained 
                         foot out. Shouts.) Wrong! Youve got 
                         one thing I dont: Information! (He 
                         hovers as close as he can in a threatening 
                         pose, pointing) You know who did this! 
                         (He picks up a glass shard that fell 
                         when he broke the mirror, holds it up 
                         threateningly to Lawrence) Now you either 
                         tell me what is really going on (Lawrence 
                         rolls his eyes, turns his head over 
                         to his left, away from Adam) or Ill 
                         cut you with this, you hear me? Ill 
                         cut- (But he stops short as he sees 
                         something in the glass. He flips it 
                         over, studying it, flips it back. He 
                         looks over to the mirror on the wall, 
                         studying it, thinking.)
 
               Lawrence notices that Adams ranting has ended, glances over 
               at him.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         What?

                                     ADAM
                         (looks over at Lawrence, then back at 
                         the mirror.) Its a two-way mirror.
 
                         
               Adam drops the shard down on the floor carefully, then reaches 
               over to the corner behind him, leaning down and picking up a 
               loose padlock. He lifts it up and throws it as hard as he can 
               against the mirror, shattering most of the glass. Lawrence briefly 
               startles at the sound and force of the glass shattering. Adam 
               reaches back down, finds another piece of debris and throws that 
               at the mirror with just as much force. The rest of the glass 
               breaks away, and a camera with a red light can bee seen behind 
               a clear glass. Lawrence stands up to get a better look at it. 
               We movie in closer to the camera, getting a better look at it 
               as well.
 
               Suddenly there is a flash of static and we find ourselves looking 
               at a fuzzy, black and white surveillance video of Lawrence and 
               Adam in the bathroom, staring right at us into the camera. The 
               shot pulls back a bit and we see that the video is on a silver 
               surveillance monitor. A partial view of other recording-type 
               equipment can be seen on either side of the monitor. A mans 
               voice speaks, though it doesnt sound quite the same as on the 
               Jigsaw tapes. As he speaks, a hand wearing a black leather glove 
               raises up slightly and waves its fingers at the screen.
 
                                     MAN
                         (OS, Taunting) I can see you...

                                     ADAM
                         (from on video) So thats what this 
                         is. Reality TV.
 
                                     MAN
                         (OS. Still taunting, sounds as though 
                         on a power trip) Dont look at me. I 
                         cant help you.
 
               The shot transitions from the video view of Adam back into regular 
               view in the bathroom. Adam stands in a threatening pose to the 
               camera, speaks angrily, loudly to it, his voice dripping with 
               sarcasm.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Can you hear me in there? Huh? Im having 
                         a blast. (he bends down and picks up 
                         another piece of debris from the floor) 
                         This is the most fun Ive had without 
                         lubricant. (Hums the piece of debris 
                         at the window. It makes a thwacking 
                         sound, but doesnt break. Not even a 
                         crack.) Make sure youre getting everything. 
                         (Bends down, throws picks up and throws 
                         another piece of debris. It hits, but 
                         no breakage. Leans down for another 
                         piece.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (Scoffing tone as he watches Adam trying 
                         to break the glass) Thats not going 
                         to do anything.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (pauses, looks to Lawrence) You just 
                         want to leave it running on us? (the 
                         shot switches to surveillance view)
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (very matter-of-fact) Well, you wont 
                         stop it. (shot switches to regular view) 
                         Thats why we cant cut through these 
                         chains. Its why you wont break that 
                         glass. (he gestures to the pipe then 
                         the glass) Every possible angle has 
                         been pre-thought out by him. (He appears 
                         deep in thought, starting to understand 
                         the set-up more so, figuring out the 
                         way this guy thinks. Almost admiring 
                         him. The situation may be bad, but its 
                         a brilliant design.)
 
                                     ADAM
                         You sound like you admire this prick.
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (explaining) To overcome something, 
                         you have to understand what a perfect 
                         engine it is. Thats how you fight disease. 
                         (He looks up at the ceiling, at the 
                         walls, around the room) Now the tape 
                         told us to find an X. That X has to 
                         be somewhere in this room. (determined) 
                         Help me find it.
 
               Adam does not help him look. He simply cannot believe Lawrences 
               calm demeanor in this situation anymore. It seems that he is 
               almost becoming as sick of Lawrences attitude as Lawrence is 
               of his. He speaks a with a bit of a hyper tone again, accusingly.
 
               
                                     ADAM
                         How can you be the calm Doctor Guy when 
                         your wife and kid are out there. (Shot 
                         of Lawrence looking around the room) 
                         Hes got them, too. (Shot of the clock; 
                         its now 12:05.) He could be doing anything 
                         to them right now. Are you thinking 
                         about that?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (Suddenly looks right at him, snaps 
                         angrily) I AM thinking about that. (Adam 
                         backs off a bit. Lawrence pauses a moment, 
                         his voice changes to calm but sad.) 
                         Ive been the last thing I said to my 
                         daughter.
 
               Lawrence turns away from Adam, placing his hand on the pipe behind 
               him, and the shot moves up into blackness, then up at the foot 
               of a little girls bed in a darkened bedroom. The little girl 
               is Diana. Shes about 5 or 6 years old, with long, wavy light 
               brown hair. She lays tucked in with her eyes closed, her favourite 
               teddy bear wrapped in her left arm. The camera moves up and over 
               her a bit, moving in closer to her. Chimes can be heard tinkling 
               very faintly against a soft breeze. As the shot pauses just above 
               her, her eyes suddenly open, blinking away sleepiness. She sits 
               up, pulling away the covers, still holding her teddy bear. She 
               remains sitting in her bed, staring over into the dark corner 
               to her right. The chimes jingle away. We move in closer to her 
               face; something has her spooked. A clock ticking is suddenly 
               heard as the image fades from Diana getting out of bed into a 
               strange, mechanical-looking clock on the living room wall of 
               the Gordon Household.
 
               The shot lowers and we see the nicely furnished living room of 
               the Gordon home. The walls are a dark, crimson red, the furniture 
               in tones of red and brown. It definitely is the living room of 
               a well-off family. Not too cold, but not as warm and homey as 
               it could be. Diana slowly makes her way across the living room 
               towards her parents bedroom, moving almost dream-like, her teddy 
               bear hanging limply from her right hand. She moves to the frosted 
               glass double doors of her parents room, opening them both into 
               the bedroom, where we see her mother, Alison, laying on her side, 
               fast asleep. Alison is in her early to mid thirties with long 
               blond hair going just past her shoulders and very pretty despite 
               her sleepiness and messy hair in this scene. Diana moves into 
               the room, standing next to the bed, saying nothing, just watching 
               her mother sleeping. Alisons eyes slowly open; the feeling of 
               being watched plus the instincts of a mother have awoken her. 
               She reaches over and turns on the light, looking upon her daughter 
               with concern.
 
                                     ALISON
                         Diana, Honey, are you okay? (she pushes 
                         back the covers and gets up, crouching 
                         down in front of her daughter. Looking 
                         up at her, she places her hands on her 
                         daughters arms.) Diana, Honey, can 
                         you hear me?
 
                                     DIANA
                         (very softly, but showing almost no 
                         fear) Mommy?
 
               Alison reaches up and touches Dianas hair, bringing her hand 
               down in a soft caress on Dianas cheek.
 
                                     ALISON
                         Oh, what is it, sweet pea?

                                     DIANA
                         (very calmly) Theres a man in my room.
 
                         
                                     ALISON
                         (sighing, but not rudely. This is not 
                         the first time this has happened) Oh 
                         Honey, are you sure hes not just hiding 
                         in your imagination?
 
                                     DIANA
                         He talked to me.

                                     ALISON
                         (sighs) Okay, Ill come and check your 
                         room. (She smiles a small, assuring 
                         smile)
 
                                     DIANA
                         I want Daddy. Hell get the scary man.
 
                         
                                     ALISON
                         (her smile fading a bit) Alright, if 
                         you want. Come on.
 
               She stands and leads Diana out of the room. Cut to Lawrences 
               office. Lawrence sits hunched slightly over his laptop computer, 
               focused on some paper hes writing. Diana and Alison appear in 
               the doorway to his left. He doesnt even look up, just keeps 
               typing. Alisons tone when she speaks indicates that she knows 
               hell probably say no, or put it off on her.
 
                                     ALISON
                         Larry, sorry to bother you, but your 
                         daughter had a bad dream again.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (his eyes never leaving the screen; 
                         raises his finger to pause them) Just 
                         a minute.
 
                                     ALISON
                         She wants you to check her room.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (keeps typing, never looks up) Mmm hmm, 
                         mmm hmm, just gotta finish this paragraph.
 
                         
               Alison waits a moment, then turns to Diana.

                                     ALISON
                         (softly) You know what sweetie? Ill 
                         go check with you.
 
               They turn, slowly start to walk away as Lawrence quickly finishes 
               typing, then closes the laptop.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Nope! Im done. (he smiles, turning 
                         to look at them.)
 
               Cut to Dianas room. Lawrence reaches over and turns on the lamp 
               on Dianas side table. Diana lies in bed, slightly propped up 
               against her pillows and stuffed animals. Lawrence sits on the 
               side of her bed.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (very reassuringly) See? (he pulls the 
                         covers up over her, up to her chest.) 
                         Theres no one in your room. Theres 
                         no such thing as the bad man. Now can 
                         you go to sleep?
 
                                     DIANA
                         Im still scared.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         You are? Give me your tootsie. (He pulls 
                         back the covers and she pulls out her 
                         foot. He takes it in his hand.) Oh, 
                         what a big tootsie. (He turns to her, 
                         raising his eyebrows up) Remember this 
                         one? (He counts on her toes as he says 
                         the following) This little piggy went 
                         to market, this little piggy stayed 
                         home, this little piggy had roast beef, 
                         this little piggy had none, and this 
                         little piggy went Weeee! (he tickles 
                         up her leg to her tummy and she giggles) 
                         all the way home!
 
               Just then, Lawrences beeper goes off. He leans back, takes it 
               out and looks at it.
 
                                     DIANA
                         I hate that thing.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Well I have to go to work, sweetheart. 
                         You know what Daddys job is like. Now, 
                         come on. (he re-tucks her in, she smiles 
                         at him.) Lets see. Try and get some 
                         sleep now, okay? (He gives her a kiss, 
                         smiles, stands up and goes to the door.)
 
                         
                                     DIANA
                         Youre not going to leave us, are you, 
                         Daddy?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (suddenly concerned) What? (He stops 
                         at the door, turns, goes back over to 
                         her bed, sits down next to her and leans 
                         over. This was the last thing hed expected 
                         her to say) What are you talking about? 
                         You mean, leave you and Mommy? (She 
                         nods; he reaches up and gently brushes 
                         her hair away from her face.) No, no 
                         sweetheart, I would never do that. Who 
                         gave you that idea?
 
                                     DIANA
                         No one.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Well its not true, okay?

                                     DIANA
                         (very softly) Okay.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         How much do I love you?

               He moves his face closer to her and together they say

                                     LAWRENCE & DIANA
                         Love you very much

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Thats right, thats right! (He gives 
                         her a kiss, pulls back.) Good night, 
                         sweetie.
 
                                     DIANA
                         Good night, Daddy.

               Lawrence gets up and goes to the door, flipping the lights off. 
               He pauses before he steps out.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Tomorrow, Ill read you your favourite 
                         story.
 
                                     DIANA
                         (with a small smile) Okay.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Okay. (he goes out.)

               Quick cut to the Entrance Hall of the Gordon Residence. Lawrence 
               walks towards the door, Alison behind him. Alisons voice starts 
               to cut over the scene. Her tone is very pissed off.
 
                                     ALISON
                         I dont know how much longer I can do 
                         this, Larry.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (sounds as though he has no idea what 
                         she means) What, what are you talking 
                         about?
 
                                     ALISON
                         (pissed, in disbelief) How can you walk 
                         through life pretending that youre 
                         happy?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         I am happy.

                                     ALISON
                         (confrontational) That is complete bullshit. 
                         (cut to a shot of Diana, laying on her 
                         side in her darkened room, clutching 
                         her teddy bear to her chest. Her eyes 
                         are open, she can hear everything. We 
                         stay with her for the rest of Alisons 
                         line, her voice now off a bit in the 
                         distance but still very audible) Id 
                         rather you break down and tell me that 
                         you hated me. At least thered be some 
                         passion in it.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Would you like to see her? (He reaches 
                         into his pocket and takes out his wallet, 
                         throws it across the room to Adam, who 
                         is sitting with his back against the 
                         wall, facing Lawrence. Adam picks up 
                         the wallet and opens it. He sees two 
                         pictures of Diana, side by side. The 
                         one on the left is Diana hugging a dog. 
                         The one on the right is a smiling portrait 
                         outside somewhere.

                         Shes beautiful.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Thank you.

                                     ADAM
                         (sighs, then looks up at Lawrence) You 
                         gonna have any more kids?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (a bit wearily, but not snobby) Weve 
                         talked about it, but uh, with our schedules, 
                         its difficult enough to concentrate 
                         on one. (The tone of his voice indicates 
                         that maybe hes starting to realize 
                         that he shouldve spent more time and 
                         attention to his daughter.)
 
                                     ADAM
                         (referring to the wallet) So wheres 
                         the lucky wife? (a small smile)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Theres another picture behind the one 
                         youre looking at. (Adam reaches behind 
                         the photo on the right and pulls another 
                         photograph out. Lawrence smiles slightly 
                         as he speaks) Its my favourite one 
                         because were all in it together. Someone, 
                         usually me, has to hold the camera, 
                         which means Im always missing from 
                         the photos.
 
               Cut to Adam, looking at the picture he pulled out. His face is 
               blank, but you can sense great disturbance behind it. Cut to 
               a shot of the photo he is holding. It is not the one Lawrence 
               described, but a Polaroid of Alison and Diana bound and gagged, 
               and the message Regards with a jigsaw piece drawn next to it. 
               He turns the photo over, and there is a message. As he reads 
               it, Jigsaw reads it aloud in a voiceover.
 
                                     JIGSAW
                         (VO) X Marks the spot. Sometimes you 
                         see more with your eyes shut.
 
               Adam does his best to hide what he has seen, looks up to Lawrence.
 
               
                                     ADAM
                         Its uh, its not here.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (a slight disturbance from his momentary 
                         nostalgic bliss) What?
 
                                     ADAM
                         Uh, this photo youre talking about...its 
                         not here.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (slightly surprised, reaching out his 
                         hand for Adam to toss the wallet.) Really? 
                         Are you sure?
 
                                     ADAM
                         Yeah. (Tucking the picture in his right 
                         hand, he shifts slightly by lifting 
                         himself a bit with his right hand, sneakily 
                         putting the photograph down and tossing 
                         the wallet with his left hand. Lawrence 
                         picks up the wallet and starts looking 
                         for it, creasing his brow in concern, 
                         while Adam backs up against his wall, 
                         holding the photograph out of Lawrences 
                         sight against a pipe he rests his arm 
                         on as he looks at the photograph.)
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (disbelief, shaking his head) He...he 
                         mustve taken it. I...
 
               Alisons voice over is heard as he says this and continues to 
               look through the wallet, and we hear Alisons voiceover from 
               the scene in the main hall.
 
                                     ALISON
                         (VO) How can you walk through life pretending 
                         that youre happy?
 
               CUT TO the Main Hall of the Gordon Residence, back to the earlier 
               flashback of Lawrence and Alison. This time, we stay with them.
 
               
                                     LAWRENCE
                         I am happy. (He walks over to a chair, 
                         leaning over it as he puts something 
                         down, gets his briefcase ready to go 
                         to work. Alison stands a few feet behind 
                         him, trying her best to get him to react, 
                         to stop the bullshit and end the masquerade.)
 
                         
                                     ALISON
                         (pissed) That is complete bullshit. 
                         Id rather you break down and tell me 
                         that you hated me. At least thered 
                         be some passion in it.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (tired of this, brushing it off as not 
                         that important, like there really is 
                         nothing wrong) We can talk about this 
                         alter, okay? (He leans in to kiss her, 
                         but she shakes her head. He pauses there.)
 
                         
                                     ALISON
                         (firmly) Just leave.

               He looks at her for a moment, searching, then slowly turns away 
               and heads out the door.
 
                                     VOICE
                         Goodnight, little girl. (camera pans 
                         up closer into the closet, and we a 
                         widened blue eye and part of a face 
                         (yet unidentifiable) watching her.)
 
                         
               The closet doors burst open and Diana screams. Cut back to the 
               main hall where Alison stands alone, her head lowered slightly. 
               As soon as she hears the scream she turns and bolts towards her 
               daughters room.
 
                                     ALISON
                         Diana!?

               Alison gets to just outside the door to her bedroom.

                                     ALISON
                         Diana! (opens the door and flips on 
                         the light, gasps when she sees a figure 
                         covered by a blanket looming over Dianas 
                         bed. The figure suddenly grabs Diana 
                         and she screams, struggling against 
                         him. Alison goes for them.
 
               Quick cut to NOW, in Alison and Lawrences bedroom. Waistline 
               shot of a figure wearing a black coat, black leather gloves and 
               blue jeans, holding a stethoscope. A gun is tucked into his belt 
               and Dianas teddy bear tucked under his arm. He saunters over 
               to the gagged and bound Diana and Alison, on the floor and tied 
               to a corner end of the bed. Alison, her eyes streaming tears, 
               struggles and pulls against her bonds to try to get at him but 
               fails. Diana keeps crying Mommy! over and over again and sobbing.
 
               
               The figure crouches down beside Diana, dropping the teddy bear 
               behind her, his face still unseen. He takes the stethoscope and 
               holds the end to Dianas chest. The sound of a loud, steady heartbeat 
               is heard. Alison screams at him through her gag.
 
                                     ALISON
                         Dont do that! Leave her! Get away from 
                         her!
 
               He pulls away the stethoscope and the heartbeat halts. He reaches 
               with his right hand and pulls from his belt the gun. Dianas 
               screams become more desperate, Alisons more frantic, more angry. 
               He puts the stethoscope back against Dianas chest and moves 
               the gun up and down in front of her, then bringing it up to her 
               mothers head. We hear the heartbeat again, doubled in speed.
 
               
                                     ALISON
                         (through her gag) Keep your motherfucking 
                         hands off of my daughter!
 
               He pulls away the gun and the stethoscope, tucking the gun back 
               into his belt. He reaches down behind Diana and picks up the 
               teddy bear. As he does, we catch a brief glimpse of the lower 
               half of his face, but not enough for a clear identification yet. 
               He holds the teddy bear out in front of Diana for a moment then 
               tucks it in front of her. He pats her on the head and stands 
               up, moving over to the window. He parts the curtains slightly 
               and leans forward a bit, and we see his face more clearly. It 
               is Zep, the orderly from the hospital.
 
               Cut to static, and then a surveillance video view of the exterior 
               of the Gordon home, of the window where Zep is standing. The 
               camera zooms in on him and we hear a raspy, male voice speaking.
 
               
                                     VOICE
                         (VO as we view shot of Zep) Who are 
                         you little man...I see you...(cut to 
                         a television screen with the video of 
                         Zep in the window. Fade back and to 
                         the right as we get a view of someones 
                         apartment. Plastered on the walls are 
                         various photographs, which we can barely 
                         make out, and a desk in the corner with 
                         some recording equipment. As we move 
                         further right and hit the window we 
                         see Detective Tapp, leaning over the 
                         camera shooting the Gordons window, 
                         adjusting the view. Something about 
                         him seems just not right. We cut back 
                         to his view from the camera.) Does Dr. 
                         Gordon know youre at home with his 
                         wife? I know you know something. (his 
                         voice goes up a bit louder) What are 
                         you doing in there? Waiting for the 
                         doctor? Im waiting for the doctor, 
                         too. Hmm.
 
               Cut to a view over Tapps couch of the television with Zep on 
               video on the screen. Tapp walks over and sits down in front of 
               the television, his back to us.
 
                                     TAPP
                         I never should have let you go...

               Camera pans up to a wall of articles, all about the Jigsaw killings. 
               It moves quickly and zooms in on each headline we see. Jigsaw 
               hunt brings D.A. before Judge, Missing Man discovered at Bizarre 
               Crime Scene screaming is heard then a quick flashback shot of 
               Paul in his cage, first struggling against the wire then hanging 
               dead in his cage Killer Preaching Says Top Cop, Psychopath 
               Teaches Sick Life Lessons, quick shot of Mark going around looking 
               for the code on the walls, with the sound of his screaming over 
               the shot, Escape, Victim Survives Maniacs Game quick flashback 
               footage of Amanda in the interrogation room, then fighting with 
               her mask, and a shot of Lawrence watching and listening to her 
               testimony, Doctor Questioned in Case flash of shots of Lawrence 
               being questioned by the Tapp and Sing and then his Lawyer. It 
               ends on the flashback shot of Tapp looking back at Lawrence through 
               the two-way glass after Amanda tells her story, and the shot 
               slides into a shot of a car pulling up alongside a building.
 
               
                                     TAPP
                         (VO, fading, hushed against soundtrack) 
                         I never shouldve let you go...
 
               The car pulls up alongside a building, with Lawrence in the passenger 
               seat, and Tapp driving. Lawrences awkwardness, Tapps distrust, 
               and general uncomfortable tension can be easily detected between 
               them.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (Pretending like hes trying to be helpful, 
                         really just glad to be out of Tapps 
                         company) Here we are. That was uh, quite 
                         an amazing story that poor woman told. 
                         (Tapp just nods, says nothing. Lawrence 
                         smiles very uncomfortably, gets out 
                         of the car.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (leaning down and looking back into 
                         the car window.) Look, Im sorry I cant 
                         be of more help to your investigation.
 
                         
                                     TAPP
                         (nods very slightly) You know, we arrested 
                         a dentist last week who like to play 
                         with kids a bit too much. He lived two 
                         blocks from here. The sewer lines run 
                         under this neighborhood too, Doctor. 
                         (hint hint)
 
               Lawrence stands straight up, walks away. Tapp waits a moment, 
               then drives off.
 
               BAM into static and then the video from Amandas cell. We are 
               not at Tapps desk in the police station, watching him obsessively 
               watch the video, staring at the screen, remote control in hand. 
               As he watches, the camera circles around behind the television 
               to give us a better view of our obsessed detective.
 
                                     JIGSAW
                         (from the video) Hello Amanda. You dont 
                         know me, but I know you. I want to play 
                         a game. Heres what happens if you lose. 
                         Theres a timer at the back of the device 
                         youre wearing. When the timer goes 
                         off, your mouth will be permanently 
                         ripped open.
 
               In the background of the station we hear a couple of detectives 
               talking, then Sing walks in behind Tapp, over to his own desk. 
               He turns, watching Tapp watch the screen. Tapp stops and rewinds 
               the tape.
 
                                     SING
                         (to the other detectives leaving) Ill 
                         catch you guys down there. (he reaches 
                         over and gets something off of his desk)
 
                         
                                     JIGSAW
                         (from video) Think of it like a reverse 
                         bear trap.
 
               Tapp fast forwards a bit, hits play.

                                     JIGSAW
                         (from video) Ill show you...

               Tapp watches closely the demonstration of the timer then the 
               device going off and exploding. Sing watches too, not paying 
               as close attention. As soon as it explodes, Sing speaks. The 
               look on his face and the tone of his voice indicates his growing 
               concern for his partners obsession over this case.
 
                                     SING
                         Hey Tapp?

               Tapp doesnt look up, resembles Lawrence in the earlier scene 
               when Alison and Diana came to him to check her room while he 
               was working on his paper.
 
                                     TAPP
                         Mmm?

                                     SING
                         Were gonna go down to the Grill, go 
                         get a beer. You wanna come?
 
                                     TAPP
                         I dont think so. Thanks anyway.

                                     SING
                         (Figured he might answer as such) You 
                         know I always ask. (He puts on his jacket)
 
                         
                                     JIGSAW
                         (on video) There is only one key...
 
                         
                                     SING
                         Ill leave you to have fun up here. 
                         (He puts his hands on his hips, watching 
                         some more of the video.)
 
                                     JIGSAW
                         (on video) Its in the stomach of your 
                         dead cellmate.
 
                                     SING
                         (still trying to reach him, break him 
                         from his obsession groove) Hey Tapp? 
                         I dont mean for this to be disrespectful...(pause) 
                         Maybe you should find yourself a girlfriend.
 
                         
               Sing chuckles, hits Tapp playfully on the arm, tapp laughs a 
               bit too, but doesnt look up. Sing remains grinning a bit. But 
               then Tapp continues and rewinds the video a bit.
 
                                     JIGSAW
                         (on video) Its in the stomach of your 
                         dead cellmate.
 
               Tapp fast forwards.

                                     JIGSAW
                         (on video) Look around, Amanda. Know 
                         that Im not lying. (Sing steps off 
                         to the right) You better hurry up. (Tapp 
                         rewinds again, suddenly pauses)
 
                                     TAPP
                         Wait wait wait, Sing!

               Sing stops, turns.

                                     TAPP
                         Get back here!

                                     SING
                         What?

                                     TAPP
                         Mmm! (he gestures franticly for him 
                         to come over.)
 
                                     SING
                         (sighs then comes over) What?

               Tapp rewinds one second then pauses, holds pencil to the screen 
               to a grafittied wall on the video.
 
                                     TAPP
                         Remember 118th Street?

                                     SING
                         (looks at the screen, thinks a minute) 
                         Ah...K2K. That gangs territory was 
                         only about four blocks.
 
                                     TAPP
                         Now listen to this.

               They listen with the volume up high. Over the static, the sound 
               of a fire alarm can just barely be heard in the background. They 
               look at each other. Tapp hits stop.
 
                                     TAPP
                         (looking up at Sing) We gotta check 
                         the records from all the fire emergencies 
                         that occurred there in the last two 
                         weeks. Go, right now! Mmm!
 
               Sing turns and quickly walks off.

                                     CUT TO
                         Close up of a map, with Sing speaking 
                         in a voiceover. As he speaks, theres 
                         a brief shot of the two of them sitting 
                         over the map, then quick shots of a 
                         few black and white photographs of a 
                         warehouse, including a close up of a 
                         street sign Stygian St.
 
                                     SING
                         (VO) On the night of Tuesday, the 17th, 
                         we got a fire alarm going off in the 
                         rear wing of 213 Stygian Street. Its 
                         an old listing. Used to be a mannequin 
                         factory. (cut back to view of the two 
                         detectives) You think we have enough 
                         for a warrant, though?
 
                                     TAPP
                         Who said anything about a warrant? (He 
                         grins, gets up and grabs his jacket.)
 
                         
                                     SING
                         (are you serious?) Right now?

                                     TAPP
                         Why not?

                                     SING
                         Yeah, why not? (He grabs his gun, snaps 
                         a cartridge into it, grabsup his coat, 
                         and quickly follows Tapp.
 
               Brief shot of K2K graffiti on the video and then loud static, 
               which snaps into an exterior nighttime view of an old warehouse 
               building and a car speeding by. Our view is from inside the car 
               as it pulls up alongside the building. A police radio can be 
               heard in the background. So can the sound of a gun being loaded 
               and cocked.
 
                                     TAPP
                         (VO) At least well have the cover of 
                         darkness.
 
                                     SING
                         (VO) Yeah, well, so will anybody else.
 
                         
               A shot of inside the factory, various clutter and tables piled 
               up on one another. No signs of life...yet. A bang from the outside 
               of the door is heard. A couple more bangs and a shot of the giant, 
               sliding wooden door as it slides open, and Sing steps in, holding 
               out his shotgun, ready for anything waiting for them. Cut up 
               to a staircase, lit by eerie green light, the same as from Pauls 
               razor wire room, as the detectives make their way up cautiously, 
               Tapp in front, Sing covering behind them. They come up another 
               level, one that has been recently used we see as Tapp points 
               over to a desk with a computer, a radio, and some other miscellaneous 
               items. Then, right next to the desk, we see the K2K graffiti 
               from the video.
 
                                     TAPP
                         I got you...

               They continue on, moving into a room separated with a chain link 
               fence. There is a slightly raised platform, going along part 
               of the wall, with a few steps leading up on either side. Tapp 
               goes up the steps. On the raised area are some tables covered 
               in heavy red cloth. Tapp points to one, reaches down, and pulls 
               back the covering. He reveals a small diorama of the bathroom 
               scene where Adam and Lawrence dolls, complete with the body, 
               dolls representing each of them.
 
                                     TAPP
                         What the hell is this?.......(his voice 
                         almost a whisper) Oh shit...
 
               They move onto the next table, and Tapp pulls back the cloth 
               covering that one, revealing the leering Puppet from Amandas 
               video. Tapp stares at it wide-eyed. Next to the puppet is a strange, 
               boar-like mask with long dark hair. The camera pans back so we 
               have the view of another large object covered in red cloth that 
               Tapp and Sing had passed by. Tapp leans in closer to look at 
               the puppet, when suddenly the still-covered form starts to move 
               and muffled moaning sounds are heard. It startles the detectives.
 
               
                                     SING
                         Oh fuck!

               They both go over and stand on either side of it, taking one 
               end of the red cloth whipping it off. Underneath is a man tied 
               to a chair with duct tape over his mouth, held in place by a 
               manacle around his neck. A contraption on the chair holds two 
               power drills about six inches from either side of his head, pointed 
               directly at his temples. His eyes wide, he moans through his 
               tape at the detectives.
 
               Suddenly, a door is heard clanging open on the other side of 
               the building, and the detectives spin to face the sound, guns 
               ready.
 
                                     TAPP
                         (looks to Sing, says softly) Wait Sing!
 
                         
                                     SING
                         (trying to keep his voice low but coming 
                         off a bit loudly) What?
 
                                     TAPP
                         (eager) Lets see what hes gonna do.
 
                         
                                     SING
                         Why? Weve fucking got him.

               Tapp however, having studied this guy for so long, wants to get 
               a good look at him before hes captured, see him in his element.
 
               
                                     TAPP
                         We dont know what he looks like. Lets 
                         see what hes gonna do.
 
                                     SING
                         (rather loudly, again) No fucking way!
 
                         
               As the two argue, the man in the chair continues to protest his 
               position.
 
                                     TAPP
                         Sing, Sing! (he moves in front of the 
                         man a bit, holding up his hand to try 
                         to halt Sing, trying to convince him 
                         to go along with him.)
 
                                     SING
                         (isnt buying into it) Fuck that. Im 
                         gonna take him.
 
                                     TAPP
                         Sing!

                                     SING
                         What the fuck? Shit!

                                     TAPP
                         Wait Sing, listen.

               Whoever it is is moving closer, so they quickly cover up the 
               man and the other things they uncovered. The man in the chair 
               protests loudly through his gag and struggles as much as he can 
               in his chair. Sing and Tapp go and hide behind a tarp covering 
               the entryway to another room while a figure in a black robe lined 
               in red comes up on the elevator. The elevator stops, and the 
               figure moves forward, slowly and carefully. He goes up the steps 
               to the man in the chair. The figures hood is up; we do not see 
               his face. As he walks, he seems like he might be having a somewhat 
               difficult time with it.
 
               He reaches and uncovers the man, who begs in muffled tones through 
               the gag. When the figure speaks, we instantly know it is Jigsaw; 
               it is the unmistakable voice from the tapes and the video.
 
               
                                     JIGSAW
                         Awake already, Jeff? I need more powerful 
                         tranquilizers next time. (Jeff continues 
                         his cries, sheds a few tears. Jigsaw 
                         reaches over and touches his shoulder) 
                         Dont cry. Ive given your life a purpose. 
                         Youre a test subject for something 
                         greater than yourself.
 
               Thats when Sing cocks the shotgun and the two detectives move 
               out of their hiding spot, aiming their weapons at Jigsaw.
 
                                     SING
                         Freeze! Police!

                                     TAPP
                         Hold it right there! Dont move!

                                     SING
                         Put your fucking hands in the air!
 
                         
               Jigsaw slowly raises his hands, starts to turn to face them but 
               then quickly steps down hard on a red button on the floor, and 
               the drill trap on Jeffs chair comes to life. He remains with 
               his back mostly to them, hands still raised.
 
                                     JIGSAW
                         Now youll make a choice. (Sing runs 
                         up the steps to try to where Jigsaw 
                         is, gun aimed at him. Tapp remains where 
                         he stands.) In 20 seconds, the life 
                         of this man will be ended.
 
                                     TAPP
                         Shut up and get down here!

                                     SING
                         (keeping his gun steadily aimed) What 
                         did you do? Turn it off!
 
               Jeff in the meantime is struggling in his seat as the drills 
               come closer.
 
                                     TAPP
                         Sing, stop that thing! Im taking this 
                         bastard down. (Sing tosses Tapp the 
                         shotgun.) Move!
 
                                     SING
                         (to Jigsaw) How do you turn it off?!
 
                         
                                     TAPP
                         Tell him how to stop it!

               Jigsaw backs up a bit towards the stairs.

                                     JIGSAW
                         One key will unlock it.

                         (frantic) Where is it?!

                                     JIGSAW
                         Its in the box.

                                     SING
                         Box! (He sees a box on the side of the 
                         chair and opens it. Inside he pulls 
                         out a ring of at least 30 keys, and 
                         goes over to behind Jeff to try to unlock 
                         the device. He tries a couple of keys, 
                         none working.) Fuck! Which key, which 
                         key?!
 
                                     TAPP
                         Tell him which key it is!

                                     JIGSAW
                         (now facing Tapp, moving closer to him. 
                         His back is to us, we still dont see 
                         his face.) Time is running out.
 
                                     TAPP
                         Shut up and get down here right now, 
                         asshole!
 
               Jigsaw slowly moves down towards him more.

                                     JIGSAW
                         Whats more important to you Officer, 
                         arresting me or the life of another 
                         human being?
 
               Sing keeps trying various keys. Tapp goes up Jigsaw and grabs 
               him, pushing him down to his knees. Jigsaw keeps his arms slightly 
               raised.
 
                                     TAPP
                         Get down on your knees!

                                     SING
                         Jesus! Tapp! Tapp!

                         Hands behind your head! (Jigsaw obliges) 
                         Sick bastard.
 
                                     JIGSAW
                         Yes, I am sick, Officer.

                                     SING
                         (still trying various keys, none working. 
                         Hes in a full-fledged panic. Jeff closes 
                         his eyes, crying, as the drills are 
                         only 2 inches away) Tapp! Its like, 
                         theres a hundred keys in here!
 
                                     JIGSAW
                         Sick from the disease eating away at 
                         me inside. Sick of people who dont 
                         appreciate their blessings. Sick of 
                         those who scoff at the suffering of 
                         others.
 
               Sing finally whips out his gun and shoots each drill, breaking 
               and stopping them. Tapp glances up at him, briefly distracted 
               by the gunfire.
 
                                     JIGSAW
                         (as he pops a blade out of a wristband 
                         hidden up his right sleeve) Sick of 
                         it all! (He lashes upwards, slashing 
                         Tapps throat)
 
                                     SING
                         (seeing the throat slash) Tapp!!! (runs 
                         down from Jeff towards them. Tapp clutches 
                         his throat, completely surprised, gurgling.)
 
                         
               Jigsaw RUNS, fast as he can, out of the room. Sing takes a couple 
               of shots at him and misses. He stops when he reaches Tapp, who 
               is slumped against the fence/wall and bends down next to him.
 
               
                                     SING
                         (desperate, a trace of despair) No, 
                         no! Tapp! Shit!
 
               Tapp gurgles at him, hands him the shotgun.

                                     SING
                         (standing, touching Tapp on the shoulder 
                         then head) Ill be back, okay? Ill 
                         be back.
 
               Tapp just kind of nods, gurgling and holding his throat. Sing 
               spins around and then starts chasing Jigsaw through the warehouse, 
               out of the room and down a flight of stairs. He moves down a 
               long, misty corridor, gun up, moving quickly but still cautiously. 
               He takes a right, goes down another flight of stairs then takes 
               another right, stopping and looking down a short flight of stairs. 
               Quick cut to Tapp starting to try to get up, holding his throat. 
               He drags himself along the floor.
 
               Back to Sing, who cocks his shotgun, then moves down the stairs 
               very cautiously. He takes a left around the corner, finds himself 
               facing down another corridor, where he sees Jigsaw trying to 
               get away. He takes aim.
 
                                     SING
                         (shouting) Freeze or Ill shoot!

               Jigsaw continues moving, so Sing fires. He hits, and Jigsaw goes 
               down. Sing pauses, waiting to see if he gets back up. Jigsaw 
               doesnt move, so Sing cocks the gun again and starts to slowly 
               move forward towards him. Cut to a shot of Tapp as he struggles 
               to his feet and starts towards the stairs to follow Sing.
 
               Back to Sing, moving further down the hall. He gets about halfway 
               down it when we see a shot of his feet just at a trip-wire. Over 
               it are some cobwebs hanging down. He reaches to part them, and 
               steps forward into the wire. As he steps we see a shot of a shotgun 
               with wire slowly pulling down on the trigger. Sing looks up, 
               and the trigger of that gun and six other shotguns pointing down 
               directly at him fire. Sing is hit, blood splattering against 
               him and the wall. We see only from his shoulders down. He spasms 
               for a moment, then falls forward to his knees. Cut to Tapp, who 
               is making strange vowel sounds, moving down the flight of stairs 
               just before the hallway where Sing now is.
 
               On his knees, Sing remains upright for a moment, spasming more. 
               We go to a shot of Jigsaw on the floor. Jigsaw starts moving 
               and gets himself up to his feet, and starts hobbling further 
               down the hall. Sings body finally falls forward onto the floor, 
               spasming still. Tapp continues down the stairs, falling against 
               the wall a couple of times. We see Jigsaw as he gets to the end 
               of the hall and starts sliding a large door open.
 
               At that moment, Tapp reaches the bottom of the stairs and turns 
               into the hallway, collapsing back into a sitting position on 
               the stairs. Jigsaw hobbles through the door and starts to go 
               left. Tapp sits up a bit and looks down the hall, where he sees 
               Sing, who has stopped spasming. His eyes widening, Tapp removes 
               the hand from his throat and reaches forward towards Sing, his 
               mouth opening and moving but no sound other than some gasping 
               coming out. The shot fades to a slow-paced black and white, and 
               then snaps into a few crime scene photos of Sings body, including 
               a nice gory one of the top of his head, part of which is now 
               missing.
 
               At the last photoflash, we cut back to a shot of Tapp presently, 
               sitting on his couch. The shot shows a good view of the scar 
               across his neck.
 
                                     TAPP
                         (weak, desperate) Had you...had you 
                         on your knees. (He sits forward, getting 
                         some things off the coffee table) Youre 
                         running. Youre running...(He gets up 
                         and goes over to the desk in the corner 
                         with the audio recording device and 
                         dozens of photos pinned to the wall, 
                         takes a seat) Youre running scared 
                         because we had you. Im going to close 
                         this case. Ram close it. (He picks up 
                         a small framed photograph, which we 
                         cant see, but likely, its of Sing.) 
                         Right, Sing? Right? Were gonna close 
                         it, Sing.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         X Marks the spot...(He stands, touching 
                         the pipe and looking up and around a 
                         bit.) X marks the spot...we need to 
                         search this room again. (He turns and 
                         looks over at Adam.) What are you doing 
                         over there?
 
               Cut back into regular view in the bathroom, with a shot of Adam 
               sitting on the tub, holding the photograph of Alison and Diana 
               just beneath the edge of the inside of the tub, looking down 
               at it. He ignores Lawrence, flipping the photo over.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (irritated) Excuse me?

                         (glancing up; calm irritation) Just 
                         because Im stuck in this room with 
                         you doesnt mean I have to report to 
                         you every ten seconds.

                         (sighs) I really dont see the point 
                         in us not helping one another.
 
                                     ADAM
                         well what do you want me to do? Im 
                         on a leash.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Thats exactly why we need to talk. 
                         We need to think!
 
                                     ADAM
                         I am thinking!

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (snapping at him) Well then dont keep 
                         me in the dark about what youre thinking!
 
                         
               There is a pause as something about that statement strikes Adam.
 
               
                                     ADAM
                         Turn off the lights.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         What?

                                     ADAM
                         (letting the photo fall into the tub 
                         as he stands) Turn them off now, please!
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (doesnt get it) Why?

                                     ADAM
                         (impatiently) Just turn them off for 
                         a second!
 
               Lawrence stares at him oddly but moves backwards, reaching over 
               and flipping off the lights. Adam looks around. Lawrence looks 
               around too, but he sees nothing. He doesnt seem to think this 
               is going to help any. Then we see on the wall next to him a glow 
               in the dark X painted on the tiles. He doesnt see it and shrugs, 
               but Adam spots it.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Jesus, behind you!

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (turns and sees it, is surprised) How 
                         come we didnt see that before?
 
                                     ADAM
                         The lights in here hadnt charged it. 
                         It must be glow in the dark paint or 
                         something.
 
               Lawrence turns and flips the lights back on, both of them wincing 
               slightly at the sudden transition from dark to bright white, 
               though not as much as before. Lawrence leans over and picks up 
               his hacksaw, going over to the tiles where the X is and starts 
               hitting the tiles with the handle of the hacksaw. He breaks through, 
               reaching into a small cavity in the wall and pulling out a small 
               brown box with a hinged lid. He cant believe it. He looks to 
               Adam, a small grin on his face. He places it on the floor and 
               sits down behind it.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (excitedly) Open it!

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (turns it around so we and Adam can 
                         see the small lock on it.) Its locked. 
                         (He pauses, thinking, then realizes 
                         something) The key, the one from my 
                         envelope. Where is it?
 
               Adam looks around him, then leans down, looking on the floor 
               for the key.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (soft, hushed tone as he looks) Where 
                         the fuck...Here. (He finds it, picks 
                         it up and tosses it over.)
 
               Lawrence picks up the key, tries it on the lock. It works. He 
               takes the lock off, opens the box. He holds up a cell phone, 
               smiling in relief.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (big smile) Cell phone. The most beautiful 
                         invention on this planet!
 
               Lawrence takes out and holds up one of two cigarettes. Adam lets 
               out a joyful laugh.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Make that second most beautiful invention! 
                         (He reaches out his hand for Lawrence 
                         to toss it.) Give me that.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Are you joking? Youre gonna put something 
                         we found in this room in your mouth?
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (pause, then) Yes, Im willing to risk 
                         it! Give me that sweet cancer. (Lawrence 
                         ignores his request, tosses out the 
                         other cigarette and a lighter. He finds 
                         lastly a small folded up note with the 
                         words Shh, Doctor, written on it.) I 
                         dont care, I really dont. Give me 
                         one of those.
 
               Jigsaws voiceover reads whats written on the note as Lawrence 
               opens the paper and reads it, keeping it low in the box where 
               Adam cant see it.
 
                                     JIGSAW
                         (VO) The cigarettes are harmless, I 
                         promise. Smoking is only poisonous when 
                         it ends in bloodshed. Think about this 
                         - you dont need a gun to kill Adam.
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (growing impatient) May I please have 
                         a cigarette?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (ignoring his plea) Im trying the police. 
                         (He flips open and dials on the cell 
                         phone, but a weird beeping noise indicating 
                         the call cant go through comes from 
                         the phone. He dials again, same result.) 
                         Shit. (Pause, thinks.) This was meant 
                         to receive calls, not make them. (A 
                         moment; he realizes something.) Wait 
                         a minute...this has happened before.
 
                         
               Cut back to an overhead descending view inside a parking garage.
 
               
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (VO) Last night, after I finished at 
                         the hospital. (fade into another closer 
                         shot of the cars, and Lawrence walking 
                         down the corridor, carrying his briefcase.) 
                         I was walking back to my car. (He stops 
                         a moment) I thought I was alone, but 
                         Im sure someone else was there. (He 
                         squints, bringing his hand up over his 
                         eyes. There is a flash from the side. 
                         He looks up, startled, looking in the 
                         direction in which he thinks it came 
                         from, but sees nothing. He looks around 
                         him for another moment, then continues 
                         forward to his car.)
 
               Cut to a shot within a circular overhead mirror of Lawrences 
               car pulling up to an abandoned security gate station. He gets 
               out of the car, shutting the door and going over to a phone on 
               the wall to dial security to let him out. When he dials, though, 
               it gives him a busy signal. As it beeps, we cut to another shot 
               of his car in the mirror. The back door on the passenger side 
               starts to slowly open. Back to Lawrence, who hangs up the phone, 
               aggravated, and reaches into his pocket for his cell phone. He 
               opens it and dials. Back in the mirror, we see something get 
               out of the car on its hands and knees. It is in a red robe and 
               has a strangely shaped head with long, tangly dark hair. Lawrence 
               finishes dialing, holds the phone to his ear but receives the 
               same beeping tone as the phone in the bathroom, indicating that 
               he cannot make outgoing calls. Perplexed, he holds up the phone, 
               trying to get a better signal. Alongside the car, the thing moves 
               even closer now. It gets up slowly. We see that it is wearing 
               the strange boar mask previously seen in the flashback of Jigsaws 
               workshop. It suddenly rushes upon him as hes distracted with 
               his phone and grabs him.
 
               Cut back to Lawrence sitting on the floor in the bathroom, still 
               holding the phone.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (His eyes distant, off in his memory) 
                         That...thing. It was waiting for me. 
                         (He exhales sharply, then looks back 
                         up at Adam. Adam is just standing there, 
                         staring at him. Something seems a bit...off. 
                         With a suspicious tone, Lawrence addresses 
                         him.) How did you know to turn off the 
                         lights?
 
                                     ADAM
                         Who cares? It worked.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Yeah, but how did you know?

                                     ADAM
                         (a slight pause) Instinct. (His tone 
                         is far from believable.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (doesnt believe a word of it) Instinct?
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         Yeah.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         You know what? (he looks down, then 
                         back up at Adam.) Youre a terrible 
                         liar.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (quiet offense) You say that like you 
                         know me.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (speaks calmly, but anger lies underneath 
                         the surface) What else arent you telling 
                         me?
 
                                     ADAM
                         (cocky and sarcastic) Well, um, lets 
                         see. On my sixth birthday, my best friend 
                         at that time, Scott Tibbs, stabbed me 
                         with a rusty nail. I didnt tell you 
                         about that. I didnt tell you that 
                         my last girlfriend, (Lawrence lowers 
                         his head into his hands. Un-FUCKING-believable) 
                         who was a feminist vegan punk, broke 
                         up with me because she thought I was 
                         too angry. Uh, I havent told you that 
                         one of my toenails is slightly...
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (snaps at him, fed up) Just stop it. 
                         You knew to turn off these lights.
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (turning away from Lawrence) What-ever.
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (stands up, frustrated.) Im dealing 
                         with a juvenile.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (has had it, looks right at him) You 
                         wanna know?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (exasperated) Yeah!

               Adam leans down and reaches into the bathtub, pulls out and holds 
               up the picture of Alison and Diana.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (with a somewhat aggressive attitude) 
                         Here it is. (He throws it towards Lawrence, 
                         who looks down at it, then back up at 
                         Adam before getting down on the floor 
                         and pulling it towards him with the 
                         hinged box. He picks it up, sitting 
                         up as he looks upon it with shock. )
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (very softly, shakily) Oh God...(he 
                         turns it over, then back. Adam casts 
                         his eyes downwards, still standing but 
                         cooling off, feeling bad for Lawrence) 
                         W...where did you get this?
 
                                     ADAM
                         (softly) It was in your wallet, behind 
                         the photo of your daughter.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         W...why didnt you show me this before?
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         I couldnt. (Lawrence begins to shakily 
                         sob, touching the photo.) Im sorry. 
                         (Adam goes over and sits against a pipe 
                         in his corner, lowering his head and 
                         upper body forward, holding his head 
                         in his hands.)
 
               Lawrence sniffles, shaking, then looks right to the surveillance 
               camera behind the glass and screams.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         What are you doing to them you bastard?! 
                         (He goes back to huddling over the photograph, 
                         sniffling and crying for a moment. Then, 
                         he sits up, trying to pull himself together) 
                         Okay...okay..(he looks around a bit) 
                         Okay, Ive got to think now...(He looks 
                         down, sees the note again in the box.)
 
                         
                                     JIGSAW
                         (VO) Think about this...you dont need 
                         a gun to kill Adam. When theres that 
                         much poison in your blood (a slow shot 
                         moving to the pool of blood from the 
                         body in front of Lawrence), the only 
                         thing left to do is shoot yourself.
 
                         
               Lawrence looks at the body, then down. Hes getting an idea. 
               He takes a cigarette, glances over at Adam, who still has his 
               head down in his hands. He dips the end of the cigarette in the 
               blood, then puts it back in the box. He starts to get up. Adam 
               looks up, sees him standing.
 
                                     ADAM
                         What are you doing?

               Lawrence goes to the light, looks at the camera, suddenly flips 
               off the lights. We see a shot of Zep startling when the lights 
               go out on the monitor, then we go back to the darkened bathroom.
 
               
                                     ADAM
                         Hey! What the hell are you doing?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (whispering so the surveillance camera 
                         will not pick him up) Adam, listen to 
                         me. I want you to play along with me 
                         on this.
 
               Zep leans in, trying to hear whats being said, but the static 
               of the video is too loud. He tries to adjust the sound, but to 
               no avail. Shot goes back into the bathroom, where Lawrence is 
               finishing saying something to Adam.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         You got that? (he turns the lights back 
                         on, both of them again wincing at the 
                         bright light. Lawrence glances at the 
                         surveillance camera, then looks to Adam.
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (trying to be nonchalant) So you uh, 
                         still want that cigarette?
 
                                     ADAM
                         Um...yeah, sure.

               Lawrence makes a show of reaching into the box where the poisoned 
               cigarette is, but takes the other un-dipped one instead. He throws 
               it to Adam, who reaches down and picks it up from where it lands. 
               Lawrence throws the lighter as well. Adam puts the cigarette 
               between his lips and reaches down, picking up the lighter. He 
               glances over at Lawrence, who watches him intently. Adam just 
               shrugs then lights up. He takes a long drag, then exhales in 
               a sigh of relief and with a smile. He takes another drag then 
               suddenly freezes, his head jerking and a strange gurgling sound 
               coming from his throat. His head jerks more then the rest of 
               his body, his eyes widening. His hand drops the cigarette and 
               goes to his throat as he turns, still jerky and making a strange, 
               almost squeaky choking sound in his throat. The sound grows louder 
               as he falls to his knees, then back a bit, his left arm held 
               out in front of him dramatically. He falls backwards onto the 
               floor, twitching some more, still choking. He lets out a long 
               cough, suddenly stops jerking, and closes his eyes. The death 
               in its entirety is very, very fake.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (watches Adam, then turns to the surveillance 
                         camera, speaks with angry finality) 
                         There! Ive done it! Ive killed him 
                         with the poison, just like you wanted. 
                         (shouting) Now wheres my family?! Where 
                         are they?!
 
               Suddenly, we go to a shot of Adam lying there and a loud, electrical 
               buzzing sound is heard as his body jerks to life and he cries 
               out. He spasms and jerks around as he is electrocuted, and Lawrence 
               looks upon him in shock. Finally, the electrocution stops, and 
               Adam sits up slightly, gasping, eyes wide.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (he shrieks in pain and shock) Jesus 
                         Christ!!
 
               Lawrences reaction is not one of concern; he simply cant believe 
               that Adam just screwed up the plan.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (disbelief) What?

                                     ADAM
                         (wide eyed) I just got electrocuted!
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         What? (he rolls his eyes. Unbelievable. 
                         He speaks in a hushed tone.) That was 
                         our way out!
 
               Adam looks at him in shock, cannot believe Lawrence would think 
               hed make something like that up.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (yelling at him) Did you hear what I 
                         said? (he desperately grabs at the manacle 
                         around his ankle, pulling at it and 
                         shrieking) Get this thing off me! Get 
                         it off!
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (pissed off) Stop acting!

                                     ADAM
                         (stops pulling at the manacle and chains; 
                         now hes pissed at Lawrence for his 
                         disbelief) You think I would make that 
                         up just to mess up your stupid fucking 
                         charade?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (gives up on Adam, frustrated once more) 
                         All right, thats it! (He leans over 
                         and picks up his saw, sits down and 
                         starts trying to saw through his chains 
                         again, grunting. Adam, in the meantime, 
                         just sits back against the wall, breathing 
                         heavily, looking dazed. Lawrence continues 
                         to franticly saw, but it doesnt work. 
                         He gets pissed off and throws the blade 
                         down.) Ah, Damn it!!
 
               Back to Adam, still looking dazed. Suddenly, a look of realization 
               dawns upon his face. The electrocution has jogged his memory.
 
               
                                     ADAM
                         (wide-eyed) I remember everything now. 
                         (Lawrence glances over at him.) I remember 
                         how I got here.
 
               Flashback to Adam walking up the stairs in his apartment building, 
               a camera around his neck, smoking a cigarette and listening to 
               music on his headphones. He walks with an uncaring, slow swagger. 
               He gets to the top of the stairs and walks down a red-lit hallway 
               to his apartment. He goes inside, closing the door behind him 
               then moving into the kitchen area, throwing his keys onto the 
               table and opening the fridge. The entire apartment is very rundown, 
               decrepit, dingy and old; truly a shithole apartment as Adam described 
               it earlier. There is graffiti on the door and walls, the wallpaper 
               is fading and peeling, the refrigerator is dirty.
 
               Adam opens the fridge and looks inside for a moment. He sighs, 
               then closes the door. He heads over to his darkroom, closing 
               the door behind him. The lighting is dark red. He puts the camera 
               down on the table, taking the strap off from around his neck, 
               takes off his headphones and cd player, presses stop and puts 
               them down off to the side. He sighs tiredly and goes over to 
               a tray where a photo is developing and picks it up with his fingers, 
               ganging it with a closepin on a hanging line with other photos. 
               It is a picture of a man wearing sunglasses. The man is in fact 
               Lawrence. To the left of that one is a shot of Lawrence in the 
               parking garage with his hand over his eyes.
 
               The camera cuts to a shot of the newest photo through a peephole 
               in the darkroom door as the camera fades out and back, viewing 
               the grafittied door of the darkroom before the shot fades to 
               black, industrial music playing over the shot.
 
               Cut to Adam sleeping in the now pitch-black darkroom, his head 
               down on the table. He wakes up abruptly, as though he hadnt 
               meant to fall asleep. He looks around, confused, wondering why 
               all the lights out. He gives a Great, another problem type of 
               sigh. He stands and yawns, reaching over for the lightswitch. 
               He moves it up and down a few times, but nothing happens. Another 
               aggravated sigh. He reaches down and finds a flashlight on the 
               counter, presses the on button but it doesnt work. Pissed, he 
               shakes it hard, trying to get it to come on, but that doesnt 
               work. He looks at it, scoffs.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Great.

               Suddenly, he hears something move outside the door, somewhere 
               in his apartment. On alert, he listens. He looks down and picks 
               up his camera, slinging it around his neck and holding it out 
               in front of him. He opens the creaky door into his also pitch-black 
               apartment. He takes a few steps forward, speaks nervously, but 
               trying to be brave.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Is someone there? (he takes a picture, 
                         the flash lighting up the area in front 
                         of him.) I can hear you. (He takes another 
                         picture, the flash lighting up a living 
                         room area. Nothing yet. He moves forward 
                         more, into the kitchen entryway, snapping 
                         away for light.)
 
               Suddenly, from behind him, an EVIL DOLL LAUGH is heard. He startles, 
               spinning around.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (his voice alarmed but confused at the 
                         same time) What the...? (He snaps a 
                         picture in its direction and sees the 
                         Puppet from Jigsaws workshop and video 
                         sitting in an armchair, continuing its 
                         evil laugh.) Christ! (He reaches down 
                         and finds a baseball bat on the floor, 
                         and starts hitting the doll as hard 
                         as he can until the laugh starts to 
                         fade and then just dies out. ) What 
                         the...
 
               He hears the sound of movement again, coming from just behind 
               him in a closet. He goes on alert again, holding up the baseball 
               bat and the camera.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Who is that?! Whos in there?! (he moves 
                         towards the door, shaking but trying 
                         to be a tough guy) Come on out! Ill 
                         kill you, you motherfucker! (He opens 
                         the door, holds the camera and takes 
                         a picture. As soon as the flash goes 
                         off we see the red-robed pig thing that 
                         originally grabbed Lawrence quickly 
                         move forward and grab Adam.)
 
               Suddenly, the cell phone rings. Lawrence looks down at it in 
               slight surprise. Adam snaps out of his daze to look at it as 
               well. Lawrence glances over at Adam and then carefully reaches 
               down, picks it up and answers it. The scene will cut back and 
               forth to Diana and Alison in the room and Lawrence on the phone 
               for the duration of the conversation.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (not sure what to expect) Who is this?
 
                         
                                     DIANA
                         (on the phone, sobbing) Daddy?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Diana? (he stands)

                                     DIANA
                         Daddy, is that you? (cut to a shot of 
                         her being held by Zep, the phone to 
                         her ear.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (getting sniffly) Yeah baby, its me. 
                         Im here. (Adam watches him intently)
 
                         
                                     DIANA
                         (sobbing) Im scared, Daddy.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (trying his best to reassure her) Dont 
                         worry honey, everythings going to be 
                         okay. Wheres Mommy?
 
                                     DIANA
                         Shes here with me.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (Staying as calm and collected as he 
                         can for his daughter) Let me talk to 
                         her sweetie, okay? Put Mommy on.
 
                                     DIANA
                         The bad man from my room is here. He 
                         has us tied up and he has a gun.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         W...what man?

                                     DIANA
                         Please come home Daddy! (Zep kisses 
                         her on the top of her head and takes 
                         the phone away to give to Alison.)
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Hello? Hello? Diana?

               Zep pushes some of Alisons hair behind her ear with the barrel 
               of the gun.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (desperate) Diana! Diana!

               Zep puts the phone up to Alisons ear.

                                     ALISON
                         Larry?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Ally? Is that you? (We see a shot of 
                         Alison giving a threatening look through 
                         her tears to Zep.)
 
                                     ALISON
                         Is Adam there?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (surprised, looks to Adam, who continues 
                         to watch him worriedly) How do you know? 
                         Ally, what is going on?
 
                                     ALISON
                         (through her sobs, trying to calm them 
                         and get this message to him) Dont believe 
                         Adams lies. He knows you. He knew all 
                         about you before today. (Zep quickly 
                         takes the phone away, hangs up. Cut 
                         back to the bathroom, Lawrence on the 
                         phone.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (a dial tone is heard from the other 
                         end hanging up. Lawrence is desperate) 
                         Hello? Ally? Ally? (No answer, just 
                         the dial tone. He stands up.) Hello? 
                         (He looks to the surveillance camera, 
                         screaming) God damn you! If you so much 
                         as lay a finger on them, Ill kill you! 
                         You hear me? You son of a bitch! Ill 
                         kill you! (He sits down, leaning forward 
                         over the floor, crying a bit. He slams 
                         his fist fiercely against the floor.)
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (quietly, as though cautiously approaching 
                         a dangerous animal) Are they okay?
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (sits up. His voice is calmer, but rage 
                         is clearly underneath the surface) My 
                         wife, she uh, she mentioned your name.
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (a brief Oh shit look appears in his 
                         eyes, but he acts surprised) What did 
                         she say?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (not looking at him yet. Speaks very 
                         firmly, trying to suppress his rage.) 
                         She told me...not to believe you.
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (cannot even look at Lawrence.) Believe 
                         me about what? (There is no doubt hes 
                         hiding something)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (Finally turns to look at him, the look 
                         of 1000 deaths) She told me you knew 
                         me. (He stands, looming menacingly, 
                         the look stronger on his face) Who are 
                         you?
 
                                     ADAM
                         (still trying to cover up and losing, 
                         still not making eye contact) You know 
                         who I am.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (snaps, shouting at him) Stop the lies! 
                         Youre a liar! I need to know the truth!
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (His tone changes, hes had it with 
                         hiding, had it with Lawrence) Im a 
                         liar? (Finally, he looks up, right at 
                         Lawrence. His voice is firm and accusing.) 
                         What did you do last night, Lawrence? 
                         Work at a hospital? Saving sick children? 
                         You told me that after you left your 
                         house last night, you went to work at 
                         a hospital.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (defensively) Thats because its the 
                         truth.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (almost deadly) No its not. Your wife 
                         is right, Larry. (Lawrence is now the 
                         one wearing the Oh shit look.) You dont 
                         recall getting your picture taken in 
                         that parking lot?
 
               Brief flashback shot of Lawrence in the parking garage, pausing 
               and covering his eyes for a moment when the camera flashed. We 
               see a shot of Adam holding the camera and taking the shot from 
               around a corner, ducking back behind the column. Lawrence looks 
               up at the flash, startled.
 
               Cut back to the bathroom. Adam stands up, his stance and body 
               language accusing of Lawrence. He speaks fiercely, disgusted 
               with Lawrences two-faced bullshit.
 
                                     ADAM
                         I can prove that you didnt go anywhere 
                         near a hospital last night. (He leans 
                         over and pulls out the garbage bag from 
                         the tub. Lawrence stands, staring at 
                         him in near disbelief. He has been caught. 
                         Adam takes a handful of photos from 
                         the baggie hed kept hidden inside the 
                         garbage bag, holds them up and throws 
                         them down, scattering them.) Its not 
                         the first time Ive done it either, 
                         Larry. (Lawrence leans over to look 
                         at the photos on the floor in front 
                         of him with complete and utter disbelief, 
                         picking one up and looking down at it) 
                         Ive been taking pictures of you for 
                         a few days now. (Shots of some of Adams 
                         pictures. Lawrence going into a building, 
                         Lawrence at an outdoor café eating lunch.)
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (still holding the photograph) But...why?
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         You wanna know what I do? I get paid 
                         to take pictures of rich guys like you 
                         who go to seedy, out-of-the-way motels 
                         to fuck their secretaries. (we start 
                         seeing more shots Adam took while following 
                         Lawrence) Last night I went to your 
                         house. (Flashback of Adam holding his 
                         camera, then cut to several photographs 
                         of Lawrence leaving his house, glancing 
                         over his shoulder and moving down the 
                         sidewalk) I watched you leave. I followed 
                         you (Lawrence in the parking garage, 
                         photographs of the exterior of the Hotel 
                         Barfly. Lawrence inside the hotel, knocking 
                         on the door to one of the rooms while 
                         Adam hides around the corner with his 
                         camera) all the way to that shitbag 
                         hotel. (Photographs of Lawrence standing 
                         outside then going into the room.)
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (calm with rage just beneath the surface) 
                         Youve uh, had these with you the whole 
                         time?
 
                                     ADAM
                         I found them, in there (points to the 
                         toilet; quick flashback of Adam pulling 
                         the bag out of the top of the toilet, 
                         then Adam opening the bag and seeing 
                         the hacksaws and a glimpse of something 
                         else in the bag.) with the hacksaws. 
                         (Flashback of Adam tossing the bag into 
                         the bathtub while Lawrence isnt looking.) 
                         I dont know how they got there.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (angry) Yeah, right. Youre so full 
                         of it! (He angrily crumples up and throws 
                         the photo he was holding at Adam)
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (scoffing tone) Aww, face it, Larry, 
                         were both bulls hitters. But my camera 
                         isnt. It doesnt know how to lie. It 
                         only shows you whats put right in front 
                         of it. Just out of curiosity, what did 
                         you do in that motel room? You got out 
                         of there pretty fast.
 
               Cut to a flashback, the hotel room. Carla, the pretty Asian girl 
               from the hospital, is inside the room, now in a black lacy top 
               and a gray/blue skirt, waiting for him. She opens the door, taking 
               a step back as he enters. He looks unsure of the whole situation, 
               a changed attitude this evening from all the others. He shuts 
               the door behind him, and Carla smiles at him. Lawrences tone 
               when he speaks is unhappy. Not enraged, just somewhat disapproving.
 
               
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Why did you um, deem it necessary to 
                         page me when you knew I was at home?
 
                         
                                     CARLA
                         I didnt know if you were going to make 
                         it. (turns, goes and sits on the bed.)
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (sounding very business-like) But I 
                         gave you a precise time at which to 
                         page me. (He puts the briefcase on a 
                         chair by the door then goes over and 
                         sits down next to her on the bed.) You 
                         cant do that.
 
                                     CARLA
                         Its not like I know the rules for this 
                         sort of stuff. (She starts unbuttoning 
                         her shirt. Lawrence holds out his hand 
                         and stops her. She looks up at him, 
                         concerned.) Whats wrong, Dr. Gordon?
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (a sigh in his voice) Look, it was wrong 
                         for me to makes you come here.
 
                                     CARLA
                         (confused, hurt) But I thought we-
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         -Please. (very softly) Im sorry. (He 
                         stands and heads over to the door. Carla 
                         remains sitting on the bed. She sniffles 
                         slightly but doesnt cry.)
 
               Suddenly, the hotel room phone rings. Carla and Lawrence both 
               look at it, unsure, startled. Carla looks to Lawrence.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         You tell anyone you were here?

                                     CARLA
                         No. (She stands, goes over to the phone 
                         and answers it.) Hello? (She listens, 
                         turns to Lawrence) Its for you. (She 
                         holds out the phone.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         For me? (He walks over, takes the phone.) 
                         Hello?
 
               The voice on the other end is male, slightly raspy. It is unidentifiable; 
               it could be either Tapp or Zep, or someone else. It is very accusing.
 
               
                                     VOICE
                         I know what youre doing...Doctor.
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         I- (but the other person hangs up, and 
                         a dial tone is heard)
 
               Lawrence hangs up the phone, turns and moves to the door. Carla 
               moves with him, watching, waiting for him to say who it was.
 
               
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (nervous) I have to go.

                                     CARLA
                         What happened?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Ive got to go. (He picks up his briefcase 
                         from the chair, and heads out the door.
 
                         
               Cut to the underground parking lot, the same shot as where Adam 
               took Lawrences picture. He walks along, pauses to wince and 
               cover his eyes, then the flash. He looks up startled.
 
               The shot cuts back to Lawrence leaning forward against the wall 
               in his corner, hand against a pipe. He slowly looks up at Adam, 
               thinking of something.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Who was it?

                                     ADAM
                         Who was what?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         The person who paid you to follow me, 
                         who was it?
 
                                     ADAM
                         (internal shrug) He calls himself Bob 
                         and he gives me the money up front. 
                         Two hundred bucks a night. If Id have 
                         known I was gonna end up here, I wouldve 
                         asked for a hell of a lot more.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (pissy) What does that mean? Does that 
                         mean you saw what happened to me?
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (internal eye roll; speaks as though 
                         hes been over this 100 times before) 
                         What I saw was you get into your car. 
                         Thats it. I didnt ask your name. I 
                         didnt know who you were. I dont know 
                         how I got here, I dont know how you 
                         got here. I just took the shots (As 
                         he speaks, a quick flashback of Adam 
                         taking a picture, going up apartment 
                         stairs, then in the darkroom) and went 
                         straight home to develop the. Next thing 
                         I know Im chained to a pipe in some 
                         prehistoric bathroom, staring at the 
                         guy Ive been taking shots of all night.
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (seeing a major break in this mystery) 
                         Clearly, whoever paid you to take the 
                         pictures of me is the one who put is 
                         in here.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (they dont know that for sure) Maybe.
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Maybe? What do you mean maybe? Of course 
                         it is! What did he look like?
 
                                     ADAM
                         (internal shrug) I dont know, he was 
                         just a guy. (Shot of inside Adams apartment 
                         and an unidentifiable figure towards 
                         the back of the room, the image darkened 
                         so we cant make him out. The figure 
                         slowly takes a step towards us/Adam)
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Was he tall, was he skinny, obese, what?
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         I dont take notes about his appearance. 
                         (Shot inside apartment, the figure moves 
                         closer)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (aggravated, how can he not remember 
                         anything?) You must remember something 
                         about him.
 
                                     ADAM
                         I cant. (Shot of inside the apartment, 
                         the figure moves closer)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Youre telling me you dont remember 
                         a thing about the guy?
 
                                     ADAM
                         I told you, I- (inside apartment, the 
                         figure moves closer, just about close 
                         enough for identification)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (enraged, throwing his hands up) Oh 
                         for fucks sake! I give up!
 
                                     ADAM
                         (gives up his playing dumb tone, gives 
                         in due to irritation with Lawrence) 
                         Hes a tall black guy, hes got a scar 
                         around his neck, okay? (Shot of inside 
                         the apartment, the figure moves into 
                         a viewable light; It is Tapp.)
 
               Lawrence is leaning against the wall facing away from Adam. At 
               hearing Adams description, he slowly moves back, turns around 
               to face Adam.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Tapp! (shot of inside Adams apartment, 
                         Tapp handing us/Adam money. Adams/our 
                         hand reaches out and takes it quickly. 
                         Then, back to Lawrence) Detective Tapp!
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         Whoa, the guy who paid me to take these 
                         photos was not a cop.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         No, no, he was discharged from the police 
                         force. (Shot of Tapp at his desk with 
                         the Amanda video, looking at notes.) 
                         He broke down after his partner was 
                         killed (Tapp and Sing sitting next to 
                         each other in Lawrences office), but 
                         that didnt stop him from harassing 
                         me. (Lawrence sitting in the car next 
                         to Tapp) The guy became obsessed. (Tapp 
                         in his current apartment adjusting the 
                         camera in the window, then a shot of 
                         him leaning over a notebook, going over 
                         notes.) Hes convinced himself that 
                         I must have somehow been involved with 
                         the murders. Hes...hes crazy. (Tapp 
                         at the corner desk in his apartment, 
                         giving a crazy-sounding Heh heh heh 
                         laugh. The shot cuts back to Lawrence, 
                         who points accusingly at Adam.) And 
                         you helped him. (disgusted) You took 
                         money from him to invade my privacy. 
                         How could you do that?
 
                                     ADAM
                         (bite me tone) Call it my need to eat.
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (sarcastic) Right, right. You know what 
                         Adam? Youre not a victim of this game, 
                         youre a part of it. (Points accusingly 
                         at him as he says this.)
 
                                     ADAM
                         Oh really? Obviously this cop thinks 
                         youre the one behind it all.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (Facing into the corner of his cell, 
                         turning around slightly, internal eye 
                         roll.) I told you, hes not a cop. Hes 
                         a bottom feeder, just like you. (A slight 
                         sneer from Lawrence at Adam. Lawrence 
                         turns back into his corner)
 
                                     ADAM
                         (getting REALLY pissed at Lawrences 
                         attitude towards him) What are you more 
                         pissed off about? The fact that I took 
                         some shots of you or the fact that I 
                         took some shots of you while you were 
                         cheating on your wife?
 
               Lawrence spins out of his corner, screaming in rage.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         I did not cheat on her!!!

                                     ADAM
                         What do you care what I think anyway? 
                         I dont give a crap if you covered yourself 
                         in peanut butter and had a 15-hooker 
                         gang bang!
 
               A pause, then Lawrence collapses onto the floor. Hes lost the 
               last of any strength, level headedness or control he had before.
 
               
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (weakly) How did I get here? (Adam sits 
                         down on the pipe in his corner, leaning 
                         forward a bit.) I had...I had everything 
                         in order. (he lays down on his side, 
                         facing Adam, who watches him with sympathy) 
                         My whole life was in perfect order. 
                         (He holds up and looks at the picture 
                         of Alison and Diana gagged.)
 
               Cut to the Gordons Bedroom. Zep puts Alisons gag back on her, 
               then leaves the room. Alison moves her head around to loosen 
               the gag then spits it out. She tries to fight her sobs as she 
               speaks softly to Diana.
 
                                     ALISON
                         Sweetheart, are you okay? (Diana shakes 
                         her head no) Mommy just needs you to 
                         be really, really, really strong right 
                         now. Im not gonna let anybody hurt 
                         you. You got that? (Diana nods) Okay, 
                         thats my good girl. (She starts crying 
                         as her hands work behind her to loosen 
                         the rope around them.)
 
               Cut back to Adam in the bathroom, looking up slightly from his 
               position. He glances back down at the photographs on the floor, 
               notices something odd about one of them. He furrows his brow 
               and gets down on his hands and knees, reaching over and picking 
               it up, leaning back and looking at it, studying it. Camera cuts 
               to a shot of Lawrence through the black and white surveillance 
               camera, sitting on the floor. Adams next line is a voice over 
               over this shot.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Hey, was there someone else at your 
                         house last night besides your wife and 
                         daughter?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (on camera) No.

                                     ADAM
                         (still on camera) Well, theres someone 
                         here. (He tosses the photo to Lawrence, 
                         whosits up, picks it up and looks at 
                         it. After a moment, the shot cuts back 
                         to a regular view of them, in the room.)
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (realization) I know him. (We see the 
                         photo as well. It is a shot looking 
                         up into Lawrences window, with Zep 
                         standing there, looking out, completely 
                         unaware of his picture being taken.) 
                         Zep! (Cut to a shot of Zep listening. 
                         The shot goes back and forth between 
                         him as his eyes widen while Lawrence 
                         makes his threats.) His name is Zep. 
                         Hes an orderly at my hospital. (his 
                         voice becomes a growl, furious) Zep. 
                         You perverted little psychopath. Im 
                         gonna take great pleasure in seeing 
                         you pay for this! You bastard fuck!
 
                         
               Suddenly the shot cuts to Adam, who looks up at the clock with 
               a very worried look. He points up to it.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Look. (Lawrence momentarily breaks from 
                         his Zep rage, looks up. The clock reads 
                         at 6:00.) Were out of time.
 
                                     DIANA
                         (crying) Mommy help me!

               Alison continues to untie her. Cut to Zep, getting up from his 
               chair, turning to go into the bedroom. Alison hears him moving 
               near, sees his form through the frosted glass doors. She quickly 
               replaces Dianas gag and then her own, and resumes her position 
               with her hands behind her back just as the doors open and Zep 
               steps into the room. He looks down at them, raises his eyebrows 
               slightly. He seems to have gotten himself together, ready to 
               just do what has to be done. He takes the gun from his belt and 
               leans down next to Alison. He looks at her with wide eyes, shakes 
               his head sadly. He speaks calmly.
 
                                     ZEP
                         Dr. Gordons time is up. Now Ive gotta 
                         do what Ive gotta do, and...Im afraid 
                         it has to be you that tells him he failed. 
                         (He undoes her gag, holds the phone 
                         to her head and his gun in front of 
                         her chest.)
 
               Quick cut to the bathroom, where Lawrence is still looking at 
               the slightly crumpled picture of Zep in the window. The phone 
               rings, startling them both. Lawrence quickly answers it.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (speaking quickly, the growling voice) 
                         Is that you Zep, you bastard!? (Adam 
                         gets up from his corner, moves forward 
                         slightly) I know its you, you son of 
                         a bitch!
 
                                     ALISON
                         Larry?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (his eyes widen, his fierce tone replaced 
                         with worry) Ally?
 
               Cut into the bedroom.

                                     ALISON
                         (looking right at Zep, firmly) You failed.
 
                         
               Quickly, she grabs Zeps gun and pushes him hard over to her 
               left. He is taken by surprise and goes down easily.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (who can only hear the sound of a struggle) 
                         Hello? Hello?
 
               Alison rips the gun right from his hand, quickly backs up an 
               stands. She keeps the gun aimed right at Zep. He sits up slightly, 
               trying to slowly get up, but she keeps the gun fiercely aimed 
               at him, keeping him there. His eyes are wide, likely his one 
               thought right now is Fuck.
 
                                     ALISON
                         Dont move, stay on the ground. Give 
                         me the phone. Give it to me! (He sits 
                         up a bit, carefully slides it to her. 
                         He is watching her, looking for an opportunity 
                         to overcome her once again. She picks 
                         the phone up, still keeping her eyes 
                         and her gun at him.) Larry?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Ally! Honey, are you all right?

                                     ALISON
                         No! No were not...(Zep starts to move 
                         up a bit more, his right hand out, leaning 
                         against the edge of the bed. Ally threatens 
                         him more fiercely with the gun.) Get 
                         down! Larry, where are you?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (unsure himself) I dont know. Im being 
                         held captive in a room somewhere.
 
                         
                                     ALISON
                         (disbelief; she sniffles a bit) What? 
                         What are you talking about?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (starting to cry) Im so sorry, Ally.
 
                         
                                     ALISON
                         (desperate) Honey, we need you here. 
                         (Zep slowly readies himself to move 
                         forward, wide eyes still staring at 
                         Alison.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (crying, apologizing) Im sorry for 
                         everything. Its my fault. Please forgive 
                         me. Ive always been happy with you.
 
                         
                                     DIANA
                         (cries out) Mommy!

               Alison turns to look at Diana when she calls her, and Zep seizes 
               the moment. He leaps up and grabs the gun from her hand, and 
               they start struggling with it. Diana starts screaming. Lawrence, 
               on his end, hears the screaming and sounds of a struggle. In 
               wrestling for the gun a shot is let off, and Diana continues 
               to scream.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (panicked) Ally!

               Cut to a shot of static on Tapps TV set, then Tapp waking up 
               to the sound of gunfire. He quickly looks over to the window.
 
               
               Back to Zep and Alison, who are still fighting for the gun. Zep 
               manages to spin her around and into a leaning forward position, 
               but she still holds on tight. Another shot goes off. Cut to a 
               shot of Tapp, who hears it, then looks at the TV. He sees the 
               flash from the window on the television. He picks up his handgun 
               and loads it quickly, gets up and heads out. Back in the apartment, 
               we see Diana cowering, still tied, holding her teddy bear. Zep 
               gets behind Diana, tries to grab her but she keeps her arms and 
               the gun upwards. Another shot is fired off.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (screams) Ally! (Adam watches him with 
                         wide eyes.)
 
               The shot cuts back into the bedroom.

                                     DIANA
                         Mommy, help me!

               The struggle moves over and into the dresser. Zep gets the gun 
               in his right hand and wraps his left arm around Alison, who quickly 
               pulls open and takes out of the top drawer a pair of scissors. 
               She spins around and with a scream stabs Zep in his left leg. 
               He screams in pain and goes down, falling onto his side, clutching 
               his leg by a wooden column, moaning in pain. Alison quickly goes 
               over and finishes untying Diana. Cut to the Main Hall of the 
               residence, where we see Tapp enter and move down the hall with 
               his gun ready. He moves cautiously but quickly. He sees Zep on 
               the floor squirming around and aims at him, screaming.
 
                                     TAPP
                         Freeze!

               Zep turns and sees him, fires a shot in his direction but doesnt 
               hit. Tapp fires back and skims the top of Zeps head. Zep clutches 
               the surface wound, fires back. Cut back to Lawrence on the phone, 
               hearing only his daughter screaming and gunshots. He sobs, collapsing 
               forward onto the floor, crying out Oh no. Adam watches him, can 
               only imagine what hes hearing.
 
               Back to the bedroom, Tapp stands next to another wooden column 
               and fires at Zep again, missing. Alison finishes untying Diana 
               and the book from the room. Zep fires at Tapp again and misses. 
               Tapp fires back, but his gun jams. Zep sees Alison and Diana 
               run from the room, and his attention goes to them once more.
 
               
                                     TAPP
                         (trying to fix his gun) What the fuck?
 
                         
               Zep gets up off the floor more, but just then Tapp gives up on 
               his gun and charges at Zep, screaming. He tackles Zep, knocking 
               him flat on his back. Zep pushes his way up but Tapp grabs him 
               from behind, pulling him towards him. Cut back to Lawrence, still 
               on the floor, sobbing with the phone clutched in his hand.
 
               
               Back to Tapp and Zep, who get up to their feet. Zep grabs a vase 
               on the floor and turns, smashing it over Tapps head. The blow 
               stuns Tapp and sends him down. Zep kneels down and picks up his 
               gun, then gets back up and starts hobbling after Alison and Diana. 
               He reaches the living room, but they are no where to be seen.
 
               
                                     ZEP
                         Mrs. Gordon? (drops old cartridge out 
                         of his gun, pops in a new one) Diana?! 
                         (His breathing is fast, desperate. He 
                         clutches the wound on his leg.) Im 
                         gonna kill your husband now, Mrs. Gordon. 
                         (He stands up a bit straighter and hobbles 
                         over to the computer station, taking 
                         keys from the desk and then hobbling 
                         down the hall and out the door. We see 
                         Tapp groaning, starting to get up. Zep 
                         glances over and sees Tapp get to his 
                         feet, but quickly hobbles to the doorway 
                         and out the door. Tapp starts to follow, 
                         just a we bit dazed from the hit. He 
                         empties his gun cartridge and replaces 
                         it, then runs towards the door, screaming.
 
                         
               Back to Lawrence crying on the floor of the bathroom. Hes just 
               a complete wreck, making low moaning sounds. Suddenly, there 
               is a loud buzzing sound his body is jerked up and he is flung 
               onto his back as he is electrocuted. Adams eyes widen and he 
               starts to panic.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Lawrence! (A bit of foamy spittle comes 
                         out of Lawrences mouth as the electrocution 
                         continues, and then a moment later stops. 
                         Adam watches, frightened, unsure. Lawrence 
                         is out.) Lawrence, get up!
 
                                     CUT TO
                         Car Chase! Zep is in the lead, with 
                         Tapp in hot pursuit behind him. They 
                         race through the streets as fast as 
                         they can.
 
               Cut back to the bathroom. Adam looks around him, not sure what 
               to do, panicking. Lawrence cant be dead, he cant be alone in 
               here. He cant handle this alone. He needs his calm, collected 
               Doctor, no matter how badly Lawrence has treated him.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (crying out, close to tears) Lawrence! 
                         Get up! I need you! (He leans down and 
                         finds a piece of debris on the floor, 
                         throws it at Lawrence. It doesnt hit 
                         him. He leans down, picks up another, 
                         throws it. This one bounces onto the 
                         floor but ricochets and hits Lawrence, 
                         who begins to stir. A moment, and Lawrence 
                         starts to move more, reaching for his 
                         head and sitting up. Adam cries out 
                         in relief.) Oh, thank God! I thought 
                         you were dead!
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (sits up, dazed and confused) He...he 
                         electrocuted me...
 
                                     ADAM
                         I told you! The same thing happened 
                         to me, see? I wasnt lying, see?
 
               Lawrence leans over and grabs his chain, the source of the electrocution. 
               Suddenly, he snaps.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (screaming) FUCK THIS SHIT!!

               Back in the bathroom, Lawrence continues to grunt and struggle 
               with his chain. Suddenly the phone rings and he turns. He quickly 
               moves to get it, but it is out of reach. He lays flat on the 
               floor, just a foot away from it, trying desperately to grab it.
 
               
               In the hallway, Tapp enters, keeping his gun aimed out in front 
               of him. He looks down the hallway, sees nothing. Cut to Zep climbing 
               down a ladder into another level, grunting in pain. Tapp hears 
               him and follows the sound down the hall.
 
               In the bathroom, the phone keeps ringing. Lawrence grabs the 
               hinged box, turns it upside down and tries to catch the phone 
               with it. He cannot reach, and starts to cry loudly again. He 
               tosses the box away, crying/screaming as he tries to reach the 
               box with his arms. Adam watches with a terrified look, not knowing 
               what to do.
 
               Zep reaches the bottom of the ladder, leaning against it, moaning 
               from the pain of his leg. He hears Tapp above him, hobbles off 
               further down the hallway. Tapp climbs down the ladder, moving 
               in the same direction as Zep. As Tapp can move faster than Zep, 
               he rounds the corner and catches Zep hobbling down the hallway. 
               Zep turns and sees him, firing a few shots but missing. Tapp 
               ducks behind a large stone column jutting out of the wall. He 
               leans out and fires at Zep. Zep falls back slightly but remains 
               standing. If he got hit, it isnt clear where. Zep then turns 
               and quickly hobbles further down the hall.
 
               Cut back to Lawrence still crying and trying to get the phone 
               as it keeps ringing.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         No!!!! (He lowers his head and cries 
                         loudly.)
 
                                     ADAM
                         (Frightened but trying to stay calm 
                         for Lawrence.) Lawrence, calm down. 
                         There must be a way out of this! (It 
                         seems to be a complete role reversal 
                         for the two of them from the beginning, 
                         where Adam was the one freaking out 
                         and Lawrence was calm. Here, Adam is 
                         terrified but still calmer than Lawrence, 
                         who has just lost it.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (screaming) I cant be calm! My family 
                         needs me! No, God! (He cries and screams, 
                         still cant get the phone. He quickly 
                         turns and sits up, grabbing the chain 
                         and pulling it as he lets out a terrible 
                         scream of rage. Adams hands are up 
                         clutching his head, trying to keep his 
                         cool but having a very hard time.)
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (Loudly trying to speak over Lawrences 
                         continued loud, primal screams.) Lawrence, 
                         I have a family too! I dont see them, 
                         thats my mistake. Its a mistake Id 
                         like to fix!
 
               Cut to Zep hobbling down the hall. Tapp is there running after 
               him. Zep turns a corner, and Tapp runs to try to keep up.
 
                                     TAPP
                         Im gonna kill you you sick asshole!
 
                         
               Back in the bathroom, Lawrence continues to freak out as he mentally 
               breaks down, clutching the chain and screaming more.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (desperate, losing his attempted calm 
                         stance) Lawrence, stop it!
 
               Lawrence sits up, stops pulling at his chain but continues screaming. 
               He starts to unbutton his blue button-down shirt. That is too 
               slow, however, so he starts to rip it open.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (sobs in his voice) Lawrence, please 
                         calm down! Theres a way out of here, 
                         theres a way out!
 
               Lawrence gets his shirt off, down to a plain white tee shirt 
               underneath. He starts to wrap one end around his manacled foot 
               and ties it off. Adam realizes what he is preparing to do, completely 
               loses it and freaks out, screaming.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Lawrence! No! Oh my God! What are you 
                         doing?!
 
               Lawrence holds the other end of the shirt in his mouth, biting 
               it for a brace. The look in his eyes is one of complete madness 
               and desperation. He takes up the hacksaw in his right hand, puts 
               it against his ankle and starts to saw into his foot while Adam 
               begins to scream in complete horror. Lawrence screams through 
               the cloth between his teeth. The blood squirts up onto Lawrences 
               shirt and neck. Adam collapses to the floor in his corner, screaming 
               and wincing.
 
               Back to Zep rounding another corner in the hallway. He moves 
               into an old break room and Tapp runs in after him, finally catching 
               up. Tapp tackles him, tripping him backwards and causing Zep 
               to hit his head against and old mini-refrigerator. Tapp grabs 
               him and brings him up, throwing him hard against the stone wall. 
               Zep falls down to his side. Tapp grabs him up and throws him 
               forward against a cage wall.
 
               Back to Lawrence, still sawing away, blood on his face, neck 
               and shirt.
 
               Back to Tapp pummeling Zep from behind in the back. A look of 
               twisted glee is upon Tapps face as he hits Zep. Zep falls to 
               the floor, gun beside him. He looks like he just wants to curl 
               up and die. Tapp goes down for the gun but Zep reacts, grabbing 
               it. Tapp grabs his hand, and Zep pushes himself up into a standing 
               position, the wall in front of him, Tapp pushing up behind him, 
               trying to take the gun.
 
               Back in the bathroom, Adam is on his hands and knees, screaming 
               and crying as he begs Lawrence to stop. Lawrence does stop, sits 
               up and tosses the saw of to the side. Adam collapses forward 
               a bit.
 
               Back to Zep and Tapp, who continue struggling from the gun. Zep 
               squeezes his way down, groaning as he suddenly drops down between 
               Tapp and the wall, his gun aimed up at Tapp. He pulls the trigger 
               and the shot hits Tapp in the chest, a loud surprise to the former 
               detective.
 
               Back in the bathroom, Lawrence crawls along the floor, moaning. 
               He finds and picks up the single bullet from his envelope, looks 
               at it. Adam watches him in terror.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (screaming/crying) What are you doing?! 
                         (Lawrence crawls on farther, towards 
                         the body.)
 
               Cut back to a close up of the bloody hole in Tapps chest. Tapp 
               remains standing a moment, in shock, gasping, then falls down 
               backwards onto the floor. Zep is still on his knees, holding 
               the gun up at a diagonal. Tapps eyes flutter, then finally close. 
               Zep turns and gets up, limping in pain out of the room and down 
               another hall.
 
               Back in the bathroom, Lawrence reaches the body. He takes the 
               gun, opens the chamber.
 
                                     ADAM
                         What are you...(He suddenly realizes 
                         Lawrences intentions. His eyes go wide, 
                         and he starts to cry out and beg.)
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         Oh my God! Oh my God! Lawrence dont! 
                         (Lawrence puts the bullet in, then closes 
                         the chamber) No! Lawrence, please, Im 
                         begging you! (Lawrence aims the gun 
                         at Adam) Lawrence, its not me who did 
                         this to you!
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (looking like Death, his voice hoarse) 
                         You have to die.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (His hands up in front of him defensively, 
                         moving side to side to try to throw 
                         off Lawrences aim) No, I want to live!
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (moving the gun along with Adams movements) 
                         Im sorry...
 
                                     ADAM
                         I want to live!

                                     LAWRENCE
                         My family...(he aims and pulls the trigger, 
                         hitting Adam in the upper chest area. 
                         Adam falls down forward onto the floor, 
                         his screams stop.)
 
               Lawrence collapses, sobbing. Then he sits up a bit, turning to 
               the surveillance camera and screaming.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Ive done it! Now show them to me! (he 
                         continues to cry, dropping the gun next 
                         to him, collapsing back down with his 
                         forehead to the floor.)
 
               Cut to the Gordons neighbors living room. Alison paces back 
               and forth, holding a cell phone to her ear. Two neighbors sit 
               off to the side on a couch with Diana.
 
                                     NEIGHBOR
                         (OS, on phone) Thank you very much, 
                         Officer.
 
                                     ALISON
                         (on cell phone) Larry?

                                     NEIGHBOR
                         (hanging up the phone and going over 
                         to Alison) Did you get through to him?
 
                         
                                     ALISON
                         Theres still no answer.

                                     NEIGHBOR
                         (reassuringly) Its all right. Ive 
                         called the police. Everythings okay.
 
                         
               Alison goes and sits on the couch. Diana comes up to her, and 
               Alison embraces her daughter.
 
               Cut back to the bathroom, with a shot of the sliding door. The 
               sound of a lock being undone and a bang is heard. Lawrence pushes 
               himself up into a kneeling position, a look of shock on his face. 
               The door slides open and there stands Zep, green mist behind 
               him in the hallway. Lawrence turns and sees him. Zeps eyes dart 
               around the room, seeming to say What the fuck happened in here? 
               He sees Lawrence on the floor, and an eager look comes into his 
               eyes. He walks in, and Lawrence starts to yell at him.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         You bastard! Ill fucking kill you! 
                         (Lawrence grabs Zeps leg as he passes 
                         but is too weak and Zep pulls away, 
                         looking down at him, moving over to 
                         the other side of the body) Ill fucking 
                         kill you! You fucking bastard! (Lawrence 
                         quickly cralws forwarrd and takes up 
                         the gun, pulling the trigger several 
                         times, but there are no more bullets. 
                         It just clicks.) Ill fucking kill you! 
                         You fucking bastard! Ill fucking kill 
                         you! Ill fucking kill you!
 
               Zep goes over to Adam, pushing his side with his foot a couple 
               of times, but to no reaction. He then looks to Lawrence and aims 
               his gun at him, shaking his head.
 
                                     ZEP
                         Youre too late.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (weakly) Why?

                                     ZEP
                         Its the rules.

               Zep is about to pull the trigger when suddenly Adam comes to 
               and grabs his ankle, pulling him down. The back of Zeps head 
               hits the floor hard. Adam pulls him towards him, struggles to 
               get the gun from Zeps hand, screaming. The gun goes off once 
               off to the side. Adam moves Zeps arm back and forth, and it 
               goes off again. Finally, Adam slams Zeps arm down and gets the 
               gun away from him, tossing it away. He slugs Zep hard across 
               the face, stunning him. Lawrence starts crawling towards them. 
               Screaming like a madman, Adam sits up and grabs the toilet seat 
               lid from the toilet, and slams it down onto Zeps head as hard 
               as he can. He repeats this seven times before the lid snaps in 
               half. Lawrence reaches the two and reaches up for Adams arm 
               as Adam brings the broken lid down again. Lawrence grabs his 
               arm and Adam drops the lid, falling forward a bit and clutching 
               his shoulder wound with his free hand, crying hard. Lawrence 
               moves in, touching his head to Adams.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (his voice very weak and shaky) Youre 
                         going to be all right. (Adam stops sobbing 
                         for a moment) Youre just wounded in 
                         the shoulder. I have to go and get help.
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (grasping Lawrences shirt, begging.) 
                         Dont leave me! No!
 
               Lawrence nods, pulling away from him and starts to crawl off. 
               Adam reaches for him as he turns himself around and away.
 
                                     ADAM
                         No!! (he keeps crying) No! No! (Lawrence 
                         crawls towards the door.) Lawrence! 
                         Lawrence!
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (he pauses, turns to look back at Adam) 
                         Dont...Dont worry, Ill bring someone 
                         back, I promise. (He continues crawling 
                         on, out the door while Adam watches 
                         him pathetically, still crying and reaching 
                         out for him.)
 
               Lawrence makes it out the door, and starts dragging himself down 
               the hall. Adam is now alone in the room with two corpses. Adam 
               looks to the door one more time then turns to Zeps body. He 
               pulls himself on top of him, wincing at his shoulder pain.
 
               
                                     ADAM
                         (thinking) Key...key...

               He starts going through Zeps pockets, patting him down. He finds 
               Zeps wallet, opens it and feels through it; there s nothing 
               of value to him right now. He tosses it down. He continues feeling 
               for something, suddenly feels something in Zerps coat pocket. 
               His eyes widen as he reaches in, wincing from the pain in his 
               shoulder. He pulls out a tape recorder. He stares at it, his 
               eyes and mouth starting to widen. He glances down at Zep, then 
               at the tape recorder. Sitting up a bit more, he presses play. 
               It is Jigsaws voice.
 
                                     JIGSAW
                         (VO) Hello Mr. Hindle. Or as they called 
                         you around the hospital: (shot of Zep 
                         in the hospital with his cleaning cart, 
                         stopping at Johns room) Zep. I want 
                         you to make a choice. (Shot of the closet 
                         doors in Dianas room flying open, Diana 
                         screaming, Alison coming in and seeing

                         and gagging Alison and Diana. Shot of 
                         the photo of Diana and Alison tied and 
                         gagged.) Theres a slow-acting poison 
                         coursing through your system (shot of 
                         Zep watching the monitor, holding his 
                         hand to his mouth. He actually looks 
                         rather ill) which only I have the antidote 
                         for. Will you murder and mother and 
                         her child (Zep rocking aback and forth, 
                         getting ready to kill Alison and Diana) 
                         to save yourself? (Shot of Zep next 
                         to Alison, saying Dr. Gordons time 
                         is up; holds the phone to her ear. Shot 
                         of Zep in the living room, screaming 
                         Mrs. Gordon! Shot of Zep on the floor 
                         firing up at Tapp.) Listen carefully, 
                         if you will. There are rules. (Lawrence 
                         on the floor looking up at Zep, asks 
                         Why? to which Zep says Its the rules.)

               Zeps voiceover of Hes a very interesting person, with a shot 
               of John in his hospital bed with Dr. Gordon and the med students. 
               His name is John. Shot of Lawrence pointing at the chart, He 
               has an inoperable frontal lobe tumor. Close up shot of John in 
               his bed, eyes flickering open slightly.
 
               Shot of Tapp in the workshop, holding a gun to Johns head. Sick

               at Pauls cage, shot of the jigsaw puzzle piece wound on Paul,

                         their blessings. Shot of Lawrence with 
                         Diana, checking his beeper, on his computer 
                         ignoring Diana and Alison, trying to

               Frontal shot of John in his robe in the workshop with the detectives,

               a front row seat to his own sick little games, with overlapping

                         (VO) Hello Mark, Paul, Amanda, Zep, 
                         Adam, Dr. Gordon. (As he says each name, 
                         the following image of them appears: 
                         A shot of Mark screaming with the safe, 
                         Paul in his cage while still alive, 
                         Amanda in her mask in the chair, Zep 
                         watching on the monitor, Adam holding 
                         the tape recorder to his ear, Lawrence 
                         holding the tape recorder to his ear. 
                         Then, a shot of the Puppet on the video 
                         as he says) I want to play a game.
 
                         
               Back to the shot of Adam staring at him, shocked. Suddenly, Adam 
               looks down, grabs Zeps gun and aims for John. But before he 
               can pull the trigger John holds out the remote for the electricity 
               and starts to electrocute Adam, who starts jerking around and 
               drops the gun. As he spasms, a very, very fast montage of images 
               from the entire film from beginning to the end, starting with 
               a shot of Adam being electrocuted after his fake death, then 
               Lawrence, then going back to the beginning, all the way up and 
               ending with Adam stretched out on top of Zep, spasming still 
               from the electrocution. Suddenly the electricity stops and he 
               gasps, raspy loud breathing. John turns away, starts towards 
               the door. Adam can only watch after him.
 
                                     JOHN
                         (VO) Most people are so ungrateful to 
                         be alive. (John turns off the lights 
                         at the door, only the green lighting 
                         from the hallway illuminating him and 
                         then Adam just barely. John moves out 
                         the door, slowly.) But not you. (Adam 
                         reaches out for him and screams. John 
                         turns around and takes the door handle, 
                         starting to slide it shut.) Not anymore.
 
                         
               Adam SCREAMS as loud as he can in terror and despair as John 
               pauses for a moment with the door halfway shut, and says
 
                                     JOHN
                         GAME OVER.

               John slams the door shut the rest of the way, and we are left 
               in darkness with the sound of Adam screaming No! Dont!!! over 
               and over and crying. The screams fade out, and is replaced by 
               the ending titles and instrumental music.

                              In May 1900, Fidel Castro -- in an
                              effort to normalize relations with
                              the Carter Administration -- opened
                              the harbor at Mariel, Cuba with the
                              apparent intention of letting some
                              of his people join their relatives
                              in the United States. Within seventy-
                              two hours, 3,000 U.S. boats were headed
                              for Cuba.   In the next few weeks, it
                              became evident that Castro was forcing
                              the boat owners to carry back with
                              them not only their relatives but the
                              dregs of his jail population. 3y the

                              An estimated 25,000 had criminal

      afternoon light of the little room. Actually it's                                   a
      plywood office somewhere in the processing hall and                                   we hear
      the din from the hall over the question and answer.                                    Two of
      the men sit around a desk, the Third Man stands in                                  a corner,
      staring at Tony, the most authoritative-looking of                                  the
      three.

      eleven year old, mouth hanging open.

                                          BOGART
                                                   What a thing.
                        Conscience.    Conscience.
                        Xf you believe you've got a conscience,
                       'it`ll pester you to death.   But if you
                        don't believe you've got one, what can
                        it do to you? Makes me sick so much
                        talking and fussing about nonsense.
                        Time to go to sleep.

9   INT. TENT - LATER THATNIGHT                                  9
    Tony is moving down 23rd Street, the walk proud and jungle
    in the rock of the hips and the cast of the shoulders --
    now accompanied by his handsome compadre, Manny

                             TONY
             That Bogart, Chico, hunh?

                     That gold dust blowing in the wind.
                     Y'see Manny, he's always looking
                     over his shoulder. Hunh?   Like me....
         He hunches, darting exaggerated looks over his shoulder,
         imitating Bogart. Manny laughs. In his black shirt with
         zig-zag dots and colors and the baggy pants and sunglasses,
         Tony's starting to look American. He's even got himself a
         pop button pinned to his shirt that says "Fuck Off and Die."
         And hi6 English rolls faster off his tongue, his confidence
         more pronounced.

                     thing I never gonna be. I never gonna

        As they chatter, Tony moves on with a movement of the head
        for Manny.  "Later."

        He's in the middle of the "Boulevard" where a bustling black
        market in toiletries, clothing, cigarettes, and transves-
        tites is conducted nightly in the harsh glare of barrack
        neon.

        He ambles past a bunch of young guys throwing a Frisbee,
        past a "Viva Carter!" proclamation in graffiti....

            Tony,     five     minutes        later,        in   a   phone    booth, in    the    middle     of
  ._        a bank of them, dozens of Marielietos pressing to get in,
            trying     still      to        contact    somebody      --    anybody    --   on    the   outside.

            Tony is dialing, his eyes shifting down to the telephone
            number written in pencil on the back of a snapshot-   As he
            finishes the number, he flips the snapshot over and we see
            a young girl, about thirteen years old, dark, tiny, fiery,
            standing together with a dog and Tony, early twenties, in
            shadow, the fringes of the photo heavily tattered with
            handling.   Tony stares at it, his mind drifting as the phone
            rings in a distant place. A brief moment of repose we have
            not yet seen in Tony.
            Someone     picks      up        the     phone. An older woman's Voice.                    His
            expression         alters         to     uncertainty.
                                                            VOICE
                             Yes? ..Hello?..Who                is this?
            Tony changes his mind, hangs up.  Pause. The faces of those
            in line peer in, the next party raps on the door, but Tony
            ignores it, slips the snapshot back into the wallet in his
            pants, then at his own pace, exits the phone booth.
            He walks a few beats, his eyes pensive.                                 Then recognizes
            somebody     in       another          phone     booth   and     goes    over.

            Angel Frenandez has got the face of one, as he argues on
            the phone, then hangs up, a desolate look on his face, a
            worn phone book in his hand.
                                                            TONY

     Tony     winks    and   walks   off.

     The radio is playing hard rock, something like Blondie or
     Benatar from the stoop of a nearby barrack.  Tony loves the
     sound and swings into it, snapping his fingers and rolling
     his hips like Presley. He back-peddles, smiling at Manny
     and Angel.

       Tony waves    her off, then changes his mind and runs up
       behind her    and throws up her skirt and peeks at her ass.
       Before she    can react, he hops away laughing as the two
       Cuban girls    ad-lib Spanish expletives at him.

                 Bey that's not cool, man. You wanna
                 score one of these chicks, watch
                 me. Mira!
       He wiggles his tongue up and down, fast like a small
       whirring motor part, then slips it back into his mouth in
       the flick of an eye.

                                     TONY
                 ...the fuck was #at?

       peeking out of a nest iin his teeth, then it's gone.

                 What the hell's that for -- eating

                 crazy.   They don't resist me.
       Does it again. Tony tries but lacks the speed and agility,
       provoking Manny's laughter. Many double checks himself in a
       shop window.

       Pointing to a tall, cool blonde across the avenue.

       Tony walks right out into the avenue, sticking .out his arm
       and stopping traffic. Cars honk angrily but he couldn't
       give a shit.
                                                  TONY
                       Come     on?
       Manny follows as Tony now moves across the opposite lane, a
       car screeching to a halt in front of him.

                                                  TONY

                       Okay Rober Retfor,               strut your stuff.
       The    blonde    has     paused    to     look    in   a    shop    window.

       Manny stops alongside, pretends to                          look.    When he catches
       her eyes, he flicks his tongue.

       She looks at him, confused, then back into the window.
       Manny look back at Tony, winks, sidles closer to her.

       Tony, waiting off to the side, catches the gaze of a somber
       child, four, toddling along with it's'mom.  Be makes his
       own version of a funny face at the kid who looks back at
       him puzzled. Tony produces another face.   The kid now
       smiles.  The mother looks over.  Tony shrugs.  She smiles
       and moves along.

       Meanwhile,       Manny    has     moved     close      to    the    blonde    and   suggests
       something,    his eyebrows raising, the smile crooked. It
       takes a    moment, then the blonde smacks him across the face
       and walks        away.
       Tony     walks    over     to     him,    mocking.

     intelligence, constantly smoking a cigarette and coughing
     between words, his face pock-marked and pitted like the moon
     from an old acne scars, he cuts a skinny figure at the
     wheel of a big beige Coupe De Ville, idling the motor...with
     him is Waldo Rojas eating a large foot and a half banana.
     In contrast he's amiable, heavyset with a receding hairline,

     Tony, stepping   into the conventionally tasteless orange and
     blue motel room (with heavy blue drapes blocking the
     windows), spreads his hands in a similar posture inducating
     he too is not carrying; but this is only symbolic, it's not
     meant to be a body search.

                         he steps in)
               How you doing amigo...?
     The other person in the room is a tough-looking little dark
     Columbian chick with expressionless eyes, red fingernails,
     and short boy-cut hair, "The Lizard"; she's tinier than the
     Toad, about five-two.
     The Toad looks around the corridor, eases the door closed.

               brothers know everything's okay...
               okay?
      Toad shrugs and readjusts, leaving it open a few inches,
      the conversation clipped and nervous throughout the scene.

     She nods woodenly, stays across the room. Behind her, the

     It's like he's stalling for time. The Lizard has made a
     move somewhere off-center andis now sitting on the bed,
     coiled and always watching.

     There's suddenly a door slamming somewhere outside, then
     commotion.
                                ANGEL

     Tony goes for his cheap handgun when he hears a frightening
      female shriek, like a bird.

                   Don't!    Get up! Now shithead!
       She's standing there with a .32 pointed steady at him, the
       eyes like angry steel. There's no mistaking her ability to
       Shoot.


       The Toad pulls a 9mm out of the small of his back,
       approaches Tony.
       Angel is shoved into the room, followed by two more
       Columbians, "The Kids". They slam the door, both carrying
       Uzis with silencers, neither of them higher than five-four    (Xl
       or older than twenty, with their straight black Indian hair
       cut across their blank eyes, they look like hungry little
       pirranha careless about killing, muttering with the Lizard
       in fast Columbese slang.
       As Toad strips the handgun from Tony:

                                   TONY
                   Frog face, you just fucked up.     You
                   steal from me, you're dead.
       Toad shrugs, he couldn't care less.

                                   TOAD
                   Yeah, okay, you gonna give me the
                   cash or am I gonna kill your brother

                   Try sticking your head up your ass.
                   See if it fits.
       Toad, completing the body search, rips out the stiletto
       taped to the small of Tony's back. As he mutters something
       in hard Columbian slang to the two kids who shove Angel
       into the bathroom, producing strands of thick rope.
       Even more worrisome is the chainsaw that the Lizard now
       pull6 out of the suitcase under the bed.  Toad begin6
       assembling it as Lizard, still covering Tonywith her gun,
       completes the deadpan process by turning up the volume on
       the television set. The news, not 50 ironically in Miami,
       is about a drug-related triple-homicide.

     Angel hangs suspended on the ropes from the top of the
     shower curtain bar, his legs straddling the edge of the
     bathtub.   Toad slaps a tape over his mouth.

     Tony, coverd by the two kids, watches from the lip of the
     bathroom.   He bucks angrily but the two kids ram their
     pistols up against his temple and pin him to the door.
     Angel      looks at Tony; the             eyes          between   them         steady.     They're
     dead     and they know it.

     Toad,   well-prepared, connects                     a     voltage    adapter and
     extension cord.

                       happen to you, you get the money.

     Lizard reenters            the room, shakes her head                      at     the     Toad   who
     nods and turns             on the whirring machine.
     The Toad smiles            amiably       and       angles    the chainsaw              slowly
     towards Angel.
     The two kids press tight against Tony, guns pointed at                                            his
     brains...o.c. we know what's happening as we hear the

     The Toad steps back from the tub, blood splattered on his
     shirt, examjning  his first cut like a butcher. He glances

     Kid   one    slaps         the    tape       across       Tony's        mouth.

     Kid two      reaches        up     to       tighten       the     overhead          strap       to    Tony's

     The Toad turns on his                       chainsaw          when    suddenly           there's       a
     gunshot from the hall.

     and the door smashes open and Manny barrels through and
     shoots a surprised Lizard as she raises her pistol. She
     crashes backwards into the room, wounded.  Everything
     happens very fast now.
     Manny is        at   the lip           of     the bathroom,             he    fires       and    hits      kid
     one, who        is   turning,          in     the neck.

     Tony, not tied up yet, spins on kid two and smashes the
     unloosened strap across his face, sending him reeling
     across   the bathroom.
     The      Toad, chainsaw           in       hand,        slashes      at      Manny.

     Manny     fires      a     burst       into      him      and     the        Toad    crashes         backwards.
     Manny     now      spins    into       a    wall,       hit     in    the      side.

     The Lizard, wounded on her knees, is firing her .32 at
     him.   In b-g., the window simultaneously blows out as
     Chi-Chi appears firing a burst with his Ingram.
      In sharp f-g., the                 Lizard         crumples          forward        on    her        knees,
      foaming blood.

      Tony, with the tape still stuck across his mouth, smashes
      kid two, pinned against the blood-stained sink, with the
      stock of his own Ingram.

      In the midst of this, the Toad jumps up, wounded but with
                  strength, he tears out the motel room door
      hysterical
      gripping the whirring chainsaw in a reflex action.

     Chi-Chi     climbing         through     the        window     fires    at        him.

     Meanwhile, kid two, with a rattlesnake life in him, produces
     a knife out of nowhere, just missing Tony's gut by a half-
     second as Tony dances back, getting a grip on the machine
     pistol.

     He blows kid two away point-blank, putting another ten
     craters in the mirror of the now-wrecked motel room.

     Tony,     yelling, whirls              after     the    Toad.

                                                    TONY
                       I   got him!

     Manny, holding his side, empties                         his    pistol       on     kid      one     who
     is still twitching.
     Chi-Chi     sees       Angel,         gags.

     The senior citizens, playing Mah-Jorigg on the porch, mutter
     in astonishment.
     As the Toad staggers out into the parking lot,                                         blood       flying,
     chainsaw in hand, moving like a jerky chicken.

     Their      eyes       follow.

     As Tony comes out, walking after him deliberately, eyes set
     in cold fury, machine gun swinging loosely at his side.
     There's no rush, no fear of the police, getting even is all
     that counts.  He stands behind the Toad.

     The     Toad   whips         around     to    the     voice, eyes          stark       with        terror.
     Tony      empties      the     clip     into    the     Toad,       blowing       hiin      apart.
     The bystanders just                   stare, stunned           by    the      ferocity.            Then
     an old lady faints.
     The Toad's body lying awkwardly arched in the gutter, Tony
     turns and with a passing disinterested glimpse at his
     audience, calmly walks back into the motel; the distance
     and the light sufficient to conceal Tony's possible identi-
     fication.

     the    Lizard pulled the chainsaw. The TV news still plays in

     rugs and mosaicked with inexpensive, Aztec-type tiles, the
     impression clean, cluttered, Catholic, somewhat depressing.

     Stepping forward to the center of the living room like a
     cautious cat is his ninteen-year-old sister Gina.  Their

     Moving towards her, he opens the package and pulls out an
     exquisite peral   necklace.  She stares at it, doesn't take
     it.   Gina comes over, takes it for her.

                         I'm working part-time at a beauty
                         parlor.    I'm doing hair.  Remember

          Tony   nods.
 GINA                          It's his place. Plus I'm going to
                         junior college -- Miami Dade -- and in
                         two more years I get my cosmetology
                         license and then I'll be making
                         enough....
 TONY                          Yeah, well surprise, all that's over
                         with starting today.  I didn't bring
                         up my kid sister to work in no hair
                         shop....
          Mama looks over at him on the words "bring up" and he
          catches her look.
 TONY                          ...and Mama   don't    have   to   sew   in    no
                         factory.
          He pulls out a bundle of cash, fifties and hundreds, and
          starts peeling them off on the table.  Mama stops working,
          looks.
 TONY                                 (to Mama as
                                he counts)
                         Yeah, your son's made it Mama, he's
                         a success.  I wanted to surprise
                         you.  That's how come I didn't show.
                         my face around before.   I wanted you
                         to see what a good boy I been.

 CUT TO INT. COCAINE LAB - BOLIVIA - DAY 93 Subtitle     appears:

 COCHABAMBA, BOLIVA Alejandro Sosa is a playboy, about six-foot-two, black wavy
hair, athletic body and a Copacabana tan, the clothes, a
casual polo shirt and the latest pants from Calvin Klein.

On his wrist is a flashy gold ID bracelet with "Alex'
written in diamonds and on the other wrist a gold Rolex
with a bezel full of diamonds worth maybe $30,000. His
eyes fizzle with an energy derived not from drugs but the
continual excitement of his toys and his money.
Accompanying him everywhere is the Shadow, a thin, intense
venomous-looking Hispanic man in his thirties, he has the
look of death in an unsmiling face.   He is always in
proximity to his Jefe, usually slightly behind the person
or persons addressing Sosa -- in a sort of garotte
position, his eyes swivelling to stare down the person who
might glance at him. He is a continual source of tension
underplaying the scenes, particularly coming to affect Omar
who is insecure to begin with.

     Sosa is showing Tony and Omar through his coke processing
     lab, past four coal-fired stoves, each with mas,sive  iron
     kettles bubbling with coca paste...across  to a row of ovens
     where the refined coke dries. The chemists and Indians
     working there all acknowledge llel rey de1 rey" as he
     passes, as proud of his factory as a vine grower his
     vineyard.

 SOSA                            so this and my other factory 1 can

                       kilos refined every month   of the
                       year.   Problem is I have no steady
                       market.    Some months I can't get rid
                       of fifty keys, other months I have to
                       do 2 to 300 keys, it's crazy, hunh?
                       Nobody can run a business that way ---

                       demand varies for us too, month to
                       month....
     Sosa looks at him like that's obvious and moves on.   In his
     skinny  suit, with the wet cigarette clamped between his
     nervous fingers, Omar's not quite in his league with Sosa.

     Tow, awed by the scope of it all,               follows   along,   stops    to
     look at a sample of the dried coke.
     The      Shadow     stops,   eyeballs    him.

     Tony eyeballs him back, playing a game with him, then
     samples the coke off his thumb into his nose. Pause.                       His
     expression says I like it.   He moves on.
     The Shadow moves with him.

                       ...Basically what I'm looking for is

     of his knife and fork as the servants move to and fro, con-

         assumption of power -- whereas Sosa chuckles, amused by his
         brashness, starting to be intrigued by this animal.
 SOSA                      What do you suggest is a fair...?
                     Excuse me.
          Interrupted, Sosa looks over at his black aide who suddenly
          appears at the door, apparently with a message.  Sosa waves
          him in.
          The black aide Y- The Skull -- is a slim, tall imposing man
          with academic, 'horn-rimmed glasses and close-cropped hair
          on a huge and impressive skull. He combines the physical
          qualities of an animal with an intellectual. As he
          approaches, he glances down the table, his eyes falling

     just for a moment -- then continues towards Sosa with the
     same stony, loyal expression.
     Sosa lends his ear and the Skull whispers his information.
     A beat. He whispers a second thought. Sosa reacts minimally.
     Then he nods, dismissing the Skull who heads out the room.
     Sosa glances at his gold Rolex.

     Tony shrugs.
 SOSA                Where were we?
 TONY                Panama.   You're looking for a partner,
               right?
     Omar shoots a poisonous glance at Tony.
 SOSA                ...something like that.

 OMAR                Look Mr. Sosa, we're getting ahead of
               ourselves here.   I'm down on Frank's
               authority to buy 200 keys, that's it,
               that's my limit.    I got no right to
               negotiate for Frank Lopez on anything
               larger than that. So why don't we...
 TONY                Hey Omar why don't you let the man
               finish, hunh? Let him propose his
               proposition.

 OMAR                Hey Montana, you got no authority here,

                 Omar, who, with one hesitant look, steps inside.
                 The chopper lifts off the lawn, the camera moving to the
                 polo players exercising in the distance...a woman on a
                 horse rides by and we swing with her towards the villa.
                 Sosa walks Tony down an outside gallery towards the veranda
                 where servants lay out the coffee and fruits.

      Tony stops, spots his sister Gina, in an expensive looking
      dress, with a flashy young Cuban guy in a burgundy suit.
 TONY                 What the fuck is she doing here,
                she's....

                Hey c'mon Tony, it's okay, it's just
                a disco for chrissake. What do you
                give her money for if you don't want
                her to go out, have some fun?
      Gina spots Tony, hesitates, waves to him. Manny waves
      back.  Tony nods. Burgundy suit checks them out.
 TONY                 Who's she with?

                     kid, he works for Luco, he's
                Some
                harmless....
      Tony spots a Large Man coming towards him.     Caucasian,
      about 250 pounds.
 TONY                 Keep your eye on her. Make sure he
                don't dance too close.

                Sure Tony.

       There's something ugly in his smile, maybe it's 'cause just

      There are four legs visible in one of the stalls.  Tony
      moves past two men washing up, and hurls himself against
      the door.
      It crashes open on Gina in the act of snorting coke, with
      burgundy suit running his ha&s along her ass.

      The argument has moved across the bathroom to the lip of
      the hallway. Several more people are watching.
 GINA                 You got a nerve, Tony, you got a

      into the toilet.
                             Tony stands there, abated.
      The crowd is silent.
      Manny moves across the floor and kneels down, consoles Gina
      who is sobbing.

      He turns and bulldozes his way through the growing crowd,
      no regrets, but disturbed.
      Manny helps Gina to her feet.

      coupe.  She's still angry.
 GINA                    ...He's got a nerve the way he acts!
                Mama's right. She says he hurts every-
                thing he touches. Well he's not gonna
                hurt me anymore. He`ll never see me
                again. Never!

                  He loves you, what do you want. He
                  feels he raised you.

                  in jail five years and he still thinks
                  I'm fifteen!

                  Hey,    you're the best thing he's got.
                  The    only thing. He don't want you to
                  grow    up to be like him. So he's got

      towards the house, looking at him.
      He watches.
 CUT BACK TO 113 INT. BABYLON CLUB - LATER THAT NIGHT 113       The Owner appears at the mike, the music drifting    to
      Sinatra's "Strangers In The Night'.
 OWNER                   All right, you coneheads, another
                  exciting evening at the Babylon, hunh?             (X)
                  Now I want you to check out this next
                  hombre.  I found him stoned in the
                  jungle and there's nothing you'll
                  ever see like him.  I present with
                  great pride, 'from Caracas, Venezuela
                  -- 'Octavia' !

      Lights dimming to the bluesy rhythm of the Sinatra song as
      sad-eyed Octavia suddenly appears in the shifting spot-
      light drawing immediate laughter.
      He is dressed as an enormously fat old man with a Quasimodo
      mask covering both the front and back of his head and neck.
      With a red bulb for a nose, he gyrates grotesquely to the
      sleek song; once the mood of laughter has been established,
      the music suddenly shifts upbeat to "Saturday Night Fever"
      and the clown, like a butterfly from a worm, starts
      shedding the stuffing from his clothes, his big eyes
      staring out at us in theatrical melancholy.
      Tony watches, sitting alone, distracted by the clown.
      More laughter, more clothes coming off, building a tempo.
      PJ%en the head mask comes off, we see the gaunt handsome
      face of a young clown in white paint with the large
      blackened eyes staring without expression at the laughing
      audience.
      Tony is hooked by the image, looks on.
      The clown is down to his leotards, thin as a stick, and
      pulling the girls out onto the floor to dance with him,
      bouncing around like yo-yos. Everybody is laughing,
      everybody is merry...

            sharpening spotlight in his white face as the act comes to
            its close, a haunting figure of mockery....
            Tony, absorbed by his thoughts, is lucky this time.     His
            antennae warn him.     Out of the side of his eye, he sees....
            The two hitters moving on him.
            He sprawls. Machine gun fire rips through the upholstery,
            smashing the mirrors....
            Screams,    crowd diving for cover....
            Tony, hit in the shoulder, rolls, gets his Baretta out of
            his ankle, firing....
            Hits one of the gunmen in the chest; the man staggers
            across the disco floor firing volleys into the mirrors and
            ceilings....
            Tony moving under the tables, towards the door, firing....
            The second hitter is pinned, firing back, breaking more
            mirrors, and more screaming.
            Tony lets the gunman have another burst then runs out the
            door, his clothes ripped with blood and'glass.
            The clown, Octavia,    lies dead on the silent dance floor.
 CUT TO 114 EXT. THE BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT 114             Tony runs out, crouched, to his red Jaguar.
            Exchanging shots with a third hitter across the parking
            lot, he runs out of ammunition.
            He jumps into the Jaguar, his windows being blown out.
             The second hitter, wounded, running out of the club,
             towards him.
             The third hitter advancing, carhops scattering.
             Tony reaching under his seat, gets a hold of his own Ingram
             machine pistol, cocks it and lays down a field of fire.
             Carhops    scattering, the hitters seeking cover.
             Hitter two, already wounded, is hit again, his head
             exploding like squashed watermelon.

      across the shattered windows.
      He guns the Jaguar out into the lot, bullets careening off
      the armor plating, whining against the shutters.
      Tony suddenly brakes the car and reaches down and slams the
      gear shift into reverse.
      In an instant, his warmobile                        in reverse,
                                           accelerates

      there, but is overtaken and crushed by the car.

                    won the Division tonight. We're
                     going to Sarasota for the State
                    Championship...Hunh!
 MUFFLED VOICE                       Congratulations.     That's .great Frank.
          Tony, Manny and Chi-chi slide into the room, the latter two
          with guns casually drawn.

 123 INT. LOPEZ MOTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT 123 TONY                       Yeah, it sure is Frank.     What'd    you
                      do -- fix the umpire?
          Lopez, his nose in a glass of scotch, almost muffs it right
          there and then, but manages to recover.

 LOPEZ                       Tony...?   Uh, I'll call you
                      back-.-yeah.
          Hangs the phone up and rocks forward at his desk.
          Lopez's bodyguard, Ernie, gets the message from Chi-chi
          sliding along the wall next to him, Manny covering the
          other side of the room.

 LOPEZ                       Tony... what happened to you, hunh?
 TONY                       Yeah, lookit.  They spoiled one of

              Tony,
              shifts his eyes with camera slowly onto Mel Bernstein
              sitting there with a bourbon on the rocks, his two hundred
              and fifty pounds bulging with irritated surprise.

                          back to the 'Sun Ray' thing.
 TONY                           Hey, you might be right.
 LOPEZ                           Anyway I'm glad you made it Tony,
                          we'll return the favor for you. In

              The phone rings.
              Lopez lets the phone ring.

 TONY                           Why don't you answer it 'Frank?

            Tony, angry now, grabs Lopez by the shirt and hauls him
            forward across his desk so his gut lies flat across it.

               left hand pointed at the big man.

                Bernstein takes it in the gut, hits the floor, looks up

       which he has,-- with a sense of humor -- added a large neon
       sign on the front lawn that says:
 THE WORLD IS YOURS

       full glory as a beggar's banquet of gang members and various
       girl friends (but no sign of kids) looks on. Chi-Chi is

             Tony,  accompanied by Marmy, walks a young, thirtyish bank
             president into his office, which is rigged with video
             monitors surveilling all areas of the house and grounds.
             There's an abundance of electronics -- televisions, sound
             systems, computer toys, video games, desk, couch, chairs --
             but not one sign of a book on the walls.
             Jerry, the Banker, is slickly dressed, hair coiffed, the
             eyes scooting shrewdly back and forth, the type of guy who
             follows the Hong Kong money markets on weekends, a guy who
             never stops thinking money.

 TONY                          ...yeah, well, I can't pay that no
                         more Jerry, I'm gonna be bringing in

                         talking ten million a month now.
                         That's serious money.   So I think
                         it's time you bank boys come down

        he has another engagement,

159 EXT. WAREHOUSE - ALONGSIDE MIAMI FREEWAY - DAY       Tony and Nick The Pig get out of a van, frowning in the
      glary sunlight. From the continual sound of jet aircraft
      taking off and landing we might sense we're near an airport.
      As Nick hauls a duffel bag on his back, Tony, carrying a
      suitcase of his own, reads the sign on top of the warehouse:
 "CONSOLIDATED CARRIES INC. 
160 INT. SEIDELBAUM OFFICE - WAREHOUSE - DAY 16       The office is bare and ugly, the furniture naugahyde black.
      There's noise from an outer office, and people on phones,
      moving, talking.
      Tony and Nick sit on a couch stacking twenty dollar bills
      from the duffel bag and suitcase onto a coffee table.
      Two men in casual sports clothing sit opposite them in
      chairs, one of them -- Seidelbaum -- squaring the bills and
      passing them efficiently through a money-counting machine
      which clicks at rhythmic intervals throughout the scene.
      Seidelbaum's a small, fat 7th Avenue-type with a lot of
      rings on his fingers and sharp, porky eyes.
      The other guy -- Luis -- a dark Cuban, is long, lean and
      smooth with aquiline nose and dancing eyes. He drinks
      coffee, smiles a lot and bullshits -- two sordid guys who
      look the part.
      It's a tedious process counting a million five in twenties,
      it takes four/five hours; and throughout the desultory
      dialogue Tony, absorbed by the money, and Nick never stop
      the monotonous work of counting and stacking and noting the
                 At all times all four men, thoroughly aware of
      amounts.
      the large stacks on the table, move and talk gingerly
      although they appear casual and bored. They drink a lot of
      coffee.
 LUIS                    . I . yeah back then I worked in pictures
                                         I was in that picture
                   down in Columbia.

 GOODSON                     How        do    you   do,    Mr. Montana....
      He smells like a government guy.  Sosa summons                             the     black
      aide -- in a hushed voice.
 SOSA                 Nicky, have Albert0 meet us in the

      Tony is shown a chair in the middle of the veranda,
      surrounded on            all sides. There is a strained beat to the
      proceedings.             Ernie and Chi-Chi hang around the edges.
      He suddenly catches a glimpse                      of the sloe-eyed Gabriella
      moving with another woman past                     a window of the house. Then
      she's gone.
      Sosa pulls         up     a     chair   right     opposite      Tony,   almost    touching
      knees.
 SOSA                        Tony, I want to discuss something

                        problem... I think we can solve both
                        our problems.
           Tony     waits.

 SOSA                          We all know you have tax troubles in
                         your country -- and you may have to
                         do a little time. But we have some
                         friends in Washington who tell us
                         these troubles can be taken care of
                            ...maybe you'll have to pay a big

                         there's no      time....

 INTERVIEWER                   I've heard whispers, Doctor Gutierrez,
                  about the financial support your govern-
                  ment receives from the drug industry in
                  Bolivia.

 GUTIERFSZ                   The irony, of course, is that this
                  money -- which is in the billions,
                  J i m - - is coming from your country.
                  You are the major purchaser of our
                  national product -- which of course
                  is cocaine.

 INTERVIEWER                   So what you're saying Doctor Gutierrez
                  is the United States Government is
                  spending millions of dollars to
                  eliminate the flow of drugs into our
                  streets and at the same time is
 - - -                   doing business with the very same
                  government that floods those' streets
                  with cocaine.. -that's a bit like
                  robbing Peter to pay Paul, isn't it?

                                  Rebenga was? Politics or what?
                     Manny    remembers.
 TONY                                   No     free    rides   in this        world,       kid.

                                  So who's this          guy    you     brought back
                                  with you, the          guy    who     don't blink?

 ELVIRA                                   What     guy?
 TONY                                           (to Manny)
                                  You stay out of it. Run things down
                                  here.   1'11 be up in New York next week.
                     He   takes   a     hit,    unnoticed.
 ELVIRA                                              (unheard)
                                  What     guy?

                                         (to Tony)
                                  I don't like it.
 TONY                                   You don't like it!   It was you got
                                  me into this mess in the first place
                                  with that fuckin' Seidelbaum!

                                  What's        Seidelbaum     got     to    do     with    this?
                     Tony sighs, turning his attention to Elvira. He surveys the
                     table with the bored satiety of a Roman Emperor, points to
                     Elvira's untouched plate.
 TONY                                   Why don't you eat your                    food,     what's

          She quickly does one               nostril    with    a      quick,     practiced       move-
          ment of her hand.
 TONY                      So    what'd       you     order it       for?

 ELVIRA                      I     lost    my    appetite.
          She   does the other nostril. Tony looking                         at    her.     One     beat.
          Two   beats. He passes a silent burp.


                             (trying to
                             shift the mood)
                     So what about the trial?  I heard
                     Sheffield thinks he can get a new
                     postponement....
          Tony, bleary-eyed now and drunk, continues                         to     look    at     Elvira,
          then away, encompassing the restaurant.

 TONY                             (ignoring the question)
                     Is this it? Is that what it's all about,
                     Manny?  Eating, drinking, snorting, fucking?
                     Then what? You're fifty and you got a bag
                     for a belly and tits with hair on 'em and
                     your liver's got spots and you're looking
                     like these rich fuckin' mummies in here?
                     Is that what it's all about?


                      It's    not       so    bad    Tony,     could    be      worse....

 TONY                                 (doesn't hear)
                      . . I is that what I worked 'for? With
                      these hands?      Is that what I killed
                      for?     For this?
                                (turns his gaze
                                stonily on Elvira)
                      A junkie??? I gotta fucking junkie for
                      a wife? Who never eats nothing, who
                      wakes up with a quaalude, who sleeps
                      all day with black shades on, who won't
                      fuck me 'cause she's in a coma!


                                   (gently)

      Elvira reacts -- wanting to kill.  She gets up and dumps
      her plate filled with food on him.  Slop drips all over him.

 ELVIRA                      You     sonufabitch!      You fuck!
      They got a black tie audience now. The waiter tipping
      around to clean up the mess.  Tony slowly wiping the food
      off   himself.

 ELVIRA                      How dare you talk to me like that!
                     You call yourself a man! What makes
                     you so much better than me, what do
                     you do? Deal drugs? Kill people?
                     Oh that's just wonderful Tony -- a
                     real contribution to human history.
                     You want a kid. What kind of father
                     do you think you'd make, Tony? What
                     kind of stories are you going to
                     tell the kid before he goes to sleep
                     at night? You going to drive him to
                     school in the mornings, Tony? You
                     really think you're still going to
                     be alive by the time he goes to
                      school, Tony? You're dreaming, Tony,
                     you're dreaming!
      The       audience    is hushed, involved, the camera moving over
      the      faces of     Vie and his rich friends.

       Tony     acidly      quiet, looks     around   at   the   people,   back   to   her.

 TONY                       Sit    down   before   I kill    you.

 ELVXRA                       * . . You think of yourself as a husband,
                      too, Tony.     But did you ever stay
                      home without having six of your goons
                      around all the time? I have Nick the
                      Pig as a friend? What kind of life
                      is that Tony? What kind of life is

           Silence.  Tony's fury has passed.  So has Elvira's.  There's
           this awkwardness all of a sudden like two actors who forgot
           their lines.

 TONY                               (softly)
                       Go on, get a cab home,                you're    stoned.

            Pause.    She starts wobbling out. Past the silent
            spectators, their eyes moving between her and Tony.

            Manny   rises     to     follow.

      food, the silence cathedral.   He stands, wiping at the food
      and throwing several hundred dollar bills on the table,
      then looks up angrily at the staring millionaires.

 TONY                       You're all assholes. You know why?
                      'Cause none of you got the guts to be

      He wobbles        against   the   table.    Manny   tries     to    help.    Tony
      shakes him        loose.

 TONY                       You need people like me so you can
                      point your fingers and say 'hey

      He     starts     out,   staggers.

 TONY                       So say good night to the bad guy...
                      You're never gonna see a bad guy
                      like me again.

      He walks out, proud, Manny bringing up the rear. The room
      is empty for a beat -- an extended beat, the stage without
      its star -- and then the audience begins to buzz with horror
      and delight.

 CUT TO 174   EXT. GUITERREZ' STREET - NEW YORK - NIGHT                                                f-74
      A quiet East Eighties street. Two rich-looking male lovers
      stroll past with their dog. A moment of silence. Tony
      moves into frame.
      Behind him, the Shadow (Alberto) moves towards a sedan
      parked along the curb, carrying an airline bag. Be slips
      under the car.

      Tony     looks:

, 176 CHI-CHI 176 --d--         waits    in   Tony's   sedan   double-parked   down   the   block.

              Tony,    feeling everything's okay, does .a nervous, quick
              snort,    paces next to the vehicle the Shadow disappeared
              under.
              Ground level -- the Shadow, using a pen flashlight, removes
              the bomb from the bag. With subtly inexorable music, the
              camera frames and moves on the bomb -- wired, soldered,
              taped -- a malignant centipede in the long agile fingers of
              the Shadow, who delicately presses a tester. A glass
              button on the bomb now flashes red at soothing intervals as
              the Shadow winds a roll of black tape from the bomb to an
              axle of the car.

 TONY 178 170 
                sees     it.

                A cop car comes cruising off the avenue up the street,
                towards us,
                Ground level -- the Shadow continues to wind his black tape
                trying to secure the bomb as tight as possible.
                Tony     hurries     to     the    car,    bends   down.

 TONY                                              (Spanish)

                The      Shadow     douses    it     and    freezes     in     position.

                Tony looks up just as the cop car pulls alongside, the
                passenger cop, a female, noticing him, saying something to
 .                 her partner who eases the car to a halt.

                Tony      hurries     out     into    the     street,        taking     the     initiative.

              a near collision with an insane bus driver and has to brake
              suddenly, angling into a deep pothole, shaking the car and
              honking angrily after the bus.

              The Shadow goes nuts, peering                    over      the    dashboard     to     see   if
              the bomb came loose.

       She looks UP, insanely, at Tony, her eyes huge with
       disbelief.

 GINA                      You     killed       him?
       Shaking     her     head     at    him    incredulously.

 GINA                      We got married just yesterday. We
                     were gonna surprise you.

       Tony stands there, doubly                 stunned   by     the     news.

 GINA                      Manolo, oh Manolo, what'd                  he     do?..
                     What'd he do?
       She hugs his corpse tightly to her                        breast and       makes
       horrible strangled sounds with her                        throat.

                                                                      somebody's seen the
       Chi-Chi hurrying up to Tony, worried
       shooting.   Ernie follows.

 CHI-CHI                                   come    on.    We gotta       get    out   of
                     Tony,
                     here.
                                   (to Gina)
                     Come     on     baby...Gina!

        Suddenly    she     goes      berserk.

 GINA                      Noooooooooooo!
        And shoving Chi-Chi aside, launches herself on Tony,
        screaming incoherently like a madwoman, trying to kill
        him.   She beats him around the head, the chest, scratches
        furrows of flesh from his face. He stands there, oblivious,
        numbed.

        Chi-Chi and Ernie have a demon on their hands.  They manage
      . at last to yank her off Tony, kicking and continuing to
        scream.

               Chi-Chi and Ernie, desperate now, drag her forcefully along
               the pavement into the Corniche.  She continues to scream.

 ERNIE                                            (to  Chi-Chi)

               Tony,     back     at    the       door,     looks     down     again.
               The     eyes     of      Manolo       staring        sightlessly.

               Chi-Chi       runs      back,        grabs     Tony.

 CHI-MI                                 Tony!

               Pulls     him.        Tony     snaps     out    of     it.

 TONY                                 Yeah!

               He    goes.      Chi-Chi        lifting         Nanny's       body,    hauling      it.
               Tony getting into the Corniche, Ernie pinning Gina against
               the front seat. Chi-Chi propping MaMy into the driver's
               seat with him. The car roars away.
               The camera closing on Gina as she looks through the glass

               Tony, scratchesacross his face, strides through the front
               door into the marble foyer. Another Marielito is waiting               (X
               for them at the door.

               Ernie and Chi-Chi are almost carrying Gina, who is numb
               with shock.

                              Put her in my bedroom.

               She looks up at him through her stupor and spits in his
               face.  Chi-Chi and Ernie pull her away -- as Tony stares,              (Xl
                                    They trundle her up the stairs. Tony

                'bag of coke and spreads the entire pound out across the
                black marble coffee table.

                Tony pays       no   attention, Ernie and Chi-Chi noticing the pile   (Xl
                of coke.
                Flashing his silver tooter, Tony snorts a truly giant
                amount in a large pendular swing of his elbow across the
                length of coffee table.

              Tony looks        up at him, focuses.                    The      eyes     are      uncompromising.
              Ernie, a          little     scared     of        him   now,    turns    away.        Chi-Chi          (X)

              A     monsoon-like         wind     blows     through       the      trees     on     the    estate.

              The     monkeys      listen        quietly.
              The     f    lamingoes       flutter.
              . . . Then there's a burst of loud music from the stereo
              speakers on the balcony -- a Billy Joel song, something
              smooth and easy about the high times and how fast they
              go...

                                 see Tony, in long shot, throw open the terrace
              . . . and we
              doors and          stagger out onto the balcony, overlooking his
              estate.
              ...On a closer angle, we track him to the edge of the
              balustrade.   He's done so much coke now he's practically
               catatonic; staggering and muttering to himself.

              His point of view -- panning his estate. The dark emptiness
                                  The wind rustling the treetops. Tony
              echoes back at him.

                    What the hell happened to us?...
      In far b-g. now, behind Tony, on the video monitors
      in his office we see:
      The main gate and guard shack -- a Marielito crosses into                       (X
      view, checks the gate, turns.  Suddenly two figures spring
      out at him. One of them garrotting the Marielito. He
      struggles.

      the interior of the guard shack. They knife the other
      Marielito
      A    third   monitor.    carries     another   image   of    shadows   moving
      through the trees on the estate.
      On the balcony, Tony is oblivious to it all, spent, almost
      incoherent.
 TONY                     ...I said to you, Manny, I said I
                    never go crazy and you said, I would

      As  Tony turns and starts back through the terrace doors
      into his study, the camera glides around to a view of a
      hook flying up and catching the balustrade.                     A shadow

               Tony     sees   her.

               She steps         forward, offering her body almost naked to her
               brother.

 GINA                                Is     this    what       you want      Tony?...
               Tony     shocked.

 GINA                                You can't stand another man                         touching

                               Well here I am 0-T
               She    fires    the    Baretta       we    now   see    in    her    hand.

               The bullet grazes Tony in the leg, snapping him from his
               catatonia   as he goes reeling across the floor behind his
               desk.    She fires again.  Again.

 GINA                                I'm all        yours       Tony,       I'm all yours
                               now.
               Bullets ripping into the desk.   She advances, offering
               her sex, methodically shooting out the clip at rhythmic
               intervals.

 GINA                                Come and get me Tony.                   Before       it's
                               too     late.

               He spins across the run away from the desk, trying to put
               distance between them.  She sees him scurrying,. turns, an
               expression like a demented angel.

               Advancing on him, firing. The furniture tearing up, the chair
               spilling, television sets and computer toys shattering, Tony
               squirming away, hit again in the thigh, shocked, scrambling
               over to the terrace windows.   Her next shot shatters the
               window and as Tony ducks again to the side, we see outside

      A young Columbian punk no more than twenty -- one of the
      hitters -- is crouched there, reacting to the broken window.
      He  doesn't hesitate, turning his machine gun on Gina.

      Gina is torn to pieces by the firepower -- blown across the
      room, spine severed and dead before she hits the floor.

      Tony sees it, yells something, in the same instant
      swivels to knock the barrel of the machine gun aside.
      The punk is taken by surprise, not having seen Tony, and
      Tony now runs him backwards across the balcony and hurls
      him over the balustrade.

      The punk lands in one of the shallow pools on the grounds
      at the base of the balcony.
      Tony, from above, grabs up the punk's machine gun and
      empties the whole clip into the figure thrashing in the
      pool below.

      Ernie runs into view on the far side of the pool, spots                  (X
               yells    up     ---
      Tony,

                   Tony,         they're    everywhere!
                   here!
      Ernie suddenly wheels, hit in the face, by a burst of                    (X
      silencer bullets.
      We catch a brief glimpse of Sosa's black aide, the Skull,
      moving quickly along the wall of the house -- directly
      underneath the balcony on which Tony stands.

      Tony, tossing the empty machine gun aside, wildly runs back
      into his office to get more guns, crosses to Gina corpse.
      It takes him by surprise. He comes to a dead stop, kneels,
      looking questioningly in her face.

 TONY                                    (gently)
                       Hey     Gina come on, you still angry at
                       me?      I didn't mean to kill Manny, I
                       was..    .I   was.


      Running his hands along her face, trying to rouse her,
      gently lifting her eyelids.  Blood's running out of her
      mouth in rivers.

                Come on open your eyes my baby,
                open your eyes.. -give me a smile.
      There's been a steady pounding and calling now on the door     (X:
      of the office. Tony finally hears it, looks up, then over
      at the monitors.
      One of them reveals Chi-Chi standing there outside the door
      pounding it.
 CHI-CHI                 Boss !    Hey boss.     Open up!
      On the monitor we see Chi-Chi suddenly spin and open fire
      down into the foyer. Return fire decimates him. A grenade
      goes off, blows him up against the door.
 TONY                 Cheeee!
      He now seems to come out of his catatonia, runs to his
      sideboard, hauls out a rocket shoulder-fired rocket
      launcher and straps an Uzi across his shoulder. He looks
      up at the monitor.
      On the monitors, the hitters are now darting across the
      foyer and coming up the left and right hand stairs.
      Three of them are already huddled outside the door, around
      the corpse of Chi-Chi, motioning to-each other, laying a
      grenade at the base of the door to blow it out.
      Tony loading his rocket, ihtends to beat them to the punch,
      talking to himself.
 TONY                  So you wanna play hunh, say hello                    (XI
                 to my little friend here.

      The rocket tears down the door and blows the Columbian
                                             It sounds like
      punks off the landing into the foyer.
      Armageddon, one of the hitters screaming, smoke billowing
      wildly.
      Tony, at the height of his mad glory, steps out at the apex
      of the stairs, firing his machine gun and yelling.

Behind him we see the remainder of the pound of cocaine go up in a burst of wind, whipping around the office in auras of white.

       BEGIN.

       MOM, BEVERLY, a trim, fortyish, pretty Betty Crocker
       of the 90's, grabs the toast as it pops up and
       butters it. She waves cheerfully out the kitchen
       window to the passing GARBAGEMEN on the back of a
       Baltimore County garbage truck and then turns to her
       husband and children and expertly begins to serve
       breakfast.

       DAD, EUGENE, the ultimate nice guy and a dentist by
       trade, divides the morning paper up between himself
       and son CHIP, a cute semi-hip kid who is still in
       high-school.  Daughter, MISTY, a pretty and slightly
       overweight college student, frantically prices the
       junk she plans on selling at the flea market after
       classes while gulping down a light breakfast.

                            MOM
                  Who wants fruit salad?

                            MISTY
                  I do, please.

                            MOM
                       (Hesitating)
                  That's not gum in your mouth,
                  is it?

                            MISTY
                       (Removing it)
                  It's sugarless.

                            MOM
                       (Gently)
                  You know how I hate gum,
                  Misty.  All that chomping
                  and cheesing...
                       (Begins serving her)

                            MISTY
                  Sorry, Mom.  Thanks.
                   (To her brother, as she
                    prices a record album)
                  Hey, Chip, think I could get
                  50c for Vanilla Ice.

                            CHIP
                  I wouldn't give ya a nickle.

                  Carl can't believe how much I
                  make at swap meets.

                  (Rolling her eyes good-naturedly)
                  And who may I ask is Carl?

                            MISTY
                  Just a boy.  He's picking me up
                  this morning.

                            CHIP
                  Here we go again.

                            MISTY
                  He's really cute!

                  Cute is not enough, Misty.
                  You know that.

                            CHIP
                  She sure can pick 'em!

                  He goes to college with me!

                            DAD
                  Leave her alone, Chip.
                       (To MOM)
                  I think it's great she has a
                  new beau, Beverly.

       MOM smiles kindly, picks up a box of cereal in each
       hand and turns to the family.

                            MOM
                  Cereal anybody?

       Title "SERIAL MOM" appears on the screen.

                            DAD
                  Just a little, please.  Bad
                  for the teeth.

                            CHIP
                  Always the dentist.

                            MOM
                  Chip, honey?

                            CHIP
                  Thanks, Mom.

       As MOM serves the cereal, she spots a lone fly as it
       lands on the butter dish.  Without letting on to her
       family, she grabs a flyswatter and begins stalking
       the fly with a terrifying intensity, its buzzing
       enough to make MOM's head explode.

                            DAD
                       (Reading paper)
                  Look at this!

                  college degree in prison!"

                  (Preoccupied, stalking fly)
                  That's nice.

                            DAD
                  Nice?!  He should have been
                  executed!

                            MISTY
                  He killed people, Mom.

                            MOM
                       (To herself)
                  We all have bad nights.
                  (Gets ready to swat, but fly
                   buzzes off)

                            CHIP
                       (To MISTY)
                  You'd probably date him!
                       (Mimicking her)
                  He's cu-uuute!  Hey, Dad, did
                  you ever see "Henry, Portrait of
                  a Serial Killer?"

                            DAD
                  I certainly did not.

                            MISTY
                  You've been working in that
                  video shop too long.

                            DAD
                  And all that gore better hadn't be
                  interfering with your schoolwork.

       MOM stalks fly as it lands on CHIP's toast as the
       rest of the family remains oblivious to MOM's
       building anger.

                            CHIP
                  I do great in school, Dad.
                  (Eats toast as fly buzzes off)

       A sickened and rage-filled MOM stalks the fly to
       DAD's orange juice glass where it secretes on the
       rim in closeup.

                  Well, your mother's going to PTA
                  today.  We'll see what your
                  teacher has to say.

                   the buzzing of the fly builds in

                   the words in a rage)
                  Don't say the word "hate", honey.
                  "Hate" is a very serious word!

       MOM swats violently and we see fly splat in bloody
       closeup. ("Directed by John Waters" credit appears).

       Family is suddenly silent as they uneasily look up
       in surprise at MOM's ferocious attack.

       MOM quickly wipes up squashed fly and smiles back at
       her family.

                  we don't allow gum chewing
                  in this house.
                     (Hands him a paper napkin)

                            DET. BRADFORD
                     (Spitting his gum into
                      paper napkin)
                  Sorry, ma'am.
                   (To MOM and DAD, taking out
                    an envelope)
                  We're investigating obscene
                  phone calls and mail threats to
                  a certain Mrs. Dottie Hinkle.

                            MOM
                  I know Dottie!

                            DAD
                  She lives right down the street.

                            DET. BRADFORD
                  Could you take a look at this...

                            DET. MOORE
                  ...And tell us of anybody who
                  might be responsible?

                            DET. BRADFORD
                  (As he hands note to MOM and DAD)
                  I should warn you...this note
                  contains LANGUAGE.

       MOM and DAD open note.  In cut-out letters from a
       magazine it reads:  "I'LL GET YOU PUSSY FACE!"

                            MOM
                       (Recoiling)
                  Oh God, really!
                   (Hands it back to cop)
                  This is the limit!

                            CHIP
                  Let me see!

                            DAD
                  Sorry, son.
                       (In disgust)
                  This is a matter for adults.

                            MOM
                  Officers, I've never said the
                  P-word out loud, much less
                  written it down!

                            DAD
                  No woman would!

                            MOM
                    (Seeing cute little bird
                     land on window feeder)
                  Look officers!  Life doesn't
                  have to be ugly.
                       (In baby-talk)
                  See the little birdie?  Listen
                  to his call.
                    (Imitating bird call)
                  Peter Pan!  Peter Pan!  Peter Pan!

       CHIP and MISTY roll their eyes in embarrassment as
       bird calls back to MOM.

                            BIRD
                  Peter Pan!  Peter Pan!  Peter Pan!

       DAD smiles proudly as detectives look at MOM in
       amazement.

4.     EXTERIOR SUTPHIN HOUSE.

       A convertible pulls into driveway driven by CHIP's
       best friend, SCOTTY BARNHILL, a handsome but sullen
       red-necky teen.  Next to him is CHIP's girlfriend,
       BIRDIE STUART, a sexy tom-boy with lots of savvy.

       Subtitle appears:  "7:41am" and then fades out.

5.     INTERIOR SUTPHIN KITCHEN.

                            MOM
                  Chip, your ride is here.

                            DAD
                     (Looking at his watch)
                  Hey, I'm late for work.
                  Bye, honey.
                     (Kisses MOM goodbye)

6.     EXTERIOR SUTPHIN HOUSE.

       All exit.

                            DET. MOORE
                  Thanks for your time, everybody.

                            MISTY
                         (Sighing)
                  Bye, Detective Moore.

                            BIRDIE
                   (Leaping out of convertible)
                  Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Sutphin.

                            DAD
                    (To cops, getting into his car)
                  That's Birdie.  She's a horror nut
                  just like my son.

                            MOM
                        (Fondly)
                  Good morning, Birdie.  This is
                  Detectives Moore and Bradford.

                            BIRDIE
                   (Overdramatic, feigning horror)
                  I didn't do it!  I swear!  Don't
                  lock me up!  I'll take a lie detector!
                       (Kisses CHIP)
                       (Good-naturedly to COPS)
                  Hi ya, boys!

                            MOM
                   (Sarcastically to a sullen
                    SCOTTY in car)
                  Good morning Scotty!

       SCOTTY guiltily looks up from vintage Betty Page
       pin-up mag he's reading and toots horn defiantly in
       response as MOM grits her teeth.

                            BIRDIE
                  Hey Misty, look what I got!
                   (Pulling it out of bag)
                  A Pee Wee Herman Doll.  Can you
                  sell it for me at the flea market?

                            MISTY
                       (Impressed)
                  Wow!  Still in the box!  I sure can!
                   (Looks up and sees a Trans Am
                    speeding towards the house)
                  Oh God, here comes Carl!

       DAD pulls off in his car and almost collides with
       CARL as he aggressively manoeuvres his car up the
       driveway.

       CARL PADGETT, a handsome jock climbs out of his car.

                            CARL
                         (To MOM)
                  You must be Mrs. Sutphin.
                  I'm Carl Padgett.

                            MOM
                  Misty's date...

                            CARL
                  More of a friend really...

       MISTY looks hurt.

                            MISTY
                         (To CARL)
                  See what Birdie gave me to
                  sell at the flea market?

                            CARL
                       (Sneering at Pee-Wee)
                  That guy's a weirdo.

       MOM'S smile freezes on her face as CHIP and BIRDIE
       hop in SCOTTY's convertible.

                            MOM
                   (Pointing to SCOTTY and
                    calling out to COPS as they
                    get into their car)
                  Now there's something you should
                  be interested in, detectives.  A
                  grown boy who doesn't wear his
                  seat belts!

       SCOTTY gives MOM a hateful look and peels out.

7.     DISSOLVE TO SUBURBAN STREET.  DET. MOORE and DET.
       BRADFORD sit in their unmarked police car, drinking
       coffee and filling out police reports.

                            DET. BRADFORD
                     (Once again chewing gum)
                  Christ, that one was Beaver
                  Cleaver's mother.
                       (Imitating her)
                  Peter Pan!  Peter Pan!  Peter Pan!

                            DET. MOORE
                       (Good-naturedly)
                  Oh, leave her alone.  Mrs. Sutphin's
                  about as normal and nice a lady
                  we're ever going to find.

8.     INTERIOR BEVERLY AND EUGENE SUTPHIN'S BEDROOM.

       MOM is sitting on bed, dialing phone with a
       determined expression on her face.

       Subtitle appears: "9:37am" and fades out.

       In split screen, DOTTIE HINKLE, the harrassed middle
       aged neighbor, looks at her ringing phone in her
       living room with suspicion and finally answers.

                            DOTTIE
                           (Angrily)
                  Hello.

                            MOM
                       (Speaking in disguised voice)
                  Is this the Cocksucker residence?

                            DOTTIE
                       (Rising to the bait
                         every time)
                  Goddamn you!  STOP CALLING HERE!

                            MOM
                  Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?

                            DOTTIE
                           (Furious)
                  You bitch!

                            MOM
                  Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?

                            DOTTIE
                  The police are tracing your call
                  right this minute.

                            MOM
                  Well, Dottie, how come they're
                  not here then, Fuck-Face?

                            DOTTIE
                       (Red with rage)
                  FUCK YOU!
                       (Slams down phone)

       MOM giggles to herself like a little kid and
       immediately redials the phone.

9.     EXTERIOR SUTPHIN HOUSE.  BACK DOOR.

       ROSEMARY ACKERMAN, MOM's frumpy, brittle, busy-body
       next door neighbor, is knocking on door, carrying a
       sewing basket.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                         (Calling out)
                  Beverly?  Beverly darling?
                  You home?
                    (She lets herself in)
                  I know you are...

10.    INTERIOR MOM'S BEDROOM.

       MOM is laughing to herself listening to ringing
       phone while MRS. HINKLE, on split-screen, tries not
       to answer.  Finally she lunges for it.

                            DOTTIE
                       (Answering)
                  FUCK YOU TOO, YOU ROTTEN WHORE!!

                            MOM
                    (Disguising her voice
                       in prim manner)
                  I beg your pardon?

                            DOTTIE
                    (Horrified but suspicious)
                  Who is this?

                            MOM
                  Mrs. Wilson from the telephone
                  company.  I understand you're
                  having problems with obscene calls.

                            DOTTIE
                       (Mortified)
                  Yes, I am...I'm sorry Mrs. Wilson..
                  It's driving me crazy...I've
                  changed my number twice already...
                  Please help me!

11.    INTERIOR SUTPHIN KITCHEN.

       ROSEMARY ACKERMAN walks through kitchen, wipes a
       finger on window ledge to check for dust and calls
       out Beverly's name.

12.    INTERIOR MOM'S BEDROOM.

       MOM doesn't hear MRS. ACKERMAN as she continues her
       phone conversation with MRS. HINKLE.

                            MOM
                   (Still the fake telephone
                    company representative)
                  What exactly does this sick
                  individual say to you?

                            DOTTIE
                  I can't say it out loud.
                  don't use bad language.

13.    INTERIOR MOM'S LIVING ROOM.

       MRS. ACKERMAN looks up at huge oil portrait of MOM
       in ornate frame hanging over couch and calls out
       Beverly's name.  Hearing muffled voices behind MOM'S
       closed bedroom door at the top of the steps, MRS.
       ACKERMAN begins to creep up the steps.

14.    INTERIOR MOM'S BEDROOM.

       Split screen with MOM and DOTTIE HINKLE.

                            MOM
                     (Still impersonating)
                  I know it's hard but we need
                  the exact words.

                            DOTTIE
                  Alright, I'll try...
                         (Primly)
                  "Cocksucker".  That's what
                  she calls me.

                            MOM
                   (Laughs hideously, begins
                    speaking in her scary voice)
                  Listen to your dirty mouth, you
                  fucking whore!

                            DOTTIE
                         (Ballistic)
                  GODDAMN YOU!

15.    INTERIOR HALLWAY OUTSIDE MOM'S BEDROOM.

       MRS. ACKERMAN hears muffled shouts and reaches for
       door handle.

16.    INTERIOR BEDROOM.  SPLIT SCREEN BETWEEN MOM AND
       DOTTIE.

                            DOTTIE
                  MOTHERFUCKER!!

                            MOM
                  COCKSUCKER!
                       (Slams down phone)

       MRS. ACKERMAN barges right in bedroom, almost
       catching MOM who expertly snaps back to normal
       without missing a beat.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  Beverly, are you alright?

                            MOM
                  Rosemary, honey.  Good morning.
                  I'm fine.
                     (Taking the sewing basket)
                  Thanks for remembering.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  It's the least I could do.
                       (Suspicious)
                  I heard shouting.

       MOM opens sewing box to reveal a pair of gleaming
       sewing scissors.

                            MOM
                       (Slamming it shut)
                  Just the damn cable TV company.
                  You know how they are.
                  Did you hear about Dottie Hinkle?

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  Yes, I did.  It's terrifying!
                  The police were at my house this
                  morning.

                            MOM
                  Who on earth would want to
                  harrass poor Dottie Hinkle?

17.    EXTERIOR DOTTIE HINKLE'S SUBURBAN HOUSE.

       DOTTIE HINKLE, still angry and occasionally cursing
       to herself, digs in her prize flower garden out
       front of her house behind ornamental wishing-well on
       front lawn.  Subtitle appears: "2:15pm" and then
       fades out.

       Cut to MOM, driving happily by in her station wagon
       as she waves to DOTTIE.

       DOTTIE sees MOM, tries to look cheerful and waves
       back.

       Cut back to MOM who looks in her rear view mirror,
       sees she's not being followed and suddenly screeches
       car into a U-turn as MOM's "Psycho Theme" plays on
       soundtrack

       MOM's face turns to stone as ripple flashback
       effects dissolve to that fateful day in the mall
       when MOM pulled up to parallel park and DOTTIE
       HINKLE stole her place from behind.

       Ripple effects dissolve to the present as the wheels
       of MOM'S car skid to a stop.  The car door opens and
       MOM's sensible shoes step out as "Mom Psycho Theme"
       builds.

       MOM closes car door quietly, watches DOTTIE HINKLE
       up the street undetected and then takes the scissors
       from her purse and hides them up her sleeve.

       As MOM sneaks up street towards DOTTIE, intercut are
       obsessional flashbacks of details of the traumatic
       parking place incident;  MOM'S POV of DOTTIE pulling
       into space, DOTTIE'S maddening nonchalance as she
       snottily gets out of her car and trots right past
       MOM without the slightest apology, MOM'S sputtering
       face paralyzed with anger when she realizes there is
       nowhere else to park.

       Back in the present, MOM starts walking faster and
       faster as she sees DOTTIE begin to pack up her
       gardening tools to go back inside her house.
         
       Arriving just a second too late as DOTTIE closes the
       door behind her, MOM spots a can of gasoline near
       DOTTIE's lawnmower.  Thinking fast, MOM dumps gas on
       DOTTIE's mail in the mailbox on porch, lights it on
       fire and runs from the flames, happily throwing a
       coin into DOTTIE's wishing well as an afterthought.
         
       MOM walks as fast as possible back to her car, gets
       in and pulls off.  Smiling evily to herself, she
       drives by and sees DOTTIE HINKLE screaming in horror
       and trying to beat the fire out with a broom.

18.    EXTERIOR TOWSON SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL.

       Parking lot is filled and the few last parents are
       entering the building for PTA meeting.  MOM speeds
       into lot and gets out of car.  Subtitle appears:
       "3:O6pm" and fades out.

19.    INTERIOR CLASSROOM.

       MR. STUBBINS, Chip's teacher, is winding down a
       one-on-one meeting with another mother, who is in
       tears.

                            MRS. TAPLOTTER
                  But, Mr. Stubbins, my son
                  studies every night!  He's
                  trying as hard as he can...

                            MR. STUBBINS
                  Some teenagers just aren't college
                  material, Mrs, Taplotter.  It's
                  nothing to cry over.  Now, there
                  are other parents waiting.
                       (Smugly)
                  ...thank you for taking the time
                  to come to PTA.

20.    INTERIOR SCHOOL HALLWAY.  OUTSIDE MR. STUBBINS'
       CLASSROOM.

       Parents are seated in folding chairs waiting to be
       called in to conference.  MOM comes rushing down
       corridor and other parents greet her.

                            MRS. STERNER
                  Hi, Beverly.

                            MOM
                  Hi, Betty.  Oh, I love your
                  outfit.

                            MRS. STERNER
                  Thanks.
                          (Snobbily)
                  It's a Liz Claiborne.

                            MR. STERNER
                  Mrs. Sutphin, where's that
                  husband of yours?
                   (Making a bad dental joke
                    and pointing to his teeth)
                  Feeling "down in the mouth"?!
                  Hohohohohoho!

                            MOM
                    (Smiling through her teeth)
                  You're soooo funny, Ralph...

       MR. STUBBINS leans his head out of classroom and
       looks at roll book as MRS. TAPLOTTER leaves, dabbing
       her tears with a handkerchief.

                            MR. STUEBINS
                  Mrs...Sutphin?

                            MOM
                       (Excited)
                  Right here!

       MOM goes in classroom with him.

21.    INTERIOR CLASSROOM.

                            MR. STUBBINS
                  Mrs. Sutphin, I'm Paul Stubbins,
                  Chip's math teacher.

                            MOM
                       (Shaking hands)
                  Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.
                       (Handing him a tin)
                  A little something I baked.

                            MR. STUBBINS
                       (Peeking inside)
                  Oooohh!  A fruit cake.  Thank
                  you, Mrs. Sutphin.  Have a seat.

                            MOM
                  Bon Appetit!

       They sit on opposite sides of his desk.

                            MR. STUBBINS
                  Chip is off to a fine start
                  this year.
                       (Checking his roll book)
                  Focused...conscientious...
                  participates actively in
                  classroom discussion.

                            MOM
                       (Proudly)
                  He's a good boy.

                            MR. STUBBINS
                       (Suddenly serious)
                  There is one big problem though.

       MOM'S smile freezes on her face ever so subtly

                            MOM
                  What is it, Mr. Stubbins?

                            MR. STUBBINS
                       (Spitting out the words)
                  His unhealthy obsession with
                  sick horror films.

                            MOM
                       (Relieved)
                  He is assistant manager of a
                  video shop...

                            MR. STUBBINS
                       (Cutting her off)
                  That's no excuse for a morbid
                  imagination.  I caught him
                  drawing this in class last week.
                   (Unfolds lurid drawing of woman
                    getting her tongue pulled out
                    with the title, "Blood Feast")
                  Is there a problem at home?

                            MOM
                       (Shocked)
                  Certainly not!

                            MR. STUBBINS
                  Divorce?  An alcoholic relative?
                       (Knowingly)
                  Tell me, did Chip torture animals
                  when he was young?

                            MOM
                       (Furious)
                  No, he did not! We are a loving
                  supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.

                            MR. STUBBINS
                  Well, you're doing something
                  wrong, Mrs. Sutphin.  I'd
                  recommend therapy for your son.
                       (Rising from his chair)
                  Thank you for taking the time
                  to come to PTA.

23.    INTERIOR CHIP'S BEDROOM.

       On CHIP's large video screen plays the ridiculously
       dated but still appalling scene from "BLOOD FEAST"
       where the madman with the corny, madeup eyebrows
       rips a girl's tongue out of her mouth in hokey
       special effects.

       Subtitle reads "4:22pm" and fades out.

       CHIP and BIRDIE are hooting and hollering and eating
       popcorn as SCOTTY looks up from his vintage
       nudist-camp magazine to watch in real horror and
       nausea.

                            BIRDIE
                  It's a sheep's tongue!

                            SCOTTY
                  Man, I just ate.  Turn it off.

                            CHIP
                  Rewind it!  Let's see it again!

                            SCOTTY
                  No!  That shit is sickening!
                  Put on pussy!

                            BIRDIE
                       (Torturing SCOTTY)
                  Look, Dick-Head!
                       (Gore scene replays)
                  SLOW-MOTION!

       SCOTTY starts to gag and tries to hide it,

                            BIRDIE
                       (Looking at screen)
                  BLOOD FEAST!

                  The "Citizen Kane" of gore
                  movies.

       SCOTTY looks at gore on video, jumps up to run to
       bathroom, yanks open bedroom door and screams when
       he sees MOM standing there with a plate of chocolate
       chip cookies.

                            MOM
                  I don't know what it is about
                  today, but I FEEL GREAT!

                            SCOTTY
                       (Gagging)
                  Excuse me, Mrs. Sutphin.

       He runs past her to the bathroom.

                            CHIP
                  Hi, Mom.

                            BIRDIE
                  Hi, Mrs. Sutphin.

       MOM looks at TV monitor and sees madman taking out
       heart of girl.  MOM smiles inappropriately.

                            MOM
                       (Giggles)
                  You kids.  Now Birdie, I want
                  you to have a cookie and then
                  run along home.

                            CHIP
                  But Mom, the video's not over.

                            MOM
                  No "but mom" for you, young man.
                  Mr. Stubbins seems to think these
                  silly movies are interfering with
                  your studies.
                   (Turns off video with remote)

                            BIRDIE
                       (Rolling her eyes)
                  Oh, boy!
                       (Getting ready to leave)

                            CHIP
                  Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!

       SCOTTY comes back in room feeling better.

                            SCOTTY
                  Man, that one made me puke!

                            MOM
                   (Picking up SCOTTY's nudist
                    camp magazine and handing it
                    back to him like it's poison)
                  You forgot something...

                            SCOTTY
                       (Looking around confused)
                  Are we leaving?

                            MOM
                  Yes you are.

       SCOTTY guiltily takes back magazine as BIRDIE drags
       him out.

                            BIRDIE
                  Bye, Mrs, Sutphin.

                            CHIP
                       (Affectionately)
                  Bye, bird-brain,  See ya, Scotty.

                            MOM
                  Bye, Birdie.
                   (Sitting down next to CHIP
                       on his bed)
                  Chip, honey...I know it's hard
                  being a teenager but I understand..
                  I'm your mother and I love you.

                            CHIP
                  Oh Mom...

                            MOM
                       (Suddenly his buddy)
                  Can we watch that scene again?
                  You know, where he rips out
                  her heart?
                       (Giggling scarily)
                  PLEEEASE?

       CHIP looks back at his MOM in sudden confusion.

                  perfect meatloaf!

                            DAD
                  Nothing like a home cooked
                  meal, honey.

                            MOM
                  Misty, I made your favorite
                  sesame broccoli...
                       (Passes it to her)

                            MISTY
                  Yummy.  Carl says if I lose
                  ten pounds, he'll take me to
                  the University of Maryland
                  Fall Mixer.

                            MOM
                       (Appalled)
                  Misty, if you want to lose
                  weight go ahead, but do it for
                  yourself, not for some boy you
                  barely know.

                            CHIP
                  Carl's a jerk!

                            DAD
                  He certainly drives like a jerk.

                            MISTY
                       (Getting upset)
                  Carl makes me happy and that
                  threatens this family, doesn't it?

                            DAD
                  Doesn't threaten me, honey.
                  I'm happy.

                            MOM
                  I'm happy too and we want you
                  to be happy.

                            CHIP
                       (Mockingly)
                  I'm so happy I could shit.

                            MOM
                  CHIP!  You know how much I
                  hate the brown word!

       Suddenly a scream from outside is heard.

26.    EXTERIOR SUTPHIN HOUSE.

       ROSEMARY ACKERMAN, the busy-body next door neighbor
       is running across lawn from her house to the
       Sutphins.
         
                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  Beverly!  Beverly!

27.    INTERIOR SUTPHIN DINING ROOM.

       Family is getting up from table in alarm.

                            MOM
                  That's Rosemary.  Something's
                  wrong!

       CHIP and MISTY look at one another and stick fingers
       down their throats at mention of MRS. ACKERMAN'S
       name.

       ROSEMARY ACKERMAN runs in from kitchen in hysterics.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  Turn on the news!
                       (To CHIP)
                  A teacher at your school has
                  been murdered!

                            MISTY
                       (Appalled)
                  Murdered?

                            CHIP
                  Who?

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  A Mr. Stubber...or Stubbins.

                            CHIP
                       (Horrified)
                  MR. STUBBINS?  That's my
                  math teacher!

28.    INTERIOR SUTPHIN LIVING ROOM.

       DAD runs in and turns on TV as family and MRS.
       ACKERMAN follow and watch under MOM's framed
       portrait on wail.

                            DAD
                  What channel?

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  It's on all of them!

       Phone rings.  CHIP grabs the receiver.

                            CHIP
                  Hello.

       We see BIRDIE in split screen.

                            BIRDIE
                       (Excited)
                  Did you hear?

                            CHIP
                  What happened?

                            BIRDIE
                  This is so cool! It's just like
                  a horror movie.

       ANNOUNCER comes on TV.

                            CHIP
                  It's on!  I'll call you back!
                       (Hangs up)

                            ANNOUNCER
                  ..Police claim the driver of
                  the hit and run vehicle ran
                  down the teacher in cold blood
                  and then backed up over his
                  body to finish off the job.
                  Mr. Paul Stubbins was
                  thirty-eight years old...

                            DAD
                           (Mad)
                  Whoever did it should get the
                  death penalty!

       MOM yawns absentmindedly.

                            ANNOUNCER
                  ...So far only one eyewitness
                  has surfaced.

       MOM looks up in sudden fear as LU-ANN, the trashy
       pot-smoking girl who witnessed murder appears on
       screen.

                            LUANN
                  It was a blue car...I know that
                  much!

                            CHIP
                  That's Lu-Ann Hodges!

                  She's a pothead!

                            LUANN
                  ...A blue station wagon...

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  That's like your car, Beverly,

                            MOM
                     (Glaring at MRS. ACKERMAN)
                  I'm not that bad a driver.
                     (Disapprovingly at TV screen)
                  Look at her hair!
                       (To CHIP)
                  Turn it off, honey.

                       (In shock)
                  I can't believe Mr. Stubbins
                  is dead.

                            MISTY
                  You said you hated him.

                            CHIP
                  Well...he was an asshole...
                  but he didn't deserve to die!

29.    SUTPHIN MASTER BEDROOM.

       Wipe to MOM finishing a silent prayer kneeling next
       to bed as DAD reads a spy novel under the covers.
       Subtitle appears: "10:45pm" and fades out.

                            DAD
                    (Putting down his book
                     as MOM climbs in)
                  I can't stop thinking about
                  that poor teacher.
                    (Turning out light on
                     his side of bed)
                  Goodnight, honey.  Don't read
                  late, we've got a big day with
                  the birds tomorrow.

                            MOM
                   (Picking up and leafing through
                    "The Encyclopedia of Birds")
                  I've identified every little
                  birdie we're going to watch
                  tomorrow on the Eastern Shore.

       We see that underneath the cover of the bird book,
       MOM is reading "Helter Skelter".  She lightly
       caresses a picture of Manson and closes the book and
       turns out her light.

                            DAD
                  Goodnight, honey.

                            MOM
                  Don't I get a kiss?

                            DAD
                       (Moving closer)
                  I just thought with all the
                  sadness...you wouldn't want...

                            MOM
                       (Snuggling up)
                  We have to concentrate on
                  life, Eugene.

                            DAD
                       (Kissing her)
                  It's fine with me, Beverly.
                   (Kisses her again more
                    passionately)
                  You want to, honey?  You
                  think the kids are asleep?

                            MOM
                  We can be real quiet...

                            DAD
                       (Getting on top of her)
                  I love that you're my wife.

                            MOM
                       (Getting turned on)
                  You're not bad yourself,
                  coo-coo bird...

                            DAD
                   (Gently making love to her)
                  You bring me such peace...

                            MOM
                  Oohhhh, Eugene!

                            DAD
                  Shhhh..

                            MOM
                       (Getting louder)
                  Oooohhhh.

                            DAD
                  Don't wake the kids...

                            MOM
                       (Even louder)
                  Ooohhhh!

30.    MISTY'S BEDROOM.

       We see MISTY, hair in curlers, pricing junk for flea
       market, stop and listen to sounds coming from
       parents' bedroom.

31.    SUTPHIN BEDROOM.

       MOM and DAD are having romantic monogomous sex.

                            MOM
                  Oooohhh!  Yeah!  Yeah!

                            DAD
                       (Really turned on)
                  You're hot tonight, honey...
                  but be quiet!  Shhhh! The kids!

32.    CHIP'S BEDROOM.

       CHIP looks up from reading "Fangoria Magazine" and
       listens in horror to his mother's distant moaning.

33.    SUTPHIN BEDROOM.

       MOM is panting wildly, a suburban sex machine.  DAD
       is amazed but hardly complaining.

                            MOM
                  Yeah!  Oohhhh!  Get it!

                            DAD
                  Ooh, honey, I'm ready!
                  Now!  Now!

                            MOM
                   (In orgasm, wildly thrashing)
                  Oohhhhh!  Yeah!  Yeah!

34.    HALLWAY BETWEEN CHIP AND MISTY'S BEDROOMS.

       CHIP and MISTY open bedroom doors simultaneously,
       hear their parents climaxing and look at one another
       in complete horror.

       Fade to black.

35.    Slow fade in to EXTERIOR SUTPHIN HOUSE.

       Birds are heard greeting the sunrise with their
       happy chirping.  Subtitle appears "Saturday,
       September l9th, 5:3Oam" and fade out.

36.    INTERIOR SUTPHIN BEDROOM.

       MOM, dressed for bird-watching day-trip, watches the
       cute little chickadees nibbling seed out of her
       birdfeeder on lawn through binoculars from bedroom
       window.  DAD, half-awake, stirs in his bed.

                            MOM
                   (Tracking a particularly
                    cute bird)
                  There's Dede! He's my favorite
                  chickadee!  He's here every
                  morning for breakfast.

                            DAD
                       (Groggy)
                  Well, honey, chickadees breed
                  in Alaska, you know.  No wonder
                  Dede's hungry.  It's a long
                  trip all the way to Baltimore.

       MOM continues tracking the bird in her binoculars
       until she freezes in horror at the sight of MRS.
       ACKERMAN running her mouth next door to DETECTIVES
       MOORE and BRADFORD and pointing to MOM's car.

       Suddenly the phone rings with jangling intensity.
       MOM jumps.

                            DAD
                  Hello...

       On split screen is obnoxious man from PTA, MR.
       STERNER, holding his jaw in pain.

                            MR. STERNER
                  Eugene, it's Ralph Sterner.
                  Got a dental emergency here!
                       (Moans in pain)
                  I mean this goddamn tooth is
                  killing me!

                            DAD
                  Well, Mr. Sterner, if you
                  call my office, I'm sure we
                  can see you Monday.

       MOM starts shaking her head "No" to DAD just in
       case.

                            MR. STERNER
                  MONDAY?

       MRS. STERNER, his wife, grabs the phone.

                            MRS. STERNER
                  Eugene, this is Betty Sterner,
                  He'll die by Monday!  The
                  roots are infected!  He might
                  have a heart attack!

                            DAD
                       (Wearily)
                  All right, Mrs. Sterner...
                  Nine o'clock.

       MOM's face changes to purple rage as she turns to
       hide her anger from DAD.

                            DAD
                       (Hangs up)
                  I'm sorry, honey.  But the birds
                  will still be there next week.

                            MOM
                   (Turning to face DAD,
                    suddenly stoic)
                  It's Ok, Eugene.  I understand..
                  I'll go fix breakfast.
                       (Exits calmly)

37.    INTERIOR HALLWAY OUTSIDE SUTPHIN'S BEDROOM.

       MOM's calm turns to immediate rage as she closes
       bedroom door and storms her way downstairs as "Mom's
       Psycho Theme" blares on soundtrack.

38.    CHIP'S BEDROOM

       CHIP is sound asleep.  MOM enters in a fury.

                            MOM
                    (In his ear, loudly)
                  CHIP!!

                            CHIP
                      (Jumping up in fear
                       from sleep)
                  God, Mom!
                   (Looking at her scary face)
                  What's the matter?

                            MOM
                      (Back to normal,
                          sweetly)
                  Time to get up, that's all.
                  You'll be late for work.

39.    INTERIOR SUTPHIN KITCHEN.

       MISTY is sobbing in fury as she sits forlornly with
       boxed up flea-market junk.  MOM enters and is
       startled to see her.

                            MOM
                   Honey, what's the matter?

       MOM looks out back window in alarm to see DET. MOORE
       snooping through her box of recycled newspapers as
       DET. BRADFORD noses around her station wagon.

                            MISTY
                  I'm stoodup!  I'll kill
                  that bastard!

                            MOM
                  Don't say words unless you
                  mean them, Misty.
                   (Starts fixing breakfast)

       COPS bang loudly on door.  MOM jumps.

                            MISTY
                  It's him!

                            MOM
                  No, honey, it's the police.
                   (Opens back door)
                  Hello, officers.

       Subtitle appears "7:10am" and then fades out.

                            DET. BRADFORD
                  Good morning, Mrs. Sutphin.

                   (Subtly unbuttoning her
                    blouse one button)
                  Hi, Detective Moore.

                            DET. MOORE
                       (Embarrassed)
                  Morning, Misty.
                       (All business)
                  Mrs. Sutphin, I presume you heard
                  of the death of Mr. Stubbins.

                            MOM
                  A fine man.  A good teacher...

                            MOM
                       (In sympathy)
                  What a mess.

       MOM sees SCOTTY pull up in driveway with BIRDIE in
       his convertible.

                            MOM
                    (Seeing MISTY's eyes light
                     up at hearing a car)
                  No, honey, it's just Scotty.
                       (To COPS)
                  Scotty, who doesn't wear his
                  seatbelts!

        DAD and CHIP enter kitchen as BIRDIE and SCOTTY
        barge in back door.

                            DAD
                  Good morning, Detectives.

                            BIRDIE

                  Did you drive your car to the
                  PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs.
                  Sutphin?

                            MOM
                       (Buttering toast)
                  Yes, I did.

                            DAD
                       (To cops, getting angry)
                  Detectives, what is this about?

                            DET. MOORE
                  I know this sounds weird,
                  Mr. Sutphin, but the Department
                  of Motor Vehicle's computer shows
                  only one blue station wagon
                  registered to a parent of any
                  of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.

                            DAD
                  Surely you don't think Beverly
                  was involved!

                            SCOTTY
                       (Hamming it up,
                        pointing to MOM)
                  SHE DID IT!  Aimed the car right
                  at Mr. Stubbins and mowed him
                  down!

                            MOM
                       (Quickly staring daggers at

                        addressing COPS)
                  From what I understand, the
                  eye-witness is a drug user.

                            MISTY
                  I got somebody you could
                  run over, Mother!

                            DAD
                  Misty, that's a terrible
                  thing to say!
                    (Putting his arm
                     protectively around MOM)
                  Detectives, it's time for you
                  to leave.  My wife knows
                  nothing about this terrible
                  ...accident.

                            MOM
                       (Correcting him)
                  Murder, honey.

       COPS see magazine cover with the "P" in "People" cut
       out as in threatening note sent to Mrs. Ackerman.

                            DET. MOORE
                       (Suspiciously)
                  Let's see that, young man.

                     she ogles him from behind)

                  ...People who don't mind their
                  own business.

       DAD looks at MOM suddenly, for the first time
       showing slight suspicion.

                            MOM
                       (To DAD)
                  It's Mrs. Ackerman's magazine,
                  honey.

                  Look at the subscription label
                  if you don't believe me.
                       (Proudly)
                  I recycle my magazines.

40.    Wipe to EXTERIOR MRS. ACKERMAN'S HOUSE.

       MRS. ACKERMAN is dumping all her bottles and
       newspapers into the rest of her garbage without the
       slightest thought of recycling.  Subtitle appears
       "10:06am" and fades out.

       Cut to GUS and SLOPPY, two Baltimore County
       sanitation workers as they pick up bags of
       neighbors' recycled trash and scowl in hatred at the
       environmentally incorrect MRS. ACKERMAN.

41.    INTERIOR SUTPHIN KITCHEN.

       MOM, now alone, is happily separating her cans and
       plastic trash into proper recycle bins as she rocks
       out singing along with the Barry Manilow record
       "Daybreak" that spins on her high-fi set.

                            MOM
                      (Singing and dancing
                       in place as soulfully
                       as possible for her)
                  "It's Daybreak"
                  If you want to believe
                  It can be Daybreak!..."

       MOM looks out through her kitchen window and sees
       MRS. ACKERMAN dumping styrofoam packing chips in
       with the rest of her un-recycled garbage.  Freezing
       in horror, MOM then lunges for MRS. ACKERMAN's
       gleaming sewing scissors in borrowed sewing basket
       and begins to run out door.

       Suddenly MOM sees the friendly GARBAGEMEN waving to
       her from truck.  She quickly puts back the scissors,
       grabs her recyle bags, locates two "miniatures" of
       liquor hidden in kitchen cabinet and runs out back
       door.

42.    EXTERIOR SUTPHIN HOUSE.

       MRS. ACKERMAN goes back inside her house as MOM
       charges out to meet GARBAGEMEN with her recyclables.

                            MOM
                  Don't forget me, boys!
                       (Holding up blue bags)
                  All rinsed and ready to
                  recycle!

                    (Sneakily handing them
                     miniatures)
                  Here you go.  You work hard
                  for the environment.  A little
                  drink never hurt anybody.

                            SLOPPY
                  Thanks, ma'am.
                       (Takes a big swig)
                  Damn!  Good stuff.
                   (Looking at MRS. ACKERMAN's

                  to one hundred years for a tin
                  can to decompose but she still
                  won't recycle.

                  Yeah, hack her up and recycle

                  My Franklin Mint Faberge Egg!

                            MOM
                       (Helping MRS. ACKERMAN)
                  Dottie didn't mean to be a
                  clumsy ox.  She's sorry,
                  Aren't you, Dottie?

                            DOTTIE
                       (Pleading)
                  Rosemary, I didn't break your
                  egg - she did!

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  You could at least apologize,
                  Dottie.  I collect Franklin Mint!

                            MOM
                  And we're going right to the
                  flea market to get another one!
                  Misty tells me there's a whole
                  booth of Franklin Mint stuff.
                  Dottie, you lock up.
                       (Evily)
                  I'll take care of poor Rosemary!

                            DOTTIE
                       (Stammering in fear to
                        MRS. ACKERMAN)
                  But...but...she...Rosemary, I
                  heard her voice!  It's her, I
                  tell you, IT'S HER!

46.    INTERIOR DAD'S DENTAL EXAMINATION ROOM.

       DAD attempts to do dental work on RALPH STERNER, the
       "emergency" patient who lets out a blood curdling
       scream every time DAD gets the drill anywhere near
       his mouth.

                            DAD
                  Mr. Sterner, you've lost a tiny
                  filling.  I have to drill deeply
                  enough to remove all the decay.

                            MR. STERNER
                       (Whimpering)
                  Alright...go ahead...but be
                  careful, it really hurts!
                       (Opens mouth)

       DAD begins to drill again.

                            MR. STERNER
                  OWWWWW'! Goddamn you!  You're
                  hurting me on purpose!

47.    DENTAL WAITING ROOM.

       MRS. STERNER, reading an old issue of Newsweek, with
       Jeffrey Dahmer on the cover, jumps up and runs to
       her husband past the RECEPTIONIST.

48.    INTERIOR DAD'S EXAMINATION ROOM.

                            MRS. STERNER
                       (Running in)
                  Are you ok, Ralph?

                            DAD
                  Mrs. Sterner, please stay in
                  the waiting room!

                            MR. STERNER
                  Help me, Betty!  He's worse
                  than the dentist in "The
                  Marathon Man"!

                            RECEPTIONIST
                       (Poking her head in)
                  Sorry to interrupt, Dr. Sutphin,
                  but there's two police detectives
                  here to see you...

49.    INTERIOR DAD'S TINY OFFICE.

       DET. MOORE and DET. BRADFORD wait grim-faced in the
       office.  Subtitle appears "10:35am" and fades out.

                            DAD
                       (Entering)
                  What is it, officers?
                  My patient is waiting.

                            DET. MOORE
                  Dr. Sutphing is your wife a
                  big reader?

                            DAD
                  Bird books mostly...

                            DET. BRADFORD
                  Like these we found in
                  her garbage?
                       (Showing him the book)
                  "Urge To Kill".  "Mass Murder
                  in Houston"?

                            DAD
                  I'm sure those are my son,
                  Chip's books.

                            DET. MOORE
                  No, they're your wife's.  We
                  checked,  She bought them
                  down at "The Browse and Learn
                  Bookshop" along with a few other
                  titles...

                            DET. BRADFORD

                  Master Card reference number 7876.
                  Dated June 5th.

                            DAD
                       (Seeing their suspicions
                        of MOM are serious)
                  THIS IS RIDICULOUS!!

                            DET. BRADFORD
                  Dr. Sutphin, is you wife mental?

50.    OUTDOOR FLEA MARKET.  EDMONSON DRIVE-IN THEATER.

       Cut to MOM's face, seemingly in the middle of a
       frenzy as she jumps around like a crazy person.
       Camera pulls back and we see that she is swatting
       away a persistent bee as she sits with MISTY at her
       flea market table.

       Subtitle appears "11:20am" and then disappears.
         
                            MOM
                  Damn these yellow-jackets!
                  I hate 'em!

                            MISTY
                       (Angrily)
                  Always something isn't it?
                       (To CUSTOMER)
                  Can I help you?

                            CUSTOMER
                  Just looking.
                        (Walks away)

                            MISTY
                  Thanks for not buying anything!

                            MOM
                  Misty, lighten up.  It's not
                  the customer's fault Carl stood
                  you up!

       MOM looks over two rows and sees CARL walking
       through the flea market with a SEXPOT DATE.  Her
       face turns to stone but she doesn't let on to MISTY.

       Cut to MRS. ACKERMAN shopping passionately at the
       nearby Franklin Mint booth.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                       (To VENDOR)
                  Young man, this Faberge Egg is
                  chipped.

                            VENDOR
                  Yes, ma'am, it is.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  I'll give you fifty cents.

                            VENDOR
                  That's a Franklin Mint piece.
                  Eight dollars.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  Eight dollars?!  Franklin Mint
                  or not, it's damaged goods!
                       (Puts it back)

       MRS. ACKERMAN bends over grumbling and sees a fire
       poker marked with a price tag of $6.O0.  Sneakily
       she switches price tag of $3.00 from another item.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  I'll take this instead.

                            VENDOR
                  Nice one, huh?  Winter's coming.
                       (Looking at price
                        momentarily hesit'ating)
                  Three dollars?...I guess that's
                  what I marked it...

       MRS. ACKERMAN smirks and pays him.

       MRS. ACKERMAN comes back to MISTY's booth carrying
       fire poker.

                            MOM
                  (Seeing MRS. ACKERMAN1s
                   purchase, but still watching
                   CARL and SEXPOT DATE in distance)
                  Did you find your Franklin Mint
                  egg, Rosemary darling?

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  I saw one, but it was ridiculously
                  overpriced!

                            MOM
                       (Seeing MRS. ACKERMAN's
                        fire poker)
                  You want me to keep that under
                  the table for you?

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  If you wouldn't mind...
                       (Gives it to her)
                  It was on sale.

       Cut to CARL browsing at same Franklin Mint booth
       that MRS. ACKERMAN was shopping in earlier.  SEXPOT
       DATE is drooling over chipped Faberge Egg and
       batting her eyes at CARL.

                            SEXPOT DATE
                       (In baby talk)
                  Honey, pleeease?  For my little
                  knick-knack shelf?

                            CARL
                       (To VENDOR)
                  Wrap it up for the little
                  lady.

       Cut to MOM with the fire poker partially concealed
       under her coat as she stalks CARL and SEXPOT DATE to
       baseball memorabilia booth.  MOM pretends to shop
       nearby as CARL buys Oriole penant for himself.

       MOM follows them to concession stand where CARL
       excuses himself for a quick trip to the men's room.
       SEXPOT DATE adjusts her cleavage as she waits, much
       to the embarrassment of YOUNG BOY walking by.

       Realizing the coast is clear, MOM darts into men's
       room following CARL.

51.    INTERIOR MEN'S ROOM.

       CARL is at urinal.  Subtitle appears "11:57am" and
       fades out.  MOM rushes in unnoticed and tries to
       enter first booth and finds it locked,  She scurries
       to next booth and enters.

       A male PERVERT in locked booth is drawing dirty
       pictures on the wall.  He looks down and sees MOM's
       shoes under the stall and starts moaning sexually as
       he writes "EAT ME" with a magic marker.

       Closeup of CARL's face as he pisses like a
       racehorse.

       PERVERT looks through peep-hole between booths and
       sees MOM and moans in silent orgasm.

       MOM pulls fire poker out from under her coat.

       PERVERT zips up in a panic and flees bathroom in
       fear.

       Suddenly MOM runs from her booth with fire poker
       drawn and skewers CARL in the back at the urinal.

       CARL screams in horror as MOM pulls out fire poker
       with his liver skewered on the end.

       CARL collapses to his knees, his head landing in
       urinal.

       MOM looks horrified at the liver and tries to shake
       it off poker, panicked that someone will come into
       men's room.

       Closing her eyes in revulsion, she pulls off liver
       with her fingertips and throws it on floor.

       Running from men's room, she slips in gore, catches
       her balance, looks back at CARL's head in urinal,
       hesitates and finally runs back to flush toilet
       before escaping undetected.

52.    MISTY'S FLEA MARKET TABLE.

       A hip young couple are buying a hideous amateur oil
       painting of Don Knotts from MISTY.

                            BOY
                  I can't believe it!  Fuckin'
                  Don Knotts!

                            GIRL
                       (Happily)
                  It's beyond ugly!

                            MISTY
                     (Giving them back change)
                  There you go...

       Cut to MOM approaching, looking happy and composed
       with fire poker concealed under her coat.

                            MOM
                       (Calling out)
                  Misty, honey, look!
                   (Holding up a set of
                    cereal bowls)
                  I made a killing!

53.    INTERIOR MEN'S ROOM.

       A MACHO MAN enters nibbling lamb off a shishkobab.
       He sees CARL's body and screams in the best Fay Ray
       tradition.  Subtitle appears "l2:llpm" and then
       fades out.

54.    MISTY'S FLEA MARKET TABLE.

       MOM is showing MISTY her new cereal bowl as MRS.
       ACKERMAN returns.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                       (Upset)
                  I went back to get my Faberge
                  Egg and some idiot bought it!

       Sirens are heard in the distance.

                            MOM
                    (Caressing fire poker
                     back under table,
                     threateningly)
                  It's just not your day, is
                  it Rosemary?

                           MISTY
                   (Seeing cop cars and
                    ambulance enter flea market
                    as customers start running
                    towards concession stand)
                  Watch the booth!  I'll be back!
                   (Runs off to join the crowd)

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                      (Spotting a small hunk
                       of gore stuck to bottom
                       of MOM's shoe)
                  Beverly, honey, you've got some...
                       (Wrinkles up her nose)
                  ...do-do on your shoe.

                            MOM
                  Ewwww!
                       (Wipes it off on grass)
                  Thank you, Rosemary.

       MRS. ACKERMAN notices stain with odd unease.

55.    EXTERIOR CONCESSION STAND.

       COPS are holding back CARL'S sobbing and hysterical
       SEXPOT DATE as she clutches her Faberge Egg while
       PARAMEDICS remove CARL'S body from the mens room on
       a stretcher.

       DET. MOORE and BRADFORD are roughly frisking
       bathroom PERVERT.

                            PERVERT
                  There was a lady in the men's
                  room!  I swear! A pretty little
                  lady in the stall right next
                  to me!

       MISTY pushes her way through rubbernecking crowd
       until she finally sees CARL'S face right before the
       PARAMEDICS give the final zip to the body bag.  She
       lets out a blood-curdling scream.

       DET. BRADFORD looks up into MISTY's horror filled
       face and turns in suspicion to DET. MOORE only to
       see his partner making eyes with SEXPOT DATE, who in
       between sobs, is flirting back with all her might.

56.    MISTY'S BOOTH.

       MRS. ACKERMAN is looking in revulsion at what
       appears to be dried blood on the end of her
       fire-poker stored under the flea market table as MOM
       happily sells Pee-Wee Herman doll to New York
       dealer.

                            MOM
                  That's one-hundred fifty-eight
                  dollars.

                            DEALER
                  Will you take a New York check?

                            MOM
                  Certainly.

       MRS. ACKERMAN reaches down and touches the end of
       fire poker and almost faints when she sees red on
       her fingertips.

       MISTY hysterically returns to booth, crying and
       screaming.

                            MISTY
                  Mother!  It's Carl!
                  He's dead!

       MRS. ACKERMAN looks in sudden fear at MOM.

                            MOM
                  0h, that's horrible, honey.
                       (Suddenly cheerful)
                  I sold the Pee-Wee Herman
                  doll!!

                            MISTY
                       (Appalled)
                  Mother!  Did you hear me?!
                  Someone murdered Carl in the
                  mensroom!  I saw his dead body!

                            MOM
                       (Quietly, sweetly)
                  You got your wish.

                            MISTY
                       (Stunned)
                  But...
                       (Backs away)
                  I didn't wish...I didn't
                  want him DEAD!

       MRS. ACKERMAN gulps in horror.

57.    INTERIOR MOM'S BEDROOM.

       DAD is frantically searching through MOM's stuff and
       finds a scrapbook which is filled page after page
       with newspaper clippings about famous mass
       murderers.  He gasps in horror and then looks
       between mattress and box-springs and finds a stack
       of letters and a few cassette tapes.  He looks in
       shock at return address of first letter - "Richard
       Speck, Statesville Correctional Center, Joliet,
       Illinois 60434".  He tears open envelope and out
       falls an 8xlO glossy photo of a naked Richard Speck
       with the inscription "To Beverly.  Love, Richard
       Speck".  Shaking his head in horror, DAD puts
       cassette in tape player and pushes play button.  The
       voice on the tape booms out in bedroom, "Beverly,
       it's me, Ted Bundy.  It's late at night six days
       before my execution and it's lonely here on death
       row...".  DAD lunges for machine to push OFF button
       and accidentally turns on the radio.

                            NEWS ANNOUNCER
                  ...Updating the top story of
                  the hour, the young man brutally
                  murdered a short time ago in the
                  mens room of the Edmonson Flea
                  Market has been identified as
                  22 year old Carl Padgett of
                  Towson...

       DAD slams down OFF button on radio and sobs in
       shock.

58.    INTERIOR "SUBURBAN CULT VIDEO SHOP".

       CHIP1 on duty as manager, along with BIRDIE and
       SCOTTY and a few other horror-nut customers watch on
       large video monitor Joan Crawford get off a train in
       William Castle's "Straight Jacket".  The suspense
       builds as Joan on video spies through a window at
       her husband with another woman, picks up an ax and
       cuts off his head.  Suddenly MISTY runs into video
       shop in hysterics.

                            MISTY
                  Chip!  Our mother is Charles
                  Manson!

       All the kids laugh uproarously as Joan screams on
       video "I'm not guilty" while struggling in a
       straight jacket.

                            MISTY
                   (Grabbing the remote and
                    turning off the video)
                       (To CHIP)
                  I'm not kidding.  Carl stood
                  me up this morning and then
                  he was murdered at the flea
                  market....

                            CHIP
                  MURDERED?!!

                            MISTY
                  Yes murdered!  You said you
                  hated your teacher yesterday
                  and he was murdered too.  I
                  don't know...maybe Mom's nuts!

                            CHIP
                  It's a cool idea, Misty!
                  Let's make a gore movie about
                  Mom!  Better yet, a TV series!

                            BIRDIE
                  Can I borrow your mother?
                  My aunt is coming over to dinner
                  tonight and she's always on my
                  nerves.

                            KID
                  My step-father is an asshole!
                  She could kill him!

                            CHIP
                       (Baiting MISTY)
                  How about Mrs. Ackerman?
                  We both hate her!
                       (Playfully)
                  Should she be the next victim?

                            MISTY
                  No!  Stop it!  It's not funny.
                  Mom might do it!
                       (Sobbing)
                  Someone else might die.

                            SCOTTY
                       (Comforting her)
                  I believe you, Misty.
                  Your mother could kill - I've
                  seen that look in her eyes!
                           (Timidly)
                  Is there a reward or anything?

59.    DISSOLVE TO INTERIOR SUTPHIN DINING ROOM.

       MOM comes through kitchen door and serves a fancy
       tuna casserole.

                            MOM
                  Dinner's served!

       Subtitle appears "6:01pm" and then fades out.

       MISTY looks at her mother in terror.  DAD treats MOM
       with kid gloves.  CHIP is completely oblivious to
       their concern.

                            DAD
                  Let's say grace and pray
                  that we have the strength to
                  understand the terrible
                  tragedies of the last few days.

                            MOM
                  Amen to that.
                       (Happily)
                  It's been a crazy day, hasn't it?!

       MISTY pales, DAD looks at MOM in fear.

60.    MRS. ACKERMAN'S LIVING ROOM.

       DET. MOORE and several other COPS are taking down
       every word MRS. ACKERMAN says in notebooks and on
       tape recorders.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  ...Dottie Hinkle was right - IT
                  IS BEVERLY SUTPHIN!  I tell you
                  I saw blood right on the bottom
                  of her shoes!  Not exactly blood
                  - it was GORE!  Hanging right
                  there like a runny nose!!

61.    INTERIOR DOTTIE HINKLE'S LIVING ROOM.

       DET. BRADFORD and several other POLICE OFFICERS are
       taking her statement and trying to calm her down,

                            DOTTIE
                  Nice as pie she was to me and
                  then I hear her say it!

                            DET. BRADFORD
                  Say what, ma'am?

                            DOTTIE
                  "Are those..."
                       (Giving up)
                  I can't say the word out loud.

                            DET. BRADFORD
                     (Trying to comfort her)
                  Could you tell a policewoman
                  the exact words she used?
         
                            DOTTIE
                       (Being pitiful)
                  Maybe...

       A huge galute of a POLICEWOMAN sits next to DOTTIE
       and pats her hand.

                            POLICEWOMAN
                  It's ok...nobody's gonna
                  hurt you.
                       (Whispering)
                  Come on, let it out...

                            DOTTIE
                    (Yelling loudly, startling
                     all the cops in the room)
                  "PUSSY" she says to me!
                  "PUSSY WILLOWS!"

62.    INTERIOR SUTPHIN DINING ROOM.

                       (Excited, happy)
                  You know Mom, Scotty thinks
                  you're the killer!

       MISTY chokes on her food, DAD laughs unconvincingly.

                            MOM
                       (Laughs)
                  Does he?
                       (Smiling to CHIP)
                  For a boy who doesn't wear
                  seat belts, Scotty's awfully
                  nosy.
                       (Getting up)
                  Excuse me a second.
                       (Exits into kitchen)

       The whole family sits in awkward silence.

       ROOKIE COP sits in cop car on surveillance duty
       watching the Sutphin house in eery silence.

64.    SUTPHIN DINING ROOM.

       Family is squirming in their seats in nervous
       silence.  MISTY suddenly bolts from table and runs
       towards kitchen.

65.    SUTPHIN KITCHEN.

       MISTY runs in.  No one is there.  On blackboard,
       written in chalk is "WENT TO THE 7-il, MOM".

                            MISTY
                  She's gone!

       CHIP and DAD rush in.

                            MISTY
                       (Blurting it out)
                  She's gonna kill Scotty!

                            DAD
                       (No longer pretending)
                  BOTH OF YOU!  GET IN THE CAR!

                            CHIP
                       (Horrified)
                  DAD!  YOU DON'T THINK SHE
                  DID IT??!

                            MISTY
                  I DO!  Mom's gone crazy!

                            DAD
                       (To CHIP)
                  Your mother may have some
                  problems, that's all, Chip.

66.    EXTERIOR SUTPHINS.

       MOM peels out in her station wagon like a bat out of
       hell.

       ROOKIE COP looks up in shock, clumsily throws the
       car in gear and takes off behind her.  Subtitle
       appears "6:36pm" and then fades out.

67.    INTERIOR MOM'S STATION WAGON.

       MOM is driving like a lunatic,  She sees the red
       light of pursuing police car in rear-view mirror and
       floors it as she hits play button of tape deck in
       car and begins singing along loudly and scarily to
       her favorite song, Barry Manilow's "Daybreak",

                            MOM
                  "...Ain't no time to grieve
                  And it's Daybreak!!!
                  Let it shine, shine, shine,
                  All around the world!!"

68.    INTERIOR COP CAR.

       ROOKIE COP is sweating bullets speeding after MOM's
       car and grabs police radio.

                            ROOKIE
                  MAY DAY!! MAY DAY!!

69.    INTERIOR MOM'S CAR.

       MOM is "dancing" in place and gyrating to the beat
       as she belts out the finale of "Daybreak" and
       suddenly turns the steering wheel violently to the
       right.

70.    EXTERIOR MRS. HINKLE'S HOUSE.

       MOM's car veers across lawn and flattens Mrs.
       Hinkle's entire flower garden as she plows her way
       back to street.

       DET. BRADFORD comes running out of house and jumps
       out of way as ROOKIE COP's car skids around corner
       and smashes into Mrs. Ackerman's wishing well
       decoration in her front yard.

       DOTTIE HINKLE is held back by burly POLICEWOMAN on
       porch as she curses MOM in the distance.

                            DOTTIE
                  You rotten mother-fucker!

                  Turn right on Timonioum Road.
                  Hurry, Dad!

                            CHIP
                   (Scared for the first time)
                  If Mom's a psycho, Scotty will
                  still be ok, won't he?

                            DAD
                  We hope so, son.  And no matter
                  what your mother is, we'll love
                  her anyway.

73.    INTERIOR MOM'S CAR.

       MOM turns off tape player and pulls to a stop on a
       quiet suburban street.  She fixes her hair in rear
       view mirror, smiles, then takes out rubber
       dish-washing gloves and slips them on her hands.

74.    INTERIOR SCOTTY'S BEDROOM AT HIS PARENTS' HOUSE.

       SCOTTY lies in bed, surrounded by vintage
       sexploitation movie posters that decorate his walls
       ("Garden of Eden", "Mud-Honey", "There She Blows"),
       and watches on video the ridiculous 70's trash film
       "Double-Agent '73" starring Chesty Morgan.

       In the credit sequence he sees Miss Morgan
       "photographing" men with her humongous breasts that
       supposedly have cameras implanted inside.  SCOTTY is
       getting turned on.  He runs to lock bedroom door,
       closes curtain on window and then hops under a
       blanket to commit the sin of self-abuse.

75.    EXTERIOR SCOTTY'S PARENTS' HOUSE.

       DAD, MISTY and CHIP pull up, run to front door and
       pound on it.

       DETECTIVE MOORE pulls up at a safe distance behind
       them and watches from police car.  Subtitle appears
       "7:01pm" and disappears.

       SCOTTY is watching Chesty Morgan on video roll about
       in hideous hot pants and insane 1970's platform
       shoes as he concentrates on her gigantic breasts and
       touches himself off camera.  He hears banging at
       door, curses whoever it is, and decides to ignore
       them.

77.    EXTERIOR SCOTTY'S PARENTS' HOUSE.

       DAD jiggles the door unsuccessfully until CHIP
       slithers through an open window and lets MISTY and
       DAD inside.

                  Suspect's family is entering

                  Sycamore Street. I've got a
                  feeling old Mom's inside.  I'm
                  goin' in!

       Heroic music blares on soundtrack as he leaps from
       car and pulls gun.  Subtitle appears "7:24pm" and
       then fades out.

79.    CUT to MOM staring evily through plate glass window
       from outside a suburban house.

       Reverse angle shows not Scotty, but the dental
       emergency couple, THE STERNERS, as they sit in their
       dining room eating a dinner of cornish game hens.

       MOM zeros in on the game hens and flashes back to
       "Dede" and the other cute birds in her bird-feeder
       at home.

       As the couple viciously slice apart the game hens
       and stuff the meat in their mouths, MOM breaks a
       small pane of glass in back door to gain entry.

                            MRS. STERNER
                  What was that?

                            MR. STERNER
                  I didn't hear anything.
                  Got any dessert?

                            MRS. STERNER
                  Dr. Sutphin said no sweets
                  for you.

                            MR. STERNER
                  What's he know?

                            MRS. STERNER
                  How to send a bill!!

       They both laugh uproarously at her bad joke.

80.    STERNER KITCHEN.

       MOM is listening in disgust, notices a limp plant,
       waters it thoughtfully and then jumps out of the way
       to hide as MRS. STERNER comes into kitchen to get a
       large chocolate pie.

81.    INTERIOR SCOTTY'S BEDROOM.

       SCOTTY has the whole bed vibrating noisily as he
       watches Chesty Morgan on video in hideous green
       plaid bell bottoms as she "photographs" evidence
       with her breasts.

82.    INTERIOR SCOTTY'S PARENTS' HOUSE.  HALLWAY.

       DAD, MISTY and CHIP creep up the steps towards
       SCOTTY's bedroom.

83.    EXTERIOR SCOTTY'S PARENTS' HOUSE.

       DET. BRADFORD signals the newly arrived DET. MOORE
       and a small swat team in battle gear to follow him
       quietly to Scotty's front door.

84.    INTERIOR STERNER'S DINING ROOM.

       MR. STERNER cuts himself a second piece of chocolate
       pie and pigs it down.

85.    INTERIOR STERNER'S BEDROOM.

                            MRS. STERNER
                       (Yelling downstairs)
                  Ralph, "Wheel of Fortune"'s
                  on!!

       As MRS. STERNER continues to watch TV we see her get
       ready for bed.

       We see her change from her shoes to bedroom slippers
       from under the bed.

       We see her brush her hair from behind the mirror.

       We see her open her drawer and take out
       birth-control foam from inside the bureau.

       We see her go to closed curtains moving ominously in
       the breeze and close the window from the other side.

                            MRS. STERNER
                       (Calling out)
                  Ralph, you're missing it!

       MRS. STERNER takes off her dress to reveal monstrous
       white all-in-one bra and girdle and moves to closet
       door.

       She opens closet door and hesitates.

       We see shoe in bottom of closet move slightly.

       Suddenly a mouse scurries out of shoe and runs
       across floor as MRS. STERNER screams,

86.    STERNER DINING ROOM.

                            MR. STERNER
                    (As chocolate oozes in his
                     mouth)
                  What is it, Betty?

87.    STERNER BEDROOM.

                            MRS. STERNER
                       (Still shaking)
                  We have mice!  I mean it,
                  Ralph!  I saw one!

       MRS. STERNER reaches for nightgown and pulls it off
       hanger to reveal MOM's insane face.  Suddenly MOM
       stabs MRS. STERNER viciously in the stomach with
       MRS. ACKERMAN's scissors.

                            MOM
                       (Scarily)
                  Always brush after every meal!

       MRS. STERNER opens her mouth in a silent scream as
       MOM pulls out the scissors and stabs her again and
       again as a large rat in the closet runs out and
       begins biting MRS. STERNER's ankle at the same time.

88.    STERNER DINING ROOM.

       MR. STERNER burps in front of empty plate and hears
       loud thud from upstairs.  He gets up from table.

                            MR. STERNER
                       (Calling upstairs)
                  Betty?

89.    STERNER BEDROOM.

       MRS. STERNER is dead on the floor with scissors
       sticking out of her as MOM attempts to clean up the
       blood with the household product, "SHOUT".

90.    HALLWAY STERNER HOUSE.

       MR. STERNER runs up stairs, suddenly alarmed.

                            MR. STERNER
                  Betty?  Betty, answer me!

91.    STERNER BEDROOM

       MOM looks up from cleaning and smiles as MR. STERNER
       runs in, sees the grisly sight and screams in
       horror.

                            MOM
                     (Holding up bottle of "SHOUT"
                      and doing mock TV-ad)
                  "SHOUT IT OUT".

       MOM suddenly pulls scissors out of MRS. STERNER's
       stomach and expertly throws them like a knife at MR.
       STERNER's head.  He ducks in the nick of time and
       the scissors stick in the wall.

       MR. STERNER turns and runs in fear as MOM gives
       chase, grabbing the scissors out of the wall.

92.    HALLWAY.  STERNER HOUSE.

       MR. STERNER runs down the steps screaming as MOM
       runs after him.  She throws the scissors at him
       again, but just misses him.

       Thinking fast, MR. STERNER grabs scissors from wall
       and throws them back at MOM.  She ducks in the nick
       of time and her face goes purple with rage.

                            MOM
                  You'll pay for that, Ralph
                  Sterner!!

       As MR. STERNER runs to back door, MOM charges back
       up the steps to bedroom.

93.    STERNER BEDROOM.

       MOM rushes in and watches MR. STERNER from above
       from bedroom window as he runs out of house.

94.    STERNER LAWN.

       MR. STERNER runs across lawn screaming.

                            MR. STERNER
                  Help!  POLICE!!

95.    STERNER BEDROOM.

       MOM is rocking air conditioner in window back and
       forth until she gets it loose.  Seeing him right
       below, MOM shoves it out window with all her might.

96.    STERNER LAWN.

       MR. STERNER looks up at air conditioner falling from
       above and screams the second before he is crushed
       like an insect.

97.    SCOTTY'S BEDROOM.

       SCOTTY is moaning in orgasm as he watches ludicrous
       Chesty Morgan "Secret Agent" breast footage on video
       screen.

98.    OUTSIDE SCOTTY'S BEDROOM DOOR.

       DAD, MISTY and CHIP look at one another in horror
       thinking SCOTTY's moans are cries of pain and they
       break down his door to save him.

99.    SCOTTY'S BEDROOM.

       SCOTTY stares in complete mortification as the
       Sutphin family catch him in the middle of an orgasm.

       When DETECTIVES MOORE and BRADFORD and their
       ridiculously overprepared SWAT TEAM flood the
       bedroom, screaming "FREEZE" and "HANDS OVER YOUR
       HEAD", SCOTTY fumes in anger as MISTY and CHIP
       giggle in relief and DAD turns red in embarrassment.

100.   Wipe to EXTERIOR SUTPHIN HOUSE.

       DAD's car pulls up and the relieved Sutphin family
       hops out and runs to house.  Subtitle appears
       "9:02pm" and fades out.

                            DAD
                  Home Sweet Home!  Everything's
                  fine, kids!

                            MISTY
                       (Laughing)
                  I can't believe I thought my
                  own mother was a murderess!

                            CHIP
                  I'm disappointed she isn't!
                       (In wonder)
                  For a while there, it was like
                  being in a movie!

101.   SUTPHIN DINING ROOM.

       MOM is seated happily at table.  DAD, MISTY and CHIP
       enter.

                            MOM
                       (Beaming happily)
                  Anybody for dessert?
                  M-m-m-m-m, strawberries!

       Fade to black.

102.   Fade in to ST. TIMOTHY'S EPISCOPAL CHURCH.

       Sign out front announces the service: "11:00am.
       Holy Eucharist Service.  Sermon: 'Capitol Punishment
       and You'".  Families stream into church.  Subtitle
       appears "10:37am, Sunday September 20th" and fades
       out.

103.   EXTERIOR SUTPHIN HOUSE.

       MOM, DAD, CHIP and MISTY walk out front door dressed
       in their Sunday finest.  Suddenly their wholesome
       smiles freeze on their faces.

       Cop cars are everywhere watching MOM's every move.
       DETECTIVES MOORE and BRADFORD smile hatefully at
       MOM, pressuring her with their high-visibility
       surveillance.

       The family nervously gets in their car and DAD turns
       the ignition.

       Cop after cop after cop start up their engines.

       As DAD pulls out of the driveway in his car the cops
       file into a procession of intimidation behind him.

104.   INTERIOR DET. MOORE AND DET. BRADFORDS' CAR.

                            DET. BRADFORD
                       (Talking into police radio)
                  ...Sutphin family proceeding west
                  on Seminary Avenue.  Beverly ain't
                  goin' nowhere this time.

                            MISTY
                       (Scared)
                  Dad, I thought it was ok.
                  Make them go away.  This is
                  embarrassing.

                            DAD
                  Just ignore the police.
                  It's all a terrible mistake.

       He turns on radio to music.

                            CHIP
                  Think we'll get on "A
                  CURRENT AFFAIR"?

106.   INTERIOR DET. MOORE AND BRADFORD'S CAR.

                            DET. MOORE
                  She's headed for church.

                            DET. BRADFORD

                  book with those on scissors and
                  fire poker.

                       (To DET. MOORE)
                  She may be Beaver Cleaver's

                  entire People's Temple just
                  fucked her!

107.   INTERIOR SUTPHIN CAR.

       MISTY, CHIP and DAD listen in appalled silence to
       news report on radio as MOM seems unfazed.

                            ANNOUNCER
                  ...the senseless killing last
                  night of Towson couple, Ralph
                  and Betty Sterner, brings to a
                  total of four murders police
                  feel may have been committed by
                  Baltimore's first serial killer...

       DAD looks at MOM in stunned disbelief.

                            DAD
                  Beverly!  Not the Sterners!

                            MOM
                       (Calmly)
                  It's a shame.  But they should
                  brush their teeth, honey.

                            ANNOUNCER
                       (On radio)
                  This just came in.  Police
                  Lieutenant Ronald Habbler has
                  publicly named a suspect in the
                  serial killer case and it's a
                  shocker!  She, that's right, she
                  has been identified as Beverly R.
                  Sutphin of 2815 Calverton Court...

                            MISTY
                  Oh God!
                       (In despair)
                  Now I'll never get a boyfriend!

                            DAD
                       (Nervously)
                  Beverly, I've been reading all
                  about it...is it menopause?

                            MOM
                  Oh, honey!

                            CHIP
                  Tell me the truth, Mom!
                  It's ok with me, really!  Are
                  you a serial killer?

                            MOM
                  Chip, the only cereal I know
                  about is Rice Krispies.

       Sutphin car pulls to a stop at a red light next to
       car full of churchgoers.  MOM turns to smile at them
       and all the churchgoers scream in horror at the
       sight of her face.

                            DAD
                       (Lovingly, painfully)
                  Don't worry, Beverly.  We're
                  going to get you good psychiatric
                  help.

108.   EXTERIOR ST. TIMOTHY'S EPISCOPAL CHURCH.

       MRS. ACKERMAN and MRS. HINKLE look up in amazement
       as they see the Sutphins pull into church parking
       lot followed by string of police cars.

       The Sutphins nervously get out of car and walk
       towards church as the good Christian families glare
       at them and gossip with a vengeance.

       DAD tries to be brave, MISTY hangs her head in
       mortification, CHIP is excited by all the attention
       and MOM smiles happily to appalled worshippers.

       GUS and SLOPPY, the two garbagemen, dressed in their
       shabby church clothes wave to MOM in secret
       admiration.

       BIRDIE's eyes light up at seeing CHIP but her
       suddenly forbidding parents hold her back when she
       tries to join him.  She mouths "I love you" to him
       as CHIP looks back to her parents with hurt and
       confusion.

       As the SUTPHIN family reaches the church door, a
       reporter runs towards them with his cameras drawn.

                            REPORTER
                       (To MOM)
                  So, Mrs. Sutphin!  Tell me!
                  Are you "Serial Mom"?

                            MOM
                  Who?

                            DAD
                   (Blocking his face from
                    strobing flash)
                  No comment!

                            CHIP
                      (To himself)
                  "Serial Mom"?
                   (He looks at his MOM who is
                    perversely enjoying the
                    attention)
                  WOW!

       MISTY, who can't help but notice that the REPORTER
       is strikingly handsome, gives him an obviously
       flirtatious smile before DAD yanks her into church
       with the rest of them.

109.   INTERIOR ST. TIMOTHY'S CHURCH.

       FATHER STONE, a mild and kind looking Episcopal
       priest has just begun the service.

                            FATHER STONE
                       (On altar)
                  Blessed be God, Father, Son and
                  Holy Spirit...

                            ALL
                  And blessed be His kingdom, now
                  and forever.  Amen...

       The SUTPHINS take their place in a half filled pew
       next to appalled young MARRIED COUPLE as a still
       mortified SCOTTY glares in hatred and vengeance from
       a pew in the back of the church.

       BIRDIE's face is covered in tears as she sits with
       her parents helplessly.

       MISTY turns in her seat and searches the hostile
       crowd for the face of the cute REPORTER.  When she
       spots him secretly snapping her photo, she subtly
       gives him a sexy pose.

110.   EXTERIOR CHURCH.

       DETECTIVES MOORE and BRADFORD wait with other COPS
       outside their cars as voice comes over police radio.

                            CAPTAIN JOHNSON
                  This is Captain Johnson from
                  Homicide.  Lab reports confirm
                  Sutphin latent print of index
                  finger on true-crime book matches
                  those latent prints lifted from
                  murder weapons.  Bingo, boys!
                  Bust the bitch!
         
       COPS smile in silent victory as they immediately
       spread out and approach the church.

111.   INTERIOR CHURCH.

       FATHER STONE is giving the sermon in a kindly tone.

                            FATHER STONE
                  ...Jesus said nothing to condemn
                  capital punishment as he hung on
                  the cross, did He?!

       MRS. ACKERMAN and MRS. HINKLE nod in pious
       agreement.

                            FATHER STONE
                  ...If ever there was a time to
                  go on record against the death
                  penalty, WASN'T IT THAT NIGHT?!...

       DAD gulps and lovingly takes MOM's hand as MISTY and
       CHIP look at one another appalled while MOM
       continues her defiant smile.

                            FATHER STONE
                  CAPITAL PUNISHMENT is already the
                  LAW in the State of Maryland!...

       DETECTIVES MOORE and BRADFORD and all the COPS begin
       infiltrating the church, taking places in pews and
       then moving forward to other pews closer to MOM.

       SCOTTY beams at police presence and eagerly scoots
       over to let DET. BRADFORD and DET. MOORE sit with
       him on their way to nail MOM.

       GUS and SLOPPY, the garbagemen, scowl at the police
       and look with loyalty to poor MOM.

                            FATHER STONE
                  ...SO WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR,
                  FELLOW CHRISTIANS?!  LET'S JUST
                  DO IT!!

                            ALL
                  AMEN!

                            FATHER STONE
                  Now, let us pray and humbly
                  confess our sins unto Almighty
                  God.

       As CONGREGATION prays along with FATHER STONE, COPS
       flood the church and move towards MOM.

                            CONGREGATION
                  ...Most merciful God, we confess
                  that we have sinned against thee...

                            CHIP and MISTY
                  ...by what we have done...

                            BIRDIE & PARENTS
                  ...and by what we have left undone...

                            DAD
                  ...we are truly sorry and we
                  humbly repent...

                            MOM
                   (Praying piously, but beginning
                     to sniffle a sneeze)
                  ...so that we may delight in thy
                  will...

       A BABY in the arms of a MOTHER in pew in front of
       MOM stares back at MOM.

                            MOM
                  ...And walk in the ways to
                  the glory...
                   (Starts to sneeze and
                    catches herself)
                  ...of Thy name...

                            ALL
                  Amen!

       MOM sneezes and a hunk of phlegm flies out and hits
       BABY square in face.

       BABY'S MOTHER screams in horror at seeing her BABY's
       face and the entire congregation1 thinking she's
       been attacked by MOM, dives to the floor in terror.

       COPS draw guns and leap over pews as complete
       pandemonium breaks out in church.

       Just as DET. MOORE and DET. BRADFORD are about to
       grab MOM, GUS and SLOPPY punch the COPS in the mouth
       and MOM runs off.

       DAD looks for MOM in a panic and realizes she has
       vanished.

       CHIP cringes in fear as hordes of COPS surround his
       family until he is relieved to see that MOM has
       escaped.

       MISTY gives "dramatic" poses of "fear" and "horror"
       as cute REPORTER snaps her picture excitedly.

       BIRDIE escapes her parents, runs to CHIP, embraces
       him and together they take off.

       FATHER STONE stares out from altar in shock as
       worshippers scream and trample each other trying to
       get out of church as police try to restore order.

       SCOTTY, trying to be macho, fights his way towards
       front of church and for a split-second sees CHIP,
       BIRDIE and MOM running out back door of sacristy in
       escape.

                            SCOTTY
                  THERE SHE IS!!

       MOM blows a quick kiss to GUS and SLOPPY who beam in
       happiness at helping her escape.

112.   EXTERIOR CHURCH PARKING LOT.

       CHIP and BIRDIE are "hot-wiring" SCOTTY's car as MOM
       lies hidden out of view on back seat of car.

113.   INTERIOR SCOTTY'S CAR.

                            CHIP
                  We'll show 'em, Mom,  We'll
                  go on "60 Minutes"!

       The car engine starts up.

                            BIRDIE
                  Alright
                       (To MOM)
                  You're bigger than Jason or
                  Freddie now!
                      (In wonderment)
                  Only you're a real person!

                            MOM
                       (Innocently)
                  Do you think I'll need
                  a lawyer?

                            CHIP
                     (Putting on his seat belt)
                  You need an AGENT!

       CHIP peels out.

114.   EXTERIOR CHURCH PARKING LOT.

       REPORTER has chased DAD and MISTY to their car,
       still taking pictures as COPS flood the area looking
       for MOM.

                            DAD
                  NO COMMENT!  PLEASE!  My
                  wife is missing!  I'm worried
                  sick about her!

115.   EXTERIOR "SUBURBAN CULT VIDEO" SHOP.

       CHIP and BIRDIE hurry MOM from car and run to door
       of shop as CHIP fumbles for his keys to open up.

116.   INTERIOR "SUBURBAN CULT VIDEO" SHOP.

       CHIP and BIRDIE hustle MOM into the shop and lead
       her to the "Gore" section and open a door covered
       with violent video display boxes to reveal a small
       closet.

                            CHIP
                  In here, Mom...

                            MOM
                  But, Chip...

       CUSTOMER begins banging on door.

                            CHIP
                  Get in, Mom!  I have to open.

                            MOM
                  This is so silly.
                       (Gets in)

       CHIP closes door behind her and then inserts
       cassette into VCR and pushes "Play" button.  On
       video in shop we see "Leatherface" in "The Texas
       Chainsaw Massacre" jump out from behind a bush and
       hack up a male victim.

       BIRDIE lets in the first customer of the day, a
       middle aged battle-ax, MRS. JENSON.

                            BIRDIE
                  Good morning, Mrs. Jenson.

                     door as the victim screams
                     in terror)
                  Haven't you had enough
                  violence, Chip Sutphin?
                  Turn that filth off!

                            CHIP
                       (Turning it off)
                  Sorry, ma'am.

                            MRS. JENSON
                  Do you have the musical,
                  "Annie"?

                    (Rolling his eyes and
                     getting the cassette)
                  Sure do.  Did you bring
                  back "Ghost Dad"?

                            MRS. JENSON
                   (Rooting in her purse and
                    handing CHIP the casette)
                  There you go.  I love Bill

                   (Looking at cassette in
                      frustration)
                  Mrs. Jensen, I've told you.
                  You have to rewind the tapes
                  before returning them!

                       (Defiantly)
                  I don't feel like rewinding it!

       MOM's face turns to stone in closet.

                            CHIP
                       (Exasperated)
                  You see the sign!  It's a
                  dollar fine for not rewinding
                  and this time I'm gonna charge
                  you! $2.99 plus one dollar
                  is $3.99!

                  Keep the change, you son of
                  a psycho!

       MRS. JENSON stomps to door and slams it behind her
       as MOM's face twists in rage as she listens.

                            BIRDIE

117.   EXTERIOR "SUBURBAN CULT VIDEO" SHOP.

       CHIP and BIRDIE exit in a panic and run up the
       street.

       Hidden behind his "borrowed" car across the street
       is SCOTTY who has been watching them all along.  He
       takes off on foot after them.

118.   INTERIOR MRS. JENSON'S KITCHEN.

       A carving knife slices through leg-of-lamb on
       kitchen table.  Camera pans up to MRS. JENSON's
       happy face as she fixes herself a leg-of-lamb
       sandwich and exits to living room.

119.   INTERIOR MRS. JENSON'S LIVING ROOM.

       MRS. JENSON kicks off her shoes, excitedly pops
       videocassette into her VCR and climbs into her
       recliner for a relaxing afternoon of video
       pleasures.  She takes a big bite out of her
       sandwich, twangs the remote to start the video and
       smiles excitedly at hearing the overture to
       "Tomorrow" begin over the credit sequence to
       "Annie", her favorite musical.  Subtitle appears
       "12:09pm" and fades out.

120.   INTERIOR MRS. JENSON'S KITCHEN.

       The door handle jiggles ominously.

121.   INTERIOR MRS. JENSON'S LIVING ROOM.

       A large DOG rises up next to MRS. JENSON.

                  What is it, Sylvester,
                  a bird?  Shhhh.  Mommy's
                  watching "Annie".

122.   INTERIOR MRS'. JENSON'S KITCHEN.

       MOM looks over her shoulder to make sure no one is
       watching and then slowly lets herself in kitchen
       door.  Her eyes immediately go to gleaming butcher
       knife on table.

123.   INTERIOR MRS. JENSON'S LIVING ROOM.

       The DOG growls.

                            MRS. JENSON
                  Quiet, Sylvester.  Nobody's

                       (To BIRDIE)

       They sneak to side of house.

       Cut to SCOTTY watching them from a distance.

125.   INTERIOR JENSON KITCHEN.

       MOM is down on floor with mean DOG getting him to

       SCOTTY looks horrified to see a figure sneaking up

       SCOTTY sighs in relief.

       BIRDIE gives CHIP a leg-up and he gets a glimpse of
       the singing MRS. JENSON building to the finale of

                   I love you..."

135.   JENSON KITCHEN.

       MOM picks up entire leg-of-lamb by the bone as her
       eyes light up in homicidal glee.  She leans down,
       kisses the DOG on the lips, and exits back to living
       room.

136.   INTERIOR JENSON LIVING ROOM.

       MRS. JENSON is practically leaping our of her
       recliner singing along with the finale to "Tomorrow"
       on the credits to "Annie" as MOM creeps up behind
       her with leg-of-lamb.

                            MRS. JENSON
                  "....Tomorrow!
                  You're only a day...
                  AWAAAAAY!!!"

       MOM bludgeons MRS. JENSON with the leg-of-lamb on
       the final note of the song.

       Blood splatters the happy scene on the TV screen.
       MRS. JENSON tries to struggle up from the floor but
       MOM hits her over the head again with leg-of-lamb
       and finishes her off.

       MOM zaps the off button and softly sings to herself
       in the sudden silence.

                  "Tomorrow!..Tomorrow!..Tomorrow!
                  I love you...

       MOM bludgeons her one more time and then pushes the
       REWIND button in revenge.

       BIRDIE screams in horror and falls to the ground.

                            BIRDIE
                  I saw blood!  And it's brown!
                  Not red like in horror movies,
                  but brown!!

                            CHIP
                       (Terrified)
                  Is MOM...in there?

                            BIRDIE
                  No!
                       (Obsessed)
                  It wasn't like gore movies

                  Oh God, I think I'm going
                  to be sick...

       BIRDIE vomits into the hot coals of somebody's
       outside cooking grill as horrified HOUSEWIFE looks

       MOM plunges butcher knife through convertible top as
       he puts key in ignition.

       A van pulls to a stop.  Inside are two BURGLARS;
       one white, the other black.  They are surrounded by
       obvious loot: VCR's, cameras and silverware.

       MOM turns to them with knife.

                            BURGLAR A
                  What the fuck is that?

                            BURGLAR B
                  Betty Crocker gone psycho!

       MOM yanks open van door and points knife inside.

                            MOM
                       (Primly)
                  Give me your fucking van
                  before I kill you!

                       (Hopping out of driver's
                        seat)
                  Yes, ma'am.  It's all yours.

                            BURGLAR B
                       (Hopping out as MOM
                        hops in and pulls off)
                  Drive carefully!
                       (To fellow BURGLAR A)
                  White people sure are something!

148.   INTERIOR SCOTTY'S CAR.

       SCOTTY is speeding along, relieved to get away.

                  Dear God...I promise I'll

                  Oh shit!
                       (He floors it)

151.   SUBURBAN INTERSECTION.

       CHIP and BIRDIE are running down street.

       DAD and MISTY are driving in other direction looking
       for MOM.  Seeing CHIP and BIRDIE, DAD screeches on
       the brakes and the kids run to car in relief and
       jump in.

       Suddenly SCOTTY roars by in his car with MOM in hot
       pursuit.  She sees DAD and family and blows them a
       lunatic kiss.

                            DAD
                  Hold on, kids!

       DAD takes off after MOM in car.

       A COP sees the speeding caravan as it careens around
       a corner.

                            COP
                  All units!  SERIAL MOM
                  headed south on York Road.

       SCOTTY careens into parking lot in his convertible.
       Subtitle appears "2:47pm" and fades out.

153.   INTERIOR HAMMERJACKS.

       On stage, "CAMEL LIPS", an all-female
       grunge-punk-metal band, dressed in their trademark
       skin tight slacks that gave the group their name,
       perform their hit song "Gas Chamber".  The monstrous
       but beautiful LEAD SINGER bellows and snarls the
       lyrics as the DRUMMER, a brain dead drug idiot, hits
       herself on head with drumstick in between beats as
       criminal looking biker-chick GUITARIST plays her
       instrument and mock-humps it with sexual abandon.

       The audience of on-the-edge kids goes bezerk,
       guzzling beer and slam dancing with frightening
       intensity

154.   EXTERIOR HAMMERJACKS.

       MOM speeds into parking lot.

       SCOTTY is looking over his shoulder in fear as he
       nears the entrance waiting in line with grunge-metal
       kids.

                            DOORMAN
                       (To SCOTTY)
                  I.D.?

                            SCOTTY
                       (Panicked)
                  Can I give it to you inside?

                            DOORMAN
                  Hey, buddy.  NOBODY gets
                  inside without I.D.

       SCOTTY fumbles for his wallet.

       MOM is hurrying across parking lot staring at SCOTTY
       with a vengeance.

       DAD and the kids speed into parking lot and jump out
       of car.

                            DOORMAN
                       (Looking at Scotty's I.D.)
                  Birthdate?

                            SCOTTY
                    (Straining to remember
                     information on his fake I.D.)
                  Uh...December 14th, 1975.
                       (Pleading)
                  Please!

                            DOORHAN
                  Ok, go ahead,

       SCOTTY snatches back I.D. and rushes inside.

       As horde of cop cars with lights blinking and sirens
       blaring screech into parking lot, MOM pushes her way
       up in line and greets startled kids who recognize
       her.

                            MOM
                  Hi! I know your mom...

                            KID A
                  It's her!

                            KID B
                  Who?

                            MOM
                  Excuse me.
                   (Pushing her way up in line)
                  Age before beauty...

                            KID C
                  The murder lady!  The one
                  on TV!

                            KID B
                  Cool!  Is she in a band?

                            MOM
                       (Butting ahead)
                  Sorry...the police are after
                  me...

                            DOORMAN
                       (Recognizing her)
                  Hey, you're Serial Mom!

                            MOM
                       (Modestly)
                  I guess I am.

                            DOORMAN
                   (Looks up and sees her family
                    and COPS rushing towards her)

                  Welcome to Hammerjacks,
                  "Serial Mom"!

                            MOM
                  Thank you so much, you kind,
                  kind creature.

155.   INTERIOR HAMMERJACKS.

       A parents' nightmare.  Grunge-punk hell.  "CAMEL
       LIPS" is undulating suggestively on stage screeching
       out the chorus of "Gas Chamber" as they mock gasp
       for breath, dodge beer bottles thrown from audience
       and punch out male groupies who rush the stage past
       brutish bouncers.

       SCOTTY pushes his way through slam dancing crowd as
       he is picked up and bodily tossed through the air by
       frenzied mob of "body-surfing" dancers.

       MOM is racing to catch up with SCOTTY.

                            MOM
                  Excuse me...coming through...
                     (Snatches beer bottle
                      out of boy's hand)
                  Bill Flowers!  You're underage!

                            BILL
                       (Laughing)
                  Don't kill me, Serial Mom!

                            MOM
                    (Snatching joint out of
                     hophead girl's lips)
                  Just say NO!  And COMB YOUR
                  HAIR, young lady!

                            GIRL
                       (Stoned)
                  Wow!  It's her!
                       (Proudly)
                  AND SHE'S A HEAVY METAL
                  MANIAC!!!

       DAD looks horrified as he politely maneuvers his way
       through crowd as CHIP, MISTY and BIRDIE take over
       and begin "slamming" their way through crowd opening
       up a crowd for DAD.

       The COPS flood the place.  DET. MOORE sees MOM in
       the distance, grabs DET. BRADFORD and they begin to
       fight their way through crowd after her.

       "CAMEL LIPS" incites the crowd from the stage to
       fight back against the police.

       SCOTTY is running toward stage in terror, looking
       over his shoulder and seeing MOM gaining on him.

       DAD gets caught in a mob of slam dancers and is
       lifted off his feet and tossed through the air by
       the crowd.

       MISTY, CHIP and BIRDIE see DAD airborne and start
       slamming into the crowd to save him.  MISTY and CHIP
       slam into big BIKER below DAD and DAD is knocked
       back to the ground safely.

       When BIRDIE sees a slam dancer with a trickle of
       blood running from his nose, she starts gagging at
       the sight of real blood.

       SCOTTY is at the edge of the stage.  He sees MOM
       almost on top of him and leaps onto stage and runs
       for his life, dodging bouncers and beer bottles
       being thrown from audience.

       MOM looks furious that SCOTTY has escaped but then
       looks up at theatrical light rigging overhead and
       then back down at SCOTTY's face as "CAMEL LIPS"
       tries to hit him with their instruments.  MOM looks
       over her shoulder and sees DET. MOORE and DET.
       BRADFORD advancing on her.  Ducking behind a giant
       speaker, out of view of the crowd MOM pulls butcher
       knife from purse, cuts supporting rope and sends
       whole set of lights crashing down on SCOTTY's head.

       The crowd goes wild thinking it's more of "CAMEL
       LIPS" sickening theatrics.

       A gang of heavy-metal chicks slam into DET. MOORE
       and DET. BRADFORD and knock them to the ground.

       MOM's eyes light up in fury when she sees SCOTTY
       still alive, crawling out from under the lights,
       semi-conscious and bleeding.

       BIRDIE faints at the sight of more blood.

       Thinking fast, MOM swipes a hairspray can sticking
       out of a girl's purse and uses her VIP pass to go
       backstage as CAMEL LIPS reaches its deafening
       crescendo of musical mayhem.

       As SCOTTY crawls to side of stage, MOM jumps out
       from a piece of backstage scenery and aims hairspray
       can at him.

                            MOM
                       (Hissing)
                  Buckle up, Scotty!

       MOM lights the spray from the hairspray can and
       ignites SCOTTY's clothes in lethal flames without
       anyone seeing her.

       SCOTTY runs across the stage ablaze as "CAMEL LIPS"
       plays the final deafening note of their song and the
       crowd gives a screaming ovation, all holding up lit
       lighters, thinking SCOTTY on fire is all part of the
       act.

       DET. MOORE and DET. BRADFORD look to the stage in
       horror.

       DAD gasps in fear.  MISTY and CHIP stare speechless
       as SCOTTY falls to his knees and keels over.  BIRDIE
       comes to and then faints again.

       The LEAD SINGER thinks it's a joke, pours a little
       Jack Daniels on the smouldering corpse and then
       jumps back in comic over-reaction when the flames
       light up again.

       MOM, now caught in the front row of laughing
       slam-dancing spectators, turns to her dumb-struck
       family, smiles and sticks fingers in her ears,
       mimicking that the music is much too loud.

       DET. MOORE and DET. BRADFORD slamdance MOM from both
       sides and knock her to the ground and handcuff her.

       DAD puts his arms around CHIP, MISTY and BIRDIE as
       they hang their heads in sorrow.

       "CAMEL LIPS" and the entire audience of grunge-punks
       boo and jeer the police as they drag MOM out as she
       smiles innocently in suburban lunacy.

       covered in peace signs.  CHIP, on the other hand,
       looks cooler, wears L.A. styled outfit and carries

                            WIFE A
                    (Getting into the act)
                  ..Manson.. .Watergate...
                       (To Lady A)
                  Didn't I see you at Hinkley?

                            LADY A
                       (Proudly)
                  I was there!  My husband
                  thought I was crazy but...
                    (Seeing Sutphin family
                     getting off elevator)
                  LOOK!  HERE THEY COME!!
                  That awful family!

       The hostile crowd starts craning their necks and
       screaming in recognition as if rock stars are making
       their entrance.  DAD is blinded by the press's
       flashbulbs as HERBIE HEBDEN tries to stop CHIP from
       signing autographs as BIRDIE hands out "Stop the
       Violence" handbills.  REPORTER BOYFRIEND gives MISTY
       the signal and she starts crying for his exclusive
       news shots.

159.   INTERIOR COURTROOM.

       Packed with spectators, press and security officers.
       The middle-class jury of seven woman and five men
       take their place in the jury box as Sutphin family
       take their seats in front row behind HERBIE HEBDEN
       at his defense table.

       TIMOTHY NAZLEROD, the prosecutor, studies evidence
       photos of victim's bodies at the District Attorney's
       table on other side of the courtroom.  He looks up
       in disgust as MOM makes her apple-pie entrance.
       Escorted by two stern-faced police matrons.
       Subtitle appears "10:00am" and fades out.

                            MOM
                     (Happily waving to DAD)
                  Hi, honey!

       DAD smiles back pitifully.

                            MOM
                     (To CHIP, BIRDIE & MISTY)
                  Kids, did you do your homework?

       They give her a weak smile and nod "Yes".

                            JUDGE
                  Quiet in the courtroom! Court
                  is now in session!

                            MOM
                       (To JURY)
                  Hello, jury people.
                  My name's Beverly Sutphin.
                   (To startled woman juror)
                  I like your jacket!

                            JUDGE
                       (Losing patience)
                  Mrs. Sutphin, I SAID QUIET!
                  You are accused of mass murder!
                  This is a court of law, not
                  a coffee klatch!
                       (Bangs gavel)
                  Mr. Nazlerod, your opening
                  statement.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Thank you, your honor.
                       (Approaches JURY)
                  Ladies and Gentlemen of the
                  Jury, my name is Timothy
                  Nazlerod...
                       (Smarmily)
                  ...and I hope we can be
                  friends!
                    (JURY stares back
                     impartially)
                  ...I warn you, this is not a
                  pretty case...Beverly Sutphin
                  is a woman evil to the core...
                   (JURY POV shot of innocent-
                    looking MOM staring back
                    at them)
                  ...a rotten apple, if you will...
                    (DAD gulps in sorrow)
                  ...who beyond a reasonable
                  doubt killed five innocent
                  people!!

       SPECTATORS scowl hatefully at MOM.

                            CHIP
                     (Whispering to BIRDIE,
                      making excuses)
                  Well...they sort of deserved it...

       BIRDIE pales over the mere thought of violence.

                            DAD
                       (To CHIP)
                  Shhhhh!

       He looks over and sees MISTY and REPORTER BOYFRIEND
       are holding hands and glares at them to stop.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  ...THAT'S RIGHT!  SHE MURDERED
                  THEM!...WITH A SPEEDING CAR...
                  A FIRE POKER...

       MOM subtly motions to MALE JUROR that he has
       something in his nose.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  ...A PAIR OF SCISSORS...

       JUROR self-consciously feels around his nostrils in
       embarrassment.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  ...A TOPPLED AIR CONDITIONER!

       MOM signals to JUROR that the problem is still
       there.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  ...THE LETHAL FLAMES FROM AN
                  AEROSOL CAN...EVEN A LEG OF
                  LAMB!!

       JUROR blows his nose.  MOM smiles happily to him
       that the problem is solved.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  ...Beverly Sutphin is not a
                  woman!...

       MISTY and REPORTER are watching and move even closer
       together to snuggle.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  ...SHE IS A MONSTER!!

       MOM's smile turns to horror as JUROR #8 on end of
       second row crosses her legs and MOM zeros in on her
       hideous white summer shoes.

       Wipe to a disheveled HERBIE HEBDEN, the ultimate
       liberal defense attorney, as he paces back and forth
       before JURY wiping his brow.

                            HERBIE HEBDEN
                  ...Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm
                  Herbie Hebden and you and I
                  have a tough job ahead of us...

       MOM is still staring insanely at JUROR1s shoes.

                            HERBIE HEBDEN
                  ...I have known the Sutphin
                  family for sixteen years...

       MOM is frantically scribbling a note to her attorney
       on a legal pad.

                            HERBIE HEBDEN
                  ...Dad, Eugene, is my dentist...

       DAD self-consciously smiles to JURORS.

                            HERBIE HEBDEN
                  ...Chip and Misty played with
                  my own children...

       CHIP smiles to MOM's few heavymetal supporters as
       REPORTER BOYFRIEND puts his arm around MISTY.

                            HERBIE HEBDEN
                  ...but I've found out I don't
                  know Beverly Sutphin at all!

       He is trying to ignore MOM as she passes him a note
       that says "Juror #8 is wearing white summer shoes!"

                            HERBIE HEBDEN
                  ...No one really knows Beverly
                  Sutphin...

       MOM writes angrily "AFTER LABOR DAY!!"

                            HERBIE HEBDEN
                  ...You see...
                    (He reads note to humor MOM)
                  ...Beverly Sutphin is INSANE!!

                            MOM
                       (Suddenly defiant)
                  I AM NOT!

       Courtroom spectators gasp as DAD's mouth falls open.

                            HERBIE HEBDEN
                     (Trying to make his point)
                  Yes, she committed these
                  terrible crimes...
                       (Pleading)
                  ...but that doesn't make her
                  a bad person.

                            MOM
                       (Standing)
                  Your honor, I have a motion.
                  I would like to fire my
                  attorney, and defend myself!

       Sutphin family looks at one another, shocked at
       MOM's change of plans.

                            HERBIE HEBDEN
                  Beverly Sutphin is not guilty,
                  by reason of INSANITY!

                            MOM
                  Oh shut up, Herbie!
                       (To JUDGE)
                  I have the right to defend myself,
                  your honor.  I've read the
                  lawbooks!  "Ware vs. State, 1964",
                  and "Schutte vs. State, 1962".

                            JUDGE
                  Mrs. Sutphin, a defendant
                  who has herself for a lawyer
                  has a fool for a client...
                       (To attorneys)
                  Approach the bench!

       MOM smiles at DAD who looks bewildered as CHIP,
       MISTY and REPORTER BOYFRIEND give MOM the thumbs-up
       sign as BIRDIE nervously flashes her the peace sign.

                            JUDGE
                     (As bench conference
                      breaks up)
                  Mrs. Sutphin, I have no
                  legal choice but to allow
                  you to take over as your own
                  attorney.

       DAD looks worried and unsure.

                            HERBIE HEBDEN
                   (Sulking out of courtroom,
                    to MOM)
                  You'll get my bill, I mean
                  it!  A big one!

                            JUDGE
                       (To MOM)
                  How do you plead?

                            MOM
                       (Proudly)
                  NOT GUILTY, your honor!

       Courtroom and press buzz intently at MOM's new plea.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                       (Furious)
                  I call to the stand, Dottie
                  Hinkle!

       A vindictive and hostile, DOTTIE HINKLE enters the
       courtroom and eagerly takes the stand.  As she is
       sworn in, MOM watches her with an evil smile.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Mrs. Hinkle, did you ever
                  receive obscene telephone
                  calls?

                            DOTTIE
                       (Staring right at MOM)
                  I certainly did.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Did you recognize the voice
                  of the caller?

                            DOTTIE
                  Not at first, but then I
                  heard the same inflection in
                  a voice at a social gathering
                  and I put two and two together.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Who's voice was it, Dottie?

                            DOTTIE
                       (Pointing to MOM)
                  It was her!  Beverly Sutphin!
                  Sittin' right there!
                    (Dramatically to JURY)
                  I'm lucky I'm not DEAD!!

       Wipe to MOM approaching DOTTIE HINKLE for
       cross-examination.

                            MOM
                  Mrs. Hinkle...do you drink?

                            DOTTIE
                       (Haughtily)
                  No, I don't.

                            MOM
                  So you weren't drunk when
                  you received those alleged
                  obscene phonecalls?

                            DOTTIE
                  I certainly was not!

                            MOM
                  You mean to tell me the
                  day I came over to Mrs.
                  Ackerman's...the day you
                  claim you recognized my
                  voice...you weren't drinking?

                            DOTTIE
                       (Flustered)
                  One beer with lunch is
                  hardly "drinking".

       MISTY, CHIP and BIRDIE smile at MOM's legal skills.

                            MOM
                  So you do drink?

                            DOTTIE
                  Socially...I'll have a
                  beer.

                            MOM
                  So you admit you just
                  lied?

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Objection!  Argumentative!

                            DOTTIE
                       (Rising to the bait)
                  NO I DON'T, YOU BITCH!

                            JUDGE
                  Sustained.
                       (To DOTTIE)
                  Watch your mouth, Mrs.
                  Hinkle.

       Press scribbles frantically, beginning to doubt
       witness's credibility.

       MOM quickly and sneakily mouths "FUCK YOU" to DOTTIE
       without the JUDGE or anyone else in the courtroom
       besides DOTTIE seeing.

                            DOTTIE
                       (Shocked, to JUDGE)
                  Did you see her?!  She just
                  said "Fuck you" to me!

                             MOM
                        (Innocently, to JUDGE)
                  Let the record show I'm
                  just standing here.

                             DOTTIE
                  FUCK YOU TOO, YOU WHORE!

                             JUDGE
                  I'm warning you, Mrs. Hinkle.
                  One more obscenity and I'll
                  charge you with contempt of
                  court.

       DAD watches, amazed at his wife's cunning.

                            MOM
                       (Dramatically)
                  Mrs. Hinkle, are you insane?

                            DOTTIE
                  NO I'M NOT, YOU MOTHER-FUCKER!

       Police matrons lunge at DOTTIE as she leaps from
       witness box to attack MOM.

                            JUDGE
                       (Bangs gavel)
                  Mrs. Hinkle, I find you
                  guilty of contempt of
                  court and sentence you to
                  a thousand dollar fine and
                  five days in jail!

                    (To MOM, being dragged
                     out)
                  YOU COCK-SUCKER!  YOU LOUSY
                  PIG-FUCKER!

       MOM smiles at JURY and turns to wink at her amazed
       family as spectators watch, willing to give MOM, for
       the first time, the benefit of the doubt.

       Fade out.

160.   Fade in to COURTROOM HALLWAY.  MORNING.

       CHIP is pacing up and down yelling into a mobile
       phone outside MOM's trial as long line of spectators
       wait to get in.  Subtitle appears "Tuesday, January
       19th, 10:05am" and then fades out.

                            CHIP
                       (On phone)
                  ...Well, you tell "Geraldo" to
                  go to hell!  I don't care what
                  Jeffrey MacDonald's people got
                  - he's old news!  We fly first
                  class or we don't do the show!

       A YOUNG MAN angrily approaches CHIP.
         
                            YOUNG MAN
                  Are you Chip Sutphin?

                            CHIP
                       (Into phone)
                  Hold on...
                       (To YOUNG MAN)
                  Yeah I am, but you'll have
                  to speak to my agent...

                            YOUNG MAN
                  Your mom killed my brother!

       He punches CHIP in the mouth.

                            CHIP
                       (Getting up, rubbing
                        his jaw)
                  That's cool...hey look, you're
                  Carl's brother, right?

                            YOUNG MAN
                  That's right.

                            CHIP
                  I'm sorry he's dead, but...
                  have you signed off yet?

                            YOUNG MAN
                    (Suddenly all business)
                  You mean for TV or print?

                            CHIP
                  TV, man!  Farrah Fawcett's
                  interested in playing my
                  mother!

                            YOUNG MAN
                   (Impressed, eyes lighting up)
                  Farrah Fawcett?!  Who's gonna
                  play my brother?  Is Jason
                  Priestly available?

       LU-ANN HODGES, pot-head witness from PTA murder is
       on the stand testifying for the prosecution.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Miss Hodges, could you describe
                  the car...the one you saw run
                  over Mr. Stubbins in cold blood?

                            LU-ANN
                       (Giggling)
                  I seen that movie!...On cable!

       MOM stares in shock at JUROR #8 who has the nerve to
       give MOM a friendly smile back while wearing yet
       another hideous pair of white summer shoes.  Trying
       to suppress her rage, MOM turns to spectator section
       and happily notices the faces of GUS and SLOPPY
       smiling back to her in support.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                     (Annoyed at his witness)
                  PLEASE, Miss Hodges!

       DAD looks up at the unconvincing witness from
       reading "The Case Against Capital Punishment".

                       (Laughs like a lunatic)
                  Just blue...you know...like
                  blue!

       DET. BRADFORD is on the witness stand.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  ...And these books...
                    (Holding up "Urge to Kill",
                     "Mass Murder in Houston")
                  ...these disgusting books that
                  so lovingly describe the sadistic
                  acts of serial killers...Where
                  did you find these books?

                            DET. BRADFORD
                       (Looking at MOM hatefully)
                  In Beverly Sutphin's trash can.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                       (Smugly to MOM)
                  You may cross-examine, Mrs.
                  Sutphin.

       MOM takes over and smiles in conspiracy at GUS and
       SLOPPY who giggle in excitement about what is to
       come.

                            MOM
                       (To NAZLEROD)
                  Thank you.
                       (To DET. BRADFORD)
                  Detective Bradford, if I was
                  to look through your trash can,
                  what reading material would I
                  find?

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Objection!  Immaterial!

                            JUDGE
                  You may answer.

                            DET. BRADFORD
                  .."Time"..."Newsweek".  My
                  wife gets "Ladies Home Journal"...

                            MOM
                       (Smiling)
                  Well, this magazine was found in

                       (Turning bright red)
                  GODDAMN YOU!  THAT'S TRESPASSING!

       The entire courtroom bursts into laughter except for
       his partner, DET. MOORE, who looks at him in shock.
       GUS and SLOPPY laugh the loudest.

                            MOM
                  Don't judge people by what
                  they read, Detective.
                       (Smugly)
                  Your witness, Mr. Nazierod.

       MOM winks to SLOPPY and GUS.

                  The jury is instructed to ignore
                  the outburst of the witness.

                  I call to the stand Rosemary
                  Ackerman!

       Wipe to MRS. ACKERMAN on the stand holding the fire
       poker murder weapon tagged as evidence.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  ...and did you ever see the
                  fire poker again after you
                  left it with Mrs. Sutphin?

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  Yes!  Thirty minutes later
                  it was covered with blood and
                  gore and Carl Padgett was dead!

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  No further questions.

                            MOM
                   (Standing to cross-examine)
                  Mrs. Ackerman, when you left
                  me at the flea-market, where
                  did you go?

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  ...Browsing.

                            MOM
                  Did Carl Padgett buy
                  something you wanted?

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  I didn't want that Faberge
                  egg - it was chipped!

                            MOM
                  Carl Padgett died for the
                  Franklin Mint, didn't he?!

                     being pointed at her)
                  NO!  I could never hurt anyone!

       Spectators buzz.

                            MOM
                       (Not letting up)
                  That was your People magazine
                  with the letters cut out, wasn't it?

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  Yes, but I lent it...

                            MOM
                       (Cutting her off)
                  And those were your scissors
                  found sticking out of Mrs.
                  Sterner's stomach, weren't they?

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                       (Stuttering, panicked)
                  Yes...but...I didn't...

                            MOM
                       (Suddenly, dramatically)
                  Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
         
                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                   (Horrified at the sudden
                    silence in court as everyone
                    stares at her in hostility)
                  No...
                       (Weakly)
                  I don't have room in my kitchen...

       GUS, SLOPPY and all the spectators let out a howl of
       disapproval.  Even the JUDGE scowls at the witness
       in disgust.

       DET. MOORE is on witness stand being examined by the
       prosecution.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Detective Moore, did you
                  then proceed to the stage
                  area inside "Hammerjacks"?

                            DET. MOORE
                  Yes, I did.  Scotty Barnhiil
                  was on fire and he fell to
                  his knees in flames.

       BIRDIE looks up from reading "Ghandi" biography and
       gags as prosecutor hands DET. MOORE a gory 8x10
       glossy photo of victim.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Would this be what you saw?

                            DET. MOORE
                  Yes, sir.  A real barbecue.

       Suddenly a buzz starts in the courtroom and all
       heads turn to the back of the spectator section
       where the real life star, FARRAH FAWCETT* is
       entering with an entourage to "observe" Serial Mom.

       MOM acknowledges MS. FAWCETT with a dignified nod as
       DAD looks on in amazement.

       DET. MOORE, the JURY, even the JUDGE crane their
       necks to get a better look at FARRAH FAWCETT.

                            MR. NAZLEROD

                       (Impatiently)
                  May the photo be entered in as
                  evidence and passed to the jury?

                            JUDGE
                  Huh?...oh yeah...YES.

                            DET. MOORE
                       (Star-struck)
                  Jeeeeze!  It really is Farrah
                  Fawcett!

                      to contain himself)
                  I loved you in "The Burning

                  No further questions!
                         (Smugly looking at MOM)
                  I call to the stand, Marvin
                  Pickles.

167.   INTERIOR COURTROOM.

       MARVIN PICKLES hurriedly enters as all heads turn to
       follow him to the stand.  CHIP, who has joined
       BIRDIE and his family looks at MOM and sees her
       worried expression.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  State your name, please.

                            MARVIN
                  Marvin A. Pickles.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Were you in the men's room
                  at the Edmonson Drive In
                  Flea Market on Saturday,
                  September 19th?

                            MARVIN
                  Yes, I was.

       FARRAH FAWCETT answers a ringing mobile phone in her
       purse.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Did you see anybody in the
                  booth next to you?

       MARVIN sinks down lower in witness chair so he can
       get a better view up MOM's skirt.

                            MARVIN
                  I...um...
                       (Turned on)
                  uh...

       MOM looks at him confused, still unaware of his
       letchery.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                       (Getting testy)
                  Mr. Pickle!  Did you see
                  anybody in the booth next
                  to you?

                            MARVIN
                  I...1'm not sure...
                   (Really turned on,
                    starting to moan)
                  ...I...oohhh...Excuse me...

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                       (Outraged)
                  What do you mean, you're not
                  sure?!

       MOM suddenly realizes MARVIN is looking up her
       skirt.  In a brilliant legal maneuver she begins
       inching her skirt up a little higher under the table
       out of view of the rest of the courtroom, giving
       MARVIN a better view and hoping to change his
       damning testimony.

                            MARVIN
                   (Eyes popping out of head)
                  There was nobody next to me:

       Housewife trial groupies start buzzing wildly in
       newfound support of MOM.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                       (Losing it)
                  Mr. Pickles, you testified
                  before the Grand Jury that
                  you looked down and "saw a
                  pair of lady's shoes" in the
                  stall next to you.

       MOM smiles like the perfect saint as she begins
       flapping her leqe back and forth under the table,
       flashing MARVIN her very prim nun-like undergarments
       out of view of the rest of the courtroom.

                            MARVIN
                       (Lost in his own
                        perverted glory)
                  Ohhhh!  I just said what you
                  told me to!

       DAD looks over at MISTY and REPORTER BOYFRIEND who
       have rejoined the family in court and is horrified
       to see them with their arms wrapped around each
       other, cuddling.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  PERJURY IS A SERIOUS OFFENCE,
                  MR. PICKLES!!

       MOM is flapping her legs back and forth double time
       as MARVIN goes into his own private orgasm.

                            MARVZN
                  Ooohhhhhh!  I made it all up!
                  I never saw Beverly Sutphin
                  in my life!

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                       (Absolutely furious)
                  You'll pay for this, Marvin
                  A. Pickles!
                       (Returning to seat)
                  I'm turning your file over
                  to the vice-squad!!
                       (Sitting down)
                  The prosecution rests, your
                  honor.

                            MOM
                   (Giving MARVIN her version of
                    a sexy smile as he leaves stand)
                  The prosecution has proven
                  nothing, your honor.
                       (To the JURY)
                  The defense also rests!

       The spectators burst into spontaneous applause as
       DAD looks at the kids in fear at the upcoming
       verdict.

168.   Wipe to HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF COURTROOM.

       FARRAM FAWCETT is giving an impromptu press
       conference to the throng of adoring reporters.

                            FARRAH FAWCETT
                  ...I feel that Beverly Sutphin
                  is an innocent woman, wrongly
                  accused.  A normal housewife
                  trapped in a nightmare of
                  circumstantial evidence...

169.   INTERIOR COURTROOM.

       TIMOTHY NAZLEROD is giving the prosecution's closing
       argument.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                       (Pointing to MOM)
                  ...That's her!  Henrietta Lee
                  Lucas!  Joan Wayne Gacy!  A
                  new face in the deck of serial
                  killer trading cards... Find
                  her guilty of all five counts
                  of first degree murder...!

170.   HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF COURTROOM.

       FARRAH FAWCETT is still pontificating for the press.

                            FARRAH FAWCETT
                  ...I only hope that I can
                  portray "Serial Mom"'s life on
                  the TV screen with the proper
                  dignity that this feminist
                  heroine deserves.

171.   INTERIOR COURTROOM.

                            MOM
                   (Addressing the jury with
                    calm believability)
                  Look at me!  I'm a normal
                  person just like you are!

       DAD wipes away a tear as CHIP looks at a preliminary
       design for mini-series showing FARRAH FAWCETT done
       up as MOM.

                            MOM
                  ...But I've been framed by
                  the police...

       MISTY and REPORTER BOYFRIEND are now openly making
       out in courtroom.

                            MOM
                  ...and perjured against by
                  the very people I thought
                  were my friends...

       BIRDIE looks out of courtroom window and sees a bird
       eating a worm and shudders in horror as CHIP pats
       her hand affectionately.

                            MOM
                  ...All I ask is that you
                  have the courage to find
                  me innocent of these terribly
                  untrue charges...

172.   HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF COURTROOM.

       FARRAH FAWCETT is "reenacting" MOM's closing
       argument for the enthralled press corp.

                            FARRAH FAWCETT
                       (Hammily)
                  ...All I ask is that you find
                  me innocent of these terribly
                  untrue charges...

173.   INTERIOR COURTROOM.

       Dissolve to stern-faced JURORS filing back into jury
       box, not looking at MOM.  Subtitle appears "Two days
       later.  Thursday, January 21st.  3:20pm" and then
       fades out.

                            JUDGE
                  Ladies and Gentlemen of
                  the Jury, have you reached
                  a verdict?

                            FOREMAN
                  Yes we have, your honor...

       JUROR #8 gives MOM a smile.

                            FOREMAN
                  ...We find the defendant
                  not guilty of all charges.

       Courtroom erupts in pandemonium, FARRAH FAWCETT
       cheering the loudest.  MOM turns to family who sit
       stunned in seats.

                            MOM
                  I'm coming home!!

       DAD forces a weak smile as he turns white as a
       ghost.

                            JUDGE
                       (Bangs gavel in disgust)
                  Court adjourned!

                            DAD
                    (Whispering to a shocked
                     CHIP and MISTY)
                  ...What should I do?

                            CHIP
                       (Suddenly nervous)
                  Bring her home...I guess.

                            BIRDIE
                       (Mumbling to herself)
                  No more violence...No more
                  violence...

                            REPORTER BOYFRIEND
                  Think she'll like me?

                            MISTY
                       (Worried)
                  Just be nice to her.  And try
                  ...just try not to get on her
                  nerves.

       MOM rushes over to DAD, free at last and gives him a
       big hug as press, fans, even the jury cheer her
       victory.

174.   INTERIOR COURTROOM HALLWAY.

       The stunned Sutphin family exits as MOM raises fists
       like "Rocky" to cheers of her supporters.

                            MOM
                    (Graciously accepting
                     flowers, signing autographs,
                     posing for the press)
                  I love you!  Thanks for coming!
                     (Slows a kiss to newsteam)
                  Hi Los Angeles!
                     (Looking into another camera)
                  Hello Cleveland!
                     (And another)
                  And you too, New York!

       Down the hall, inside a bank of old fashioned wooden
       phone booths is JUROR #8, excitedly talking on pay
       phone.

                            JUROR #8
                       (Proudly)
                  We did it!  We set her free!
                  I knew she was innocent
                  right from the beginning!...

       Without warning, MOM slams her way into phone booth,
       hangs up the call and grabs receiver out of JUROR
       #8's hand.

                            MOM
                       (Snarling scarily)
                  You can't wear white shoes
                  after Labor Day!

                            JUROR #8
                       (Stammering in open-mouthed
                        terror)
                  No...please...that's not
                  true anymore.

                            MOM
                  Oh yes it is!
                       (In homicidal fury)
                  Didn't your mother ever
                  tell you?!

       MOM suddenly bludgeons JUROR #8 over the head with
       the telephone receiver.

                            MOM
                  Well, now you know!

       JUROR #8, stunned by the blow, struggles to stay
       conscious.

                            JUROR #8
                       (Staggering in pain)
                  But...fashion has changed...

                            MOM
                       (Enraged)
                  No it hasn't!

       MOM imediately hits JUROR #8 over the head again
       with the telephone receiver.

       As JUROR #8's screams are drowned out by the passing
       PRESS MOB, MOM hits her again and again with the
       telephone receiver until JUROR #8 collapses to the
       ground, her white summer shoes turned red with her
       own blood.

       Cut back to Sutphin family, holding on to each other
       for dear life as the mob of supporters swell around
       them.

                            DAD
                     (Realizing MOM is missing
                      in the confusion)
                  Beverly?  Beverly?

       MOM flies out of phone booth wearing a big smile,
       not missing a beat.

                            MOM
                  Right here, honey.

                            PRESS
                  Mrs. Sutphin, can we get
                  a shot with you and Farrah
                  Fawcett?

                            MOM
                  Certainly.

       FARRAH FAWCETT barges in and takes over.

                            FARRAH
                  Hello, Beverly.  I'm Farrah
                  Fawcett
                      (Pulling MOM rudely)
                  You stand here...
                      (To PRESS)
                  Ok, boys, a medium two shot...

                            MOM
                   (Trying to get on other
                    side of FAWCETT)
                  ...but please...if I could
                  just...

                            FARRAH
                    (Rudely shoving MOM back
                     in place)
                  Stay there, Beverly.
                       (Posing)
                  Smile, Serial Mom!

       Flashbulbs explode.

                            MOM
                   (Hissing to FARRAH in the
                    scariest, most threatening
                    voice yet)
                  THAT'S MY BAD SIDE, FARRAH
                  FAWCETT!!

       A JUROR down the hall screams in horror as she opens
       phone booth door and a bloody white shoe pops out.

       FARRAH FAWCETT looks back at MOM in sudden fear.

       MOM glares back with the face of a madwoman.

       Freeze frame.

       Dissolve to epilogue title card:  "Beverly Sutphin
       is a free woman."

       MOM, BEVERLY, a trim, fortyish, pretty Betty Crocker
       of the 90's, grabs the toast as it pops up and
       butters it. She waves cheerfully out the kitchen
       window to the passing GARBAGEMEN on the back of a
       Baltimore County garbage truck and then turns to her
       husband and children and expertly begins to serve
       breakfast.

       DAD, EUGENE, the ultimate nice guy and a dentist by
       trade, divides the morning paper up between himself
       and son CHIP, a cute semi-hip kid who is still in
       high-school.  Daughter, MISTY, a pretty and slightly
       overweight college student, frantically prices the
       junk she plans on selling at the flea market after
       classes while gulping down a light breakfast.

                            MOM
                  Who wants fruit salad?

                            MISTY
                  I do, please.

                            MOM
                       (Hesitating)
                  That's not gum in your mouth,
                  is it?

                            MISTY
                       (Removing it)
                  It's sugarless.

                            MOM
                       (Gently)
                  You know how I hate gum,
                  Misty.  All that chomping
                  and cheesing...
                       (Begins serving her)

                            MISTY
                  Sorry, Mom.  Thanks.
                   (To her brother, as she
                    prices a record album)
                  Hey, Chip, think I could get
                  50c for Vanilla Ice.

                            CHIP
                  I wouldn't give ya a nickle.

                            MISTY
                          (Dreamily)
                  Carl can't believe how much I
                  make at swap meets.

                            MOM
                  (Rolling her eyes good-naturedly)
                  And who may I ask is Carl?

                            MISTY
                  Just a boy.  He's picking me up
                  this morning.

                            CHIP
                  Here we go again.

                            MISTY
                  He's really cute!

                            MOM
                    (Watching the cute little
                     birds nibbling seed from
                     the bird-feeder in kitchen
                     window)
                  Cute is not enough, Misty.
                  You know that.

                            CHIP
                  She sure can pick 'em!

                            MISTY
                       (Exasperated)
                  He goes to college with me!

                            DAD
                  Leave her alone, Chip.
                       (To MOM)
                  I think it's great she has a
                  new beau, Beverly.

       MOM smiles kindly, picks up a box of cereal in each
       hand and turns to the family.

                            MOM
                  Cereal anybody?

       Title "SERIAL MOM" appears on the screen.

                            DAD
                  Just a little, please.  Bad
                  for the teeth.

                            CHIP
                  Always the dentist.

                            MOM
                  Chip, honey?

                            CHIP
                  Thanks, Mom.

       As MOM serves the cereal, she spots a lone fly as it
       lands on the butter dish.  Without letting on to her
       family, she grabs a flyswatter and begins stalking
       the fly with a terrifying intensity, its buzzing
       enough to make MOM's head explode.

                            DAD
                       (Reading paper)
                  Look at this!
                  (Reading out loud in disgust)
                  "Hillside Strangler gets his
                  college degree in prison!"

                            MOM
                  (Preoccupied, stalking fly)
                  That's nice.

                            DAD
                  Nice?!  He should have been
                  executed!

                            MISTY
                  He killed people, Mom.

                            MOM
                       (To herself)
                  We all have bad nights.
                  (Gets ready to swat, but fly
                   buzzes off)

                            CHIP
                       (To MISTY)
                  You'd probably date him!
                       (Mimicking her)
                  He's cu-uuute!  Hey, Dad, did
                  you ever see "Henry, Portrait of
                  a Serial Killer?"

                            DAD
                  I certainly did not.

                            MISTY
                  You've been working in that
                  video shop too long.

                            DAD
                  And all that gore better hadn't be
                  interfering with your schoolwork.

       MOM stalks fly as it lands on CHIP's toast as the
       rest of the family remains oblivious to MOM's
       building anger.

                            CHIP
                  I do great in school, Dad.
                  (Eats toast as fly buzzes off)

       A sickened and rage-filled MOM stalks the fly to
       DAD's orange juice glass where it secretes on the
       rim in closeup.

                            DAD
                  Well, your mother's going to PTA
                  today.  We'll see what your
                  teacher has to say.
                  (Takes a big gulp as fly buzzes away)

                            CHIP
                  (Giving a pleading look to MOM as
                   the buzzing of the fly builds in
                   intensity on the soundtrack)
                  Aw, Mom!  I hate Mr. Stubbins!

                            MOM
                  (Moving in for the kill, hissing
                   the words in a rage)
                  Don't say the word "hate", honey.
                  "Hate" is a very serious word!

       MOM swats violently and we see fly splat in bloody
       closeup. ("Directed by John Waters" credit appears).

       Family is suddenly silent as they uneasily look up
       in surprise at MOM's ferocious attack.

       MOM quickly wipes up squashed fly and smiles back at
       her family.

                            MOM
                  There.  All better.
                       (Suddenly all innocence)
                  Anybody for scrambled eggs?

       END OF CREDITS.

       A loud banging is heard on the back door.  MOM jumps up
       guiltily.

                            DAD
                  (Getting up from table)
                  Who on earth...?

       MOM opens door to two police detectives in plain
       clothes.  DETECTIVE MOORE is younger and more rugged
       than the older more world-weary DETECTIVE BRADFORD.

                            DET. MOORE
                  Mrs. Sutphin?

                            MOM
                       (Nervously)
                  Yes?

                            DET. MOORE
                       (Shows badge)
                  I'm Detective Moore and this
                  is Detective Bradford.

                       (Taking over)
                  I'm Dr. Eugene Sutphin.  What's
                  the trouble, officer?

                            CHIP
                       (Excitedly)
                  Is there a killer loose?

                            DET. MOORE
                  No son, nothing that exciting.

                            MOM
                  This is my son, Chip...and my
                  daughter, Misty.

                  Det. Bradford, I'm sorry but
                  we don't allow gum chewing
                  in this house.
                     (Hands him a paper napkin)

                     (Spitting his gum into
                      paper napkin)
                  Sorry, ma'am.

                    an envelope)

                  phone calls and mail threats to
                  a certain Mrs. Dottie Hinkle.

                            MOM
                  I know Dottie!

                            DAD
                  She lives right down the street.

                            DET. BRADFORD
                  Could you take a look at this...

                            DET. MOORE
                  ...And tell us of anybody who
                  might be responsible?

                            DET. BRADFORD
                  (As he hands note to MOM and DAD)
                  I should warn you...this note
                  contains LANGUAGE.

       MOM and DAD open note.  In cut-out letters from a
       magazine it reads:  "I'LL GET YOU PUSSY FACE!"

                            MOM
                       (Recoiling)
                  Oh God, really!
                   (Hands it back to cop)
                  This is the limit!

                  Sorry, son.
                       (In disgust)
                  This is a matter for adults.

                            MOM
                  Officers, I've never said the
                  P-word out loud, much less
                  written it down!

                            DAD
                  No woman would!

                    (Imitating bird call)
                  Peter Pan!  Peter Pan!  Peter Pan!

       CHIP and MISTY roll their eyes in embarrassment as
       bird calls back to MOM.

                            BIRD
                  Peter Pan!  Peter Pan!  Peter Pan!

       DAD smiles proudly as detectives look at MOM in
       amazement.

4.     EXTERIOR SUTPHIN HOUSE.

       A convertible pulls into driveway driven by CHIP's
       best friend, SCOTTY BARNHILL, a handsome but sullen
       red-necky teen.  Next to him is CHIP's girlfriend,
       BIRDIE STUART, a sexy tom-boy with lots of savvy.

                    (To cops, getting into his car)
                  That's Birdie.  She's a horror nut
                  just like my son.

                            MOM

                   (Overdramatic, feigning horror)
                  I didn't do it!  I swear!  Don't
                  lock me up!  I'll take a lie detector!

                    SCOTTY in car)
                  Good morning Scotty!

       SCOTTY guiltily looks up from vintage Betty Page
       pin-up mag he's reading and toots horn defiantly in
       response as MOM grits her teeth.

                            BIRDIE
                  Hey Misty, look what I got!
                   (Pulling it out of bag)
                  A Pee Wee Herman Doll.  Can you
                  sell it for me at the flea market?

                       (Impressed)
                  Wow!  Still in the box!  I sure can!

                    speeding towards the house)
                  Oh God, here comes Carl!

       DAD pulls off in his car and almost collides with
       CARL as he aggressively manoeuvres his car up the
       driveway.

       CARL PADGETT, a handsome jock climbs out of his car.

                  You must be Mrs. Sutphin.
                  I'm Carl Padgett.

                            MOM
                  Misty's date...

                            CARL
                  More of a friend really...

       MISTY looks hurt.

                            MISTY
                         (To CARL)
                  See what Birdie gave me to
                  sell at the flea market?

                            CARL
                       (Sneering at Pee-Wee)
                  That guy's a weirdo.

       MOM'S smile freezes on her face as CHIP and BIRDIE
       hop in SCOTTY's convertible.

                            MOM
                   (Pointing to SCOTTY and
                    calling out to COPS as they
                    get into their car)
                  Now there's something you should
                  be interested in, detectives.  A
                  grown boy who doesn't wear his
                  seat belts!

       SCOTTY gives MOM a hateful look and peels out.

7.     DISSOLVE TO SUBURBAN STREET.  DET. MOORE and DET.
       BRADFORD sit in their unmarked police car, drinking
       coffee and filling out police reports.

                            DET. BRADFORD
                     (Once again chewing gum)
                  Christ, that one was Beaver
                  Cleaver's mother.
                       (Imitating her)
                  Peter Pan!  Peter Pan!  Peter Pan!

                            DET. MOORE
                       (Good-naturedly)
                  Oh, leave her alone.  Mrs. Sutphin's
                  about as normal and nice a lady
                  we're ever going to find.

8.     INTERIOR BEVERLY AND EUGENE SUTPHIN'S BEDROOM.

       MOM is sitting on bed, dialing phone with a
       determined expression on her face.

       Subtitle appears: "9:37am" and fades out.

       In split screen, DOTTIE HINKLE, the harrassed middle
       aged neighbor, looks at her ringing phone in her
       living room with suspicion and finally answers.

                            DOTTIE
                           (Angrily)
                  Hello.

                            MOM
                       (Speaking in disguised voice)
                  Is this the Cocksucker residence?

                            DOTTIE
                       (Rising to the bait
                         every time)
                  Goddamn you!  STOP CALLING HERE!

                            MOM
                  Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?

                            DOTTIE
                           (Furious)
                  You bitch!

                            MOM
                  Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?

                            DOTTIE
                  The police are tracing your call
                  right this minute.

                            MOM
                  Well, Dottie, how come they're
                  not here then, Fuck-Face?

                            DOTTIE
                       (Red with rage)
                  FUCK YOU!
                       (Slams down phone)

       MOM giggles to herself like a little kid and
       immediately redials the phone.

9.     EXTERIOR SUTPHIN HOUSE.  BACK DOOR.

       ROSEMARY ACKERMAN, MOM's frumpy, brittle, busy-body
       next door neighbor, is knocking on door, carrying a
       sewing basket.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                         (Calling out)
                  Beverly?  Beverly darling?
                  You home?
                    (She lets herself in)
                  I know you are...

10.    INTERIOR MOM'S BEDROOM.

       MOM is laughing to herself listening to ringing
       phone while MRS. HINKLE, on split-screen, tries not
       to answer.  Finally she lunges for it.

                            DOTTIE
                       (Answering)
                  FUCK YOU TOO, YOU ROTTEN WHORE!!

                            MOM
                    (Disguising her voice
                       in prim manner)
                  I beg your pardon?

                            DOTTIE
                    (Horrified but suspicious)
                  Who is this?

                            MOM
                  Mrs. Wilson from the telephone
                  company.  I understand you're
                  having problems with obscene calls.

                            DOTTIE
                       (Mortified)
                  Yes, I am...I'm sorry Mrs. Wilson..
                  It's driving me crazy...I've
                  changed my number twice already...
                  Please help me!

11.    INTERIOR SUTPHIN KITCHEN.

       ROSEMARY ACKERMAN walks through kitchen, wipes a
       finger on window ledge to check for dust and calls
       out Beverly's name.

12.    INTERIOR MOM'S BEDROOM.

       MOM doesn't hear MRS. ACKERMAN as she continues her
       phone conversation with MRS. HINKLE.

                            MOM
                   (Still the fake telephone
                    company representative)
                  What exactly does this sick
                  individual say to you?

                            DOTTIE
                  I can't say it out loud.
                  don't use bad language.

13.    INTERIOR MOM'S LIVING ROOM.

       MRS. ACKERMAN looks up at huge oil portrait of MOM
       in ornate frame hanging over couch and calls out
       Beverly's name.  Hearing muffled voices behind MOM'S
       closed bedroom door at the top of the steps, MRS.
       ACKERMAN begins to creep up the steps.

14.    INTERIOR MOM'S BEDROOM.

       Split screen with MOM and DOTTIE HINKLE.

                            MOM
                     (Still impersonating)
                  I know it's hard but we need
                  the exact words.

                            DOTTIE
                  Alright, I'll try...
                         (Primly)
                  "Cocksucker".  That's what
                  she calls me.

                            MOM
                   (Laughs hideously, begins
                    speaking in her scary voice)
                  Listen to your dirty mouth, you
                  fucking whore!

                            DOTTIE
                         (Ballistic)
                  GODDAMN YOU!

15.    INTERIOR HALLWAY OUTSIDE MOM'S BEDROOM.

       MRS. ACKERMAN hears muffled shouts and reaches for
       door handle.

16.    INTERIOR BEDROOM.  SPLIT SCREEN BETWEEN MOM AND
       DOTTIE.

                            DOTTIE
                  MOTHERFUCKER!!

                            MOM
                  COCKSUCKER!
                       (Slams down phone)

       MRS. ACKERMAN barges right in bedroom, almost
       catching MOM who expertly snaps back to normal
       without missing a beat.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  Beverly, are you alright?

                            MOM
                  Rosemary, honey.  Good morning.
                  I'm fine.
                     (Taking the sewing basket)
                  Thanks for remembering.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  It's the least I could do.
                       (Suspicious)
                  I heard shouting.

       MOM opens sewing box to reveal a pair of gleaming
       sewing scissors.

                            MOM
                       (Slamming it shut)
                  Just the damn cable TV company.
                  You know how they are.
                  Did you hear about Dottie Hinkle?

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  Yes, I did.  It's terrifying!
                  The police were at my house this
                  morning.

                            MOM
                  Who on earth would want to
                  harrass poor Dottie Hinkle?

17.    EXTERIOR DOTTIE HINKLE'S SUBURBAN HOUSE.

       DOTTIE HINKLE, still angry and occasionally cursing
       to herself, digs in her prize flower garden out
       front of her house behind ornamental wishing-well on
       front lawn.  Subtitle appears: "2:15pm" and then
       fades out.

       Cut to MOM, driving happily by in her station wagon
       as she waves to DOTTIE.

       DOTTIE sees MOM, tries to look cheerful and waves
       back.

       Cut back to MOM who looks in her rear view mirror,
       sees she's not being followed and suddenly screeches
       car into a U-turn as MOM's "Psycho Theme" plays on
       soundtrack

       MOM's face turns to stone as ripple flashback
       effects dissolve to that fateful day in the mall
       when MOM pulled up to parallel park and DOTTIE
       HINKLE stole her place from behind.

       Ripple effects dissolve to the present as the wheels
       of MOM'S car skid to a stop.  The car door opens and
       MOM's sensible shoes step out as "Mom Psycho Theme"
       builds.

       MOM closes car door quietly, watches DOTTIE HINKLE
       up the street undetected and then takes the scissors
       from her purse and hides them up her sleeve.

       As MOM sneaks up street towards DOTTIE, intercut are
       obsessional flashbacks of details of the traumatic
       parking place incident;  MOM'S POV of DOTTIE pulling
       into space, DOTTIE'S maddening nonchalance as she
       snottily gets out of her car and trots right past
       MOM without the slightest apology, MOM'S sputtering
       face paralyzed with anger when she realizes there is
       nowhere else to park.

       Back in the present, MOM starts walking faster and
       faster as she sees DOTTIE begin to pack up her
       gardening tools to go back inside her house.
         
       Arriving just a second too late as DOTTIE closes the
       door behind her, MOM spots a can of gasoline near
       DOTTIE's lawnmower.  Thinking fast, MOM dumps gas on
       DOTTIE's mail in the mailbox on porch, lights it on
       fire and runs from the flames, happily throwing a
       coin into DOTTIE's wishing well as an afterthought.
         
       MOM walks as fast as possible back to her car, gets
       in and pulls off.  Smiling evily to herself, she
       drives by and sees DOTTIE HINKLE screaming in horror
       and trying to beat the fire out with a broom.

18.    EXTERIOR TOWSON SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL.

       Parking lot is filled and the few last parents are
       entering the building for PTA meeting.  MOM speeds
       into lot and gets out of car.  Subtitle appears:
       "3:O6pm" and fades out.

19.    INTERIOR CLASSROOM.

       MR. STUBBINS, Chip's teacher, is winding down a
       one-on-one meeting with another mother, who is in
       tears.

                            MRS. TAPLOTTER
                  But, Mr. Stubbins, my son
                  studies every night!  He's
                  trying as hard as he can...

                            MR. STUBBINS
                  Some teenagers just aren't college
                  material, Mrs, Taplotter.  It's
                  nothing to cry over.  Now, there
                  are other parents waiting.
                       (Smugly)
                  ...thank you for taking the time
                  to come to PTA.

20.    INTERIOR SCHOOL HALLWAY.  OUTSIDE MR. STUBBINS'
       CLASSROOM.

       Parents are seated in folding chairs waiting to be
       called in to conference.  MOM comes rushing down
       corridor and other parents greet her.

                            MRS. STERNER
                  Hi, Beverly.

                            MOM
                  Hi, Betty.  Oh, I love your
                  outfit.

                            MRS. STERNER
                  Thanks.
                          (Snobbily)
                  It's a Liz Claiborne.

                            MR. STERNER
                  Mrs. Sutphin, where's that
                  husband of yours?
                   (Making a bad dental joke
                    and pointing to his teeth)
                  Feeling "down in the mouth"?!
                  Hohohohohoho!

                            MOM
                    (Smiling through her teeth)
                  You're soooo funny, Ralph...

       MR. STUBBINS leans his head out of classroom and
       looks at roll book as MRS. TAPLOTTER leaves, dabbing
       her tears with a handkerchief.

                            MR. STUEBINS
                  Mrs...Sutphin?

                            MOM
                       (Excited)
                  Right here!

       MOM goes in classroom with him.

21.    INTERIOR CLASSROOM.

                            MR. STUBBINS
                  Mrs. Sutphin, I'm Paul Stubbins,
                  Chip's math teacher.

                            MOM
                       (Shaking hands)
                  Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.
                       (Handing him a tin)
                  A little something I baked.

                            MR. STUBBINS
                       (Peeking inside)
                  Oooohh!  A fruit cake.  Thank
                  you, Mrs. Sutphin.  Have a seat.

                            MOM
                  Bon Appetit!

       They sit on opposite sides of his desk.

                            MR. STUBBINS
                  Chip is off to a fine start
                  this year.
                       (Checking his roll book)
                  Focused...conscientious...
                  participates actively in
                  classroom discussion.

                            MOM
                       (Proudly)
                  He's a good boy.

                            MR. STUBBINS
                       (Suddenly serious)
                  There is one big problem though.

       MOM'S smile freezes on her face ever so subtly

                            MOM
                  What is it, Mr. Stubbins?

                            MR. STUBBINS
                       (Spitting out the words)
                  His unhealthy obsession with
                  sick horror films.

                            MOM
                       (Relieved)
                  He is assistant manager of a
                  video shop...

                            MR. STUBBINS
                       (Cutting her off)
                  That's no excuse for a morbid
                  imagination.  I caught him
                  drawing this in class last week.
                   (Unfolds lurid drawing of woman
                    getting her tongue pulled out
                    with the title, "Blood Feast")
                  Is there a problem at home?

                            MOM
                       (Shocked)
                  Certainly not!

                            MR. STUBBINS
                  Divorce?  An alcoholic relative?
                       (Knowingly)
                  Tell me, did Chip torture animals
                  when he was young?

                            MOM
                       (Furious)
                  No, he did not! We are a loving
                  supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.

                            MR. STUBBINS
                  Well, you're doing something
                  wrong, Mrs. Sutphin.  I'd
                  recommend therapy for your son.
                       (Rising from his chair)
                  Thank you for taking the time
                  to come to PTA.

23.    INTERIOR CHIP'S BEDROOM.

       On CHIP's large video screen plays the ridiculously
       dated but still appalling scene from "BLOOD FEAST"
       where the madman with the corny, madeup eyebrows
       rips a girl's tongue out of her mouth in hokey
       special effects.

       Subtitle reads "4:22pm" and fades out.

       CHIP and BIRDIE are hooting and hollering and eating
       popcorn as SCOTTY looks up from his vintage
       nudist-camp magazine to watch in real horror and
       nausea.

                            BIRDIE
                  It's a sheep's tongue!

                            SCOTTY
                  Man, I just ate.  Turn it off.

                            CHIP
                  Rewind it!  Let's see it again!

                            SCOTTY
                  No!  That shit is sickening!
                  Put on pussy!

                       (Torturing SCOTTY)
                  Look, Dick-Head!
                       (Gore scene replays)
                  SLOW-MOTION!

       SCOTTY starts to gag and tries to hide it,

                            BIRDIE
                       (Looking at screen)
                  BLOOD FEAST!

                  The "Citizen Kane" of gore
                  movies.

       SCOTTY looks at gore on video, jumps up to run to
       bathroom, yanks open bedroom door and screams when
       he sees MOM standing there with a plate of chocolate
       chip cookies.

                            MOM
                  I don't know what it is about
                  today, but I FEEL GREAT!

                            SCOTTY
                       (Gagging)
                  Excuse me, Mrs. Sutphin.

       He runs past her to the bathroom.

                            CHIP
                  Hi, Mom.

                            BIRDIE
                  Hi, Mrs. Sutphin.

       MOM looks at TV monitor and sees madman taking out
       heart of girl.  MOM smiles inappropriately.

                            MOM
                       (Giggles)
                  You kids.  Now Birdie, I want
                  you to have a cookie and then
                  run along home.

                            CHIP
                  But Mom, the video's not over.

                            MOM
                  No "but mom" for you, young man.
                  Mr. Stubbins seems to think these
                  silly movies are interfering with
                  your studies.
                   (Turns off video with remote)

                            BIRDIE
                       (Rolling her eyes)
                  Oh, boy!
                       (Getting ready to leave)

                            CHIP
                  Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!

       SCOTTY comes back in room feeling better.

                            SCOTTY
                  Man, that one made me puke!

                            MOM
                   (Picking up SCOTTY's nudist
                    camp magazine and handing it
                    back to him like it's poison)
                  You forgot something...

                            SCOTTY
                       (Looking around confused)
                  Are we leaving?

                            MOM
                  Yes you are.

       SCOTTY guiltily takes back magazine as BIRDIE drags
       him out.

                            BIRDIE
                  Bye, Mrs, Sutphin.

                            CHIP
                       (Affectionately)
                  Bye, bird-brain,  See ya, Scotty.

                            MOM
                  Bye, Birdie.
                   (Sitting down next to CHIP
                       on his bed)
                  Chip, honey...I know it's hard
                  being a teenager but I understand..
                  I'm your mother and I love you.

                            CHIP
                  Oh Mom...

                            MOM
                       (Suddenly his buddy)
                  Can we watch that scene again?
                  You know, where he rips out
                  her heart?
                       (Giggling scarily)
                  PLEEEASE?

       CHIP looks back at his MOM in sudden confusion.

24.    SUTPHIN KITCHEN.

       taken out of the oven by MOM.  Subtitle appears
       "6:30pm" and fades out.

25.    SUTPHIN DINING ROOM.

       DAD, MISTY and CHIP sit around dining room table.
       MOM enters with the meatloaf and a smile.

                            MOM
                       (Jokingly)
                  Ladies and gentlemen, the
                  perfect meatloaf!

                            CHIP
                  Looks good, Mom!

                            DAD
                  Nothing like a home cooked
                  meal, honey.

                            MOM
                  Misty, I made your favorite
                  sesame broccoli...
                       (Passes it to her)

                            MISTY
                  Yummy.  Carl says if I lose
                  ten pounds, he'll take me to
                  the University of Maryland
                  Fall Mixer.

                            MOM
                       (Appalled)
                  Misty, if you want to lose
                  weight go ahead, but do it for
                  yourself, not for some boy you
                  barely know.

                            CHIP
                  Carl's a jerk!

                            DAD
                  He certainly drives like a jerk.

                            MISTY
                       (Getting upset)
                  Carl makes me happy and that
                  threatens this family, doesn't it?

                            DAD
                  Doesn't threaten me, honey.
                  I'm happy.

                            MOM
                  I'm happy too and we want you
                  to be happy.

                            CHIP
                       (Mockingly)
                  I'm so happy I could shit.

                            MOM
                  CHIP!  You know how much I
                  hate the brown word!

       Suddenly a scream from outside is heard.

                  That's Rosemary.  Something's
                  wrong!

       CHIP and MISTY look at one another and stick fingers
       down their throats at mention of MRS. ACKERMAN'S
       name.

       ROSEMARY ACKERMAN runs in from kitchen in hysterics.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  Turn on the news!

                            BIRDIE
                  This is so cool! It's just like
                  a horror movie.

       ANNOUNCER comes on TV.

                            CHIP
                  It's on!  I'll call you back!

                  Mr. Paul Stubbins was

                  Whoever did it should get the
                  death penalty!

       MOM yawns absentmindedly.

                     (Disapprovingly at TV screen)
                  Look at her hair!
                       (To CHIP)
                  Turn it off, honey.

                            CHIP
                       (He does)
                       (In shock)
                  I can't believe Mr. Stubbins
                  is dead.

                            MISTY
                  You said you hated him.

                            CHIP
                  Well...he was an asshole...
                  but he didn't deserve to die!

29.    SUTPHIN MASTER BEDROOM.

       Wipe to MOM finishing a silent prayer kneeling next
       to bed as DAD reads a spy novel under the covers.
       Subtitle appears: "10:45pm" and fades out.

                            DAD
                    (Putting down his book
                     as MOM climbs in)
                  I can't stop thinking about
                  that poor teacher.
                    (Turning out light on
                     his side of bed)
                  Goodnight, honey.  Don't read
                  late, we've got a big day with
                  the birds tomorrow.

                            MOM
                   (Picking up and leafing through
                    "The Encyclopedia of Birds")
                  I've identified every little
                  birdie we're going to watch
                  tomorrow on the Eastern Shore.

       We see that underneath the cover of the bird book,
       MOM is reading "Helter Skelter".  She lightly
       caresses a picture of Manson and closes the book and
       turns out her light.

                            DAD
                  Goodnight, honey.

                            MOM
                  Don't I get a kiss?

                            DAD
                       (Moving closer)
                  I just thought with all the
                  sadness...you wouldn't want...

                            MOM
                       (Snuggling up)
                  We have to concentrate on
                  life, Eugene.

                            DAD
                       (Kissing her)
                  It's fine with me, Beverly.
                   (Kisses her again more
                    passionately)
                  You want to, honey?  You
                  think the kids are asleep?

                            MOM
                  We can be real quiet...

                            DAD
                       (Getting on top of her)
                  I love that you're my wife.

                            MOM
                       (Getting turned on)
                  You're not bad yourself,
                  coo-coo bird...

                            DAD
                   (Gently making love to her)
                  You bring me such peace...

                            MOM
                  Oohhhh, Eugene!

                            DAD
                  Shhhh..

                            MOM
                       (Getting louder)
                  Oooohhhh.

                            DAD
                  Don't wake the kids...

                            MOM
                       (Even louder)
                  Ooohhhh!

30.    MISTY'S BEDROOM.

       We see MISTY, hair in curlers, pricing junk for flea
       market, stop and listen to sounds coming from
       parents' bedroom.

31.    SUTPHIN BEDROOM.

       MOM and DAD are having romantic monogomous sex.

                            MOM
                  Oooohhh!  Yeah!  Yeah!

                            DAD
                       (Really turned on)
                  You're hot tonight, honey...
                  but be quiet!  Shhhh! The kids!

32.    CHIP'S BEDROOM.

       CHIP looks up from reading "Fangoria Magazine" and
       listens in horror to his mother's distant moaning.

33.    SUTPHIN BEDROOM.

       MOM is panting wildly, a suburban sex machine.  DAD
       is amazed but hardly complaining.

                            MOM
                  Yeah!  Oohhhh!  Get it!

                            DAD
                  Ooh, honey, I'm ready!
                  Now!  Now!

                            MOM
                   (In orgasm, wildly thrashing)
                  Oohhhhh!  Yeah!  Yeah!

34.    HALLWAY BETWEEN CHIP AND MISTY'S BEDROOMS.

       CHIP and MISTY open bedroom doors simultaneously,
       hear their parents climaxing and look at one another
       in complete horror.

       Fade to black.

35.    Slow fade in to EXTERIOR SUTPHIN HOUSE.

       Birds are heard greeting the sunrise with their
       happy chirping.  Subtitle appears "Saturday,
       September l9th, 5:3Oam" and fade out.

36.    INTERIOR SUTPHIN BEDROOM.

       MOM, dressed for bird-watching day-trip, watches the
       cute little chickadees nibbling seed out of her
       birdfeeder on lawn through binoculars from bedroom
       window.  DAD, half-awake, stirs in his bed.

                            MOM
                   (Tracking a particularly
                    cute bird)
                  There's Dede! He's my favorite
                  chickadee!  He's here every
                  morning for breakfast.

                            DAD
                       (Groggy)
                  Well, honey, chickadees breed
                  in Alaska, you know.  No wonder
                  Dede's hungry.  It's a long
                  trip all the way to Baltimore.

       MOM continues tracking the bird in her binoculars
       until she freezes in horror at the sight of MRS.
       ACKERMAN running her mouth next door to DETECTIVES
       MOORE and BRADFORD and pointing to MOM's car.

       Suddenly the phone rings with jangling intensity.
       MOM jumps.

                            DAD
                  Hello...

       On split screen is obnoxious man from PTA, MR.
       STERNER, holding his jaw in pain.

                            MR. STERNER
                  Eugene, it's Ralph Sterner.
                  Got a dental emergency here!
                       (Moans in pain)
                  I mean this goddamn tooth is
                  killing me!

                            DAD
                  Well, Mr. Sterner, if you
                  call my office, I'm sure we
                  can see you Monday.

       MOM starts shaking her head "No" to DAD just in
       case.

                            MR. STERNER
                  MONDAY?

       MRS. STERNER, his wife, grabs the phone.

                            MRS. STERNER
                  Eugene, this is Betty Sterner,
                  He'll die by Monday!  The
                  roots are infected!  He might
                  have a heart attack!

                            DAD
                       (Wearily)
                  All right, Mrs. Sterner...
                  Nine o'clock.

       MOM's face changes to purple rage as she turns to
       hide her anger from DAD.

                            DAD
                       (Hangs up)
                  I'm sorry, honey.  But the birds
                  will still be there next week.

                            MOM
                   (Turning to face DAD,
                    suddenly stoic)
                  It's Ok, Eugene.  I understand..
                  I'll go fix breakfast.
                       (Exits calmly)

37.    INTERIOR HALLWAY OUTSIDE SUTPHIN'S BEDROOM.

       MOM's calm turns to immediate rage as she closes
       bedroom door and storms her way downstairs as "Mom's
       Psycho Theme" blares on soundtrack.

38.    CHIP'S BEDROOM

       CHIP is sound asleep.  MOM enters in a fury.

                            MOM
                    (In his ear, loudly)
                  CHIP!!

                            CHIP
                      (Jumping up in fear
                       from sleep)
                  God, Mom!
                   (Looking at her scary face)
                  What's the matter?

                            MOM
                      (Back to normal,
                          sweetly)
                  Time to get up, that's all.
                  You'll be late for work.

                            CHIP
                  You scared me.

39.    INTERIOR SUTPHIN KITCHEN.

       MISTY is sobbing in fury as she sits forlornly with
       boxed up flea-market junk.  MOM enters and is
       startled to see her.

                            MOM
                   Honey, what's the matter?

       MOM looks out back window in alarm to see DET. MOORE
       snooping through her box of recycled newspapers as
       DET. BRADFORD noses around her station wagon.

                            MISTY
                  I'm stoodup!  I'll kill
                  that bastard!

                            MOM
                  Don't say words unless you
                  mean them, Misty.
                   (Starts fixing breakfast)

       COPS bang loudly on door.  MOM jumps.

                            MISTY
                  It's him!

                            MOM
                  No, honey, it's the police.
                   (Opens back door)
                  Hello, officers.

       Subtitle appears "7:10am" and then fades out.

                            DET. BRADFORD
                  Good morning, Mrs. Sutphin.

                            MISTY
                   (Subtly unbuttoning her
                    blouse one button)
                  Hi, Detective Moore.

                            DET. MOORE
                       (Embarrassed)
                  Morning, Misty.
                       (All business)
                  Mrs. Sutphin, I presume you heard
                  of the death of Mr. Stubbins.

                            MOM
                  A fine man.  A good teacher...

                            DET. BRADFORD
                       (Reading from notes)
                  Contrusions...fractures...
                  rupture of numerous vital
                  organs...

                            MOM
                       (In sympathy)
                  What a mess.

       MOM sees SCOTTY pull up in driveway with BIRDIE in
       his convertible.

                            MOM
                    (Seeing MISTY's eyes light
                     up at hearing a car)
                  No, honey, it's just Scotty.
                       (To COPS)
                  Scotty, who doesn't wear his
                  seatbelts!

        DAD and CHIP enter kitchen as BIRDIE and SCOTTY
        barge in back door.

                            DAD
                  Good morning, Detectives.

                            BIRDIE
                       (Dramatically)
                  Nightmare on Calverton Court!

                            SCOTTY
                  The Maryland Teacher Massacre!

                            DET. MOORE
                  That's not funny, son.

                            DET. BRADFORD
                  Did you drive your car to the
                  PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs.
                  Sutphin?

                            MOM
                       (Buttering toast)
                  Yes, I did.

                            DAD
                       (To cops, getting angry)
                  Detectives, what is this about?

                            DET. MOORE
                  I know this sounds weird,
                  Mr. Sutphin, but the Department
                  of Motor Vehicle's computer shows
                  only one blue station wagon
                  registered to a parent of any
                  of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.

                            DAD
                  Surely you don't think Beverly
                  was involved!

                            SCOTTY
                       (Hamming it up,
                        pointing to MOM)
                  SHE DID IT!  Aimed the car right
                  at Mr. Stubbins and mowed him
                  down!

                            MOM
                       (Quickly staring daggers at
                        SCOTTY before patiently
                        addressing COPS)
                  From what I understand, the
                  eye-witness is a drug user.

                            MISTY
                  I got somebody you could
                  run over, Mother!

                            DAD
                  Misty, that's a terrible
                  thing to say!
                    (Putting his arm
                     protectively around MOM)
                  Detectives, it's time for you
                  to leave.  My wife knows
                  nothing about this terrible
                  ...accident.

                            MOM
                       (Correcting him)
                  Murder, honey.

                            SCOTTY

                    magazine with Ivana Trump
                    on the cover)
                  Now, here's a babe!

       COPS see magazine cover with the "P" in "People" cut
       out as in threatening note sent to Mrs. Ackerman.

                            DET. MOORE
                       (Suspiciously)
                  Let's see that, young man.

                    (Whispering to BIRDIE as
                     she ogles him from behind)
                  Nice buns!

                            DET. BRADFORD
                  "P" as in...

                           MOM
                      (Glaring at SCOTTY)
                  ...People who don't mind their
                  own business.

       DAD looks at MOM suddenly, for the first time
       showing slight suspicion.

                            MOM
                       (To DAD)
                  It's Mrs. Ackerman's magazine,
                  honey.
                       (To COPS)
                  Look at the subscription label
                  if you don't believe me.
                       (Proudly)
                  I recycle my magazines.

40.    Wipe to EXTERIOR MRS. ACKERMAN'S HOUSE.

       MRS. ACKERMAN is dumping all her bottles and
       newspapers into the rest of her garbage without the
       slightest thought of recycling.  Subtitle appears
       "10:06am" and fades out.

       Cut to GUS and SLOPPY, two Baltimore County
       sanitation workers as they pick up bags of
       neighbors' recycled trash and scowl in hatred at the
       environmentally incorrect MRS. ACKERMAN.

41.    INTERIOR SUTPHIN KITCHEN.

       MOM, now alone, is happily separating her cans and
       plastic trash into proper recycle bins as she rocks
       out singing along with the Barry Manilow record
       "Daybreak" that spins on her high-fi set.

                            MOM
                      (Singing and dancing
                       in place as soulfully
                       as possible for her)
                  "It's Daybreak"
                  If you want to believe
                  It can be Daybreak!..."

       MOM looks out through her kitchen window and sees
       MRS. ACKERMAN dumping styrofoam packing chips in
       with the rest of her un-recycled garbage.  Freezing
       in horror, MOM then lunges for MRS. ACKERMAN's
       gleaming sewing scissors in borrowed sewing basket
       and begins to run out door.

       Suddenly MOM sees the friendly GARBAGEMEN waving to
       her from truck.  She quickly puts back the scissors,
       grabs her recyle bags, locates two "miniatures" of
       liquor hidden in kitchen cabinet and runs out back
       door.

42.    EXTERIOR SUTPHIN HOUSE.

       MRS. ACKERMAN goes back inside her house as MOM
       charges out to meet GARBAGEMEN with her recyclables.

                            MOM
                  Don't forget me, boys!
                       (Holding up blue bags)
                  All rinsed and ready to
                  recycle!

                            GUS
                  Morning, Mrs. Sutphin.

                            MOM
                  Morning, Gus.  Hello, Sloppy.
                    (Sneakily handing them
                     miniatures)
                  Here you go.  You work hard
                  for the environment.  A little
                  drink never hurt anybody.

                            SLOPPY
                  Thanks, ma'am.
                       (Takes a big swig)
                  Damn!  Good stuff.
                   (Looking at MRS. ACKERMAN's
                    garbage)
                  Do you believe that goddamn
                  litterbugger?

                            MOM
                       (Fingering a tin can)
                  I've told her!  It takes ninety
                  to one hundred years for a tin
                  can to decompose but she still
                  won't recycle.

                            GUS
                       (Also taking a guzzle)
                  Cost taxpayers millions of
                  dollars last year but she don't
                  care about the national budget!

                            MOM
                       (Deadly serious)
                  I HATE Mrs. Ackerman.

       "Mom's Psycho Theme" begins building on soundtrack.

                            GUS
                    (Drinking, encouraging her)
                  I hate her too.

                   (Getting tipsy, joining
                    the bull session)
                  I HATE HER GUTS!
                   (Egging MOM on, laughing)
                  Somebody ought to kill her!

                            GUS
                       (Joking and drinking)
                  Yeah, hack her up and recycle
                  her!

                            MOM
                       (Not kidding, in a trance)
                  For the sake of this planet,
                  SOMEBODY JUST MIGHT!

       "Mom's Psycho Theme" climaxes on soundtrack.

43.    INTERIOR ROSEMARY ACKERMAN'S HOUSE.

       MRS. ACKERMAN is serving brunch to DOTTIE HINKLE as
       they drink beer together and watch "The Joan Rivers
       Show" on TV as JOAN interviews a fat woman in her
       20's.

                            JOAN

                            HAG
                  I don't judge him.

       TV audience groans.

                            JOAN
                  How can you love a
                  mass-murderer?

                            HAG
                  Easy!  He's handsome.  He's
                  famous.  AND WE GET CONJUGAL

                            DOTTIE
                  Turn it off.

       MRS. ACKERMAN does.

                  Violence is everywhere these
                  days

44.    EXTERIOR MRS. ACKERMAN'S HOUSE.

       MOM runs up to window in a frenzy and freezes at the
       sight of DOTTIE HINKLE inside.

45.    INTERIOR MRS. ACKERMAN'S HOUSE.

       DOTTIE looks over and sees MOM in window and
       screams.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                       (Looking up)
                  Oh, it's just Beverly.

                            DOTTIE
                  She scared me.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                       (Going to door)
                  Come in, Beverly.  Have some
                  coffee

                            MOM
                   (Entering, back to normal,
                    being so-o-o-o nice)
                  Just a half-a-cup.
                       (To DOTTIE)
                  Hello, Dottie.  I'm so sorry
                  to hear of your troubles...

                            DOTTIE
                  It's not fair!!

                            MOM
                   (To MRS. ACKERMAN, noticing
                    her flower arrangement)
                  Are those pussy-willows?

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                     (Fixing the coffee)
                  Dried ones.  Aren't they pretty?

       DOTTIE freezes in horror when she recognizes the
       P-word in MOM's voice.

                            DOTTIE
                       (Alarmed)
                  What did you just say?

                  (Evily baiting DOTTIE under
                   her breath)
                  PUSSY-willows, Dottie!

       MOM purposely knocks MRS. ACKERMAN's Franklin Mint
       Faberge Egg off table and sends it crashing to the
       floor.

                            MOM
                  Dottie!  Watch what you're
                  doing!

                       (Horrified to see MOM
                        is blaming her)

                  Dottie didn't mean to be a
                  clumsy ox.  She's sorry,
                  Aren't you, Dottie?

                  Rosemary, I didn't break your
                  egg - she did!

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  You could at least apologize,
                  Dottie.  I collect Franklin Mint!

                            MOM
                  And we're going right to the
                  flea market to get another one!
                  Misty tells me there's a whole
                  booth of Franklin Mint stuff.
                  Dottie, you lock up.
                       (Evily)

                  But...but...she...Rosemary, I
                  heard her voice!  It's her, I
                  tell you, IT'S HER!

46.    INTERIOR DAD'S DENTAL EXAMINATION ROOM.

       DAD attempts to do dental work on RALPH STERNER, the
       "emergency" patient who lets out a blood curdling
       scream every time DAD gets the drill anywhere near
       his mouth.

                            DAD
                  Mr. Sterner, you've lost a tiny
                  filling.  I have to drill deeply
                  enough to remove all the decay.

                            MR. STERNER
                       (Whimpering)
                  Alright...go ahead...but be
                  careful, it really hurts!
                       (Opens mouth)

       DAD begins to drill again.

                            MR. STERNER
                  OWWWWW'! Goddamn you!  You're
                  hurting me on purpose!

47.    DENTAL WAITING ROOM.

       MRS. STERNER, reading an old issue of Newsweek, with

                  I'm sure those are my son,
                  Chip's books.

                            DET. MOORE
                  No, they're your wife's.  We
                  checked,  She bought them
                  down at "The Browse and Learn

                        of MOM are serious)

       Cut to MOM's face, seemingly in the middle of a

       Camera pulls back and we see that she is swatting
       away a persistent bee as she sits with MISTY at her

                        (Walks away)

                            MISTY
                  Thanks for not buying anything!

                            MOM
                  Misty, lighten up.  It's not
                  the customer's fault Carl stood
                  you up!

       MOM looks over two rows and sees CARL walking
       through the flea market with a SEXPOT DATE.  Her
       face turns to stone but she doesn't let on to MISTY.

       Cut to MRS. ACKERMAN shopping passionately at the
       nearby Franklin Mint booth.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                       (To VENDOR)
                  Young man, this Faberge Egg is
                  chipped.

                            VENDOR
                  Yes, ma'am, it is.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  I'll give you fifty cents.

                            VENDOR
                  That's a Franklin Mint piece.
                  Eight dollars.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  Eight dollars?!  Franklin Mint
                  or not, it's damaged goods!
                       (Puts it back)

       MRS. ACKERMAN bends over grumbling and sees a fire
       poker marked with a price tag of $6.O0.  Sneakily
       she switches price tag of $3.00 from another item.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  I'll take this instead.

                            VENDOR
                  Nice one, huh?  Winter's coming.
                       (Looking at price
                        momentarily hesit'ating)
                  Three dollars?...I guess that's
                  what I marked it...

       MRS. ACKERMAN smirks and pays him.

       MRS. ACKERMAN comes back to MISTY's booth carrying
       fire poker.

                            MOM
                  (Seeing MRS. ACKERMAN1s
                   purchase, but still watching
                   CARL and SEXPOT DATE in distance)
                  Did you find your Franklin Mint
                  egg, Rosemary darling?

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  I saw one, but it was ridiculously
                  overpriced!

                            MOM
                       (Seeing MRS. ACKERMAN's
                        fire poker)
                  You want me to keep that under
                  the table for you?

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  If you wouldn't mind...
                       (Gives it to her)
                  It was on sale.

       Cut to CARL browsing at same Franklin Mint booth
       that MRS. ACKERMAN was shopping in earlier.  SEXPOT
       DATE is drooling over chipped Faberge Egg and
       batting her eyes at CARL.

                            SEXPOT DATE
                       (In baby talk)
                  Honey, pleeease?  For my little
                  knick-knack shelf?

                            CARL
                       (To VENDOR)
                  Wrap it up for the little
                  lady.

       Cut to MOM with the fire poker partially concealed
       under her coat as she stalks CARL and SEXPOT DATE to
       baseball memorabilia booth.  MOM pretends to shop
       nearby as CARL buys Oriole penant for himself.

       MOM follows them to concession stand where CARL
       excuses himself for a quick trip to the men's room.
       SEXPOT DATE adjusts her cleavage as she waits, much
       to the embarrassment of YOUNG BOY walking by.

       Realizing the coast is clear, MOM darts into men's
       room following CARL.

51.    INTERIOR MEN'S ROOM.

       CARL is at urinal.  Subtitle appears "11:57am" and
       fades out.  MOM rushes in unnoticed and tries to
       enter first booth and finds it locked,  She scurries
       to next booth and enters.

       A male PERVERT in locked booth is drawing dirty
       pictures on the wall.  He looks down and sees MOM's
       shoes under the stall and starts moaning sexually as
       he writes "EAT ME" with a magic marker.

       Closeup of CARL's face as he pisses like a
       racehorse.

       PERVERT looks through peep-hole between booths and
       sees MOM and moans in silent orgasm.

       MOM pulls fire poker out from under her coat.

       PERVERT zips up in a panic and flees bathroom in
       fear.

       Suddenly MOM runs from her booth with fire poker
       drawn and skewers CARL in the back at the urinal.

       CARL screams in horror as MOM pulls out fire poker
       with his liver skewered on the end.

       CARL collapses to his knees, his head landing in
       urinal.

       MOM looks horrified at the liver and tries to shake
       it off poker, panicked that someone will come into
       men's room.

       Closing her eyes in revulsion, she pulls off liver
       with her fingertips and throws it on floor.

       Running from men's room, she slips in gore, catches
       her balance, looks back at CARL's head in urinal,
       hesitates and finally runs back to flush toilet
       before escaping undetected.

52.    MISTY'S FLEA MARKET TABLE.

       A hip young couple are buying a hideous amateur oil
       painting of Don Knotts from MISTY.

                            BOY
                  I can't believe it!  Fuckin'
                  Don Knotts!

                            GIRL
                       (Happily)
                  It's beyond ugly!

                            MISTY
                     (Giving them back change)
                  There you go...

       Cut to MOM approaching, looking happy and composed
       with fire poker concealed under her coat.

                            MOM
                       (Calling out)
                  Misty, honey, look!
                   (Holding up a set of
                    cereal bowls)
                  I made a killing!

53.    INTERIOR MEN'S ROOM.

       A MACHO MAN enters nibbling lamb off a shishkobab.
       He sees CARL's body and screams in the best Fay Ray
       tradition.  Subtitle appears "l2:llpm" and then
       fades out.

54.    MISTY'S FLEA MARKET TABLE.

       MOM is showing MISTY her new cereal bowl as MRS.
       ACKERMAN returns.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                       (Upset)
                  I went back to get my Faberge
                  Egg and some idiot bought it!

       Sirens are heard in the distance.

                            MOM
                    (Caressing fire poker
                     back under table,
                     threateningly)
                  It's just not your day, is
                  it Rosemary?

                           MISTY
                   (Seeing cop cars and
                    ambulance enter flea market
                    as customers start running
                    towards concession stand)
                  Watch the booth!  I'll be back!
                   (Runs off to join the crowd)

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                      (Spotting a small hunk
                       of gore stuck to bottom
                       of MOM's shoe)
                  Beverly, honey, you've got some...
                       (Wrinkles up her nose)
                  ...do-do on your shoe.

                            MOM
                  Ewwww!
                       (Wipes it off on grass)
                  Thank you, Rosemary.

       MRS. ACKERMAN notices stain with odd unease.

55.    EXTERIOR CONCESSION STAND.

       COPS are holding back CARL'S sobbing and hysterical
       SEXPOT DATE as she clutches her Faberge Egg while
       PARAMEDICS remove CARL'S body from the mens room on
       a stretcher.

       DET. MOORE and BRADFORD are roughly frisking
       bathroom PERVERT.

                            PERVERT
                  There was a lady in the men's
                  room!  I swear! A pretty little
                  lady in the stall right next
                  to me!

       MISTY pushes her way through rubbernecking crowd
       until she finally sees CARL'S face right before the
       PARAMEDICS give the final zip to the body bag.  She
       lets out a blood-curdling scream.

       DET. BRADFORD looks up into MISTY's horror filled
       face and turns in suspicion to DET. MOORE only to
       see his partner making eyes with SEXPOT DATE, who in
       between sobs, is flirting back with all her might.

56.    MISTY'S BOOTH.

       MRS. ACKERMAN is looking in revulsion at what
       appears to be dried blood on the end of her
       fire-poker stored under the flea market table as MOM
       happily sells Pee-Wee Herman doll to New York
       dealer.

                            MOM
                  That's one-hundred fifty-eight
                  dollars.

                            DEALER
                  Will you take a New York check?

                            MOM
                  Certainly.

       MRS. ACKERMAN reaches down and touches the end of
       fire poker and almost faints when she sees red on
       her fingertips.

       MISTY hysterically returns to booth, crying and
       screaming.

                            MISTY
                  Mother!  It's Carl!
                  He's dead!

       MRS. ACKERMAN looks in sudden fear at MOM.

                            MOM
                  0h, that's horrible, honey.
                       (Suddenly cheerful)
                  I sold the Pee-Wee Herman
                  doll!!

                            MISTY
                       (Appalled)
                  Mother!  Did you hear me?!
                  Someone murdered Carl in the
                  mensroom!  I saw his dead body!

                            MOM
                       (Quietly, sweetly)
                  You got your wish.

                            MISTY
                       (Stunned)
                  But...
                       (Backs away)
                  I didn't wish...I didn't
                  want him DEAD!

       MRS. ACKERMAN gulps in horror.

57.    INTERIOR MOM'S BEDROOM.

       DAD is frantically searching through MOM's stuff and
       finds a scrapbook which is filled page after page
       with newspaper clippings about famous mass
       murderers.  He gasps in horror and then looks
       between mattress and box-springs and finds a stack
       of letters and a few cassette tapes.  He looks in
       shock at return address of first letter - "Richard
       Speck, Statesville Correctional Center, Joliet,
       Illinois 60434".  He tears open envelope and out
       falls an 8xlO glossy photo of a naked Richard Speck
       with the inscription "To Beverly.  Love, Richard
       Speck".  Shaking his head in horror, DAD puts
       cassette in tape player and pushes play button.  The
       voice on the tape booms out in bedroom, "Beverly,
       it's me, Ted Bundy.  It's late at night six days
       before my execution and it's lonely here on death
       row...".  DAD lunges for machine to push OFF button
       and accidentally turns on the radio.

                            NEWS ANNOUNCER
                  ...Updating the top story of
                  the hour, the young man brutally
                  murdered a short time ago in the
                  mens room of the Edmonson Flea
                  Market has been identified as
                  22 year old Carl Padgett of
                  Towson...

       DAD slams down OFF button on radio and sobs in
       shock.

58.    INTERIOR "SUBURBAN CULT VIDEO SHOP".

       CHIP1 on duty as manager, along with BIRDIE and
       SCOTTY and a few other horror-nut customers watch on
       large video monitor Joan Crawford get off a train in
       William Castle's "Straight Jacket".  The suspense
       builds as Joan on video spies through a window at
       her husband with another woman, picks up an ax and
       cuts off his head.  Suddenly MISTY runs into video
       shop in hysterics.

                            MISTY
                  Chip!  Our mother is Charles
                  Manson!

       All the kids laugh uproarously as Joan screams on
       video "I'm not guilty" while struggling in a
       straight jacket.

                            MISTY
                   (Grabbing the remote and
                    turning off the video)
                       (To CHIP)
                  I'm not kidding.  Carl stood
                  me up this morning and then
                  he was murdered at the flea
                  market....

                            CHIP
                  MURDERED?!!

                            MISTY
                  Yes murdered!  You said you
                  hated your teacher yesterday
                  and he was murdered too.  I
                  don't know...maybe Mom's nuts!

                            CHIP
                  It's a cool idea, Misty!
                  Let's make a gore movie about
                  Mom!  Better yet, a TV series!

                            BIRDIE
                  Can I borrow your mother?
                  My aunt is coming over to dinner
                  tonight and she's always on my
                  nerves.

                            KID
                  My step-father is an asshole!
                  She could kill him!

                            CHIP
                       (Baiting MISTY)
                  How about Mrs. Ackerman?
                  We both hate her!
                       (Playfully)
                  Should she be the next victim?

                            MISTY
                  No!  Stop it!  It's not funny.
                  Mom might do it!
                       (Sobbing)
                  Someone else might die.

                            SCOTTY
                       (Comforting her)
                  I believe you, Misty.
                  Your mother could kill - I've
                  seen that look in her eyes!
                           (Timidly)
                  Is there a reward or anything?

59.    DISSOLVE TO INTERIOR SUTPHIN DINING ROOM.

       MOM comes through kitchen door and serves a fancy
       tuna casserole.

                            MOM
                  Dinner's served!

       Subtitle appears "6:01pm" and then fades out.

       MISTY looks at her mother in terror.  DAD treats MOM
       with kid gloves.  CHIP is completely oblivious to
       their concern.

                            DAD
                  Let's say grace and pray
                  that we have the strength to
                  understand the terrible
                  tragedies of the last few days.

                            MOM
                  Amen to that.
                       (Happily)
                  It's been a crazy day, hasn't it?!

       MISTY pales, DAD looks at MOM in fear.

60.    MRS. ACKERMAN'S LIVING ROOM.

       DET. MOORE and several other COPS are taking down
       every word MRS. ACKERMAN says in notebooks and on
       tape recorders.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  ...Dottie Hinkle was right - IT
                  IS BEVERLY SUTPHIN!  I tell you
                  I saw blood right on the bottom
                  of her shoes!  Not exactly blood
                  - it was GORE!  Hanging right
                  there like a runny nose!!

61.    INTERIOR DOTTIE HINKLE'S LIVING ROOM.

       DET. BRADFORD and several other POLICE OFFICERS are
       taking her statement and trying to calm her down,

                            DOTTIE
                  Nice as pie she was to me and
                  then I hear her say it!

                            DET. BRADFORD
                  Say what, ma'am?

                            DOTTIE
                  "Are those..."
                       (Giving up)
                  I can't say the word out loud.

                            DET. BRADFORD
                     (Trying to comfort her)
                  Could you tell a policewoman
                  the exact words she used?
         
                            DOTTIE
                       (Being pitiful)
                  Maybe...

       A huge galute of a POLICEWOMAN sits next to DOTTIE
       and pats her hand.

                            POLICEWOMAN
                  It's ok...nobody's gonna
                  hurt you.
                       (Whispering)
                  Come on, let it out...

                            DOTTIE
                    (Yelling loudly, startling
                     all the cops in the room)
                  "PUSSY" she says to me!
                  "PUSSY WILLOWS!"

62.    INTERIOR SUTPHIN DINING ROOM.

       The family is eating in uneasy silence.
         
                            CHIP
                       (Excited, happy)
                  You know Mom, Scotty thinks
                  you're the killer!

       MISTY chokes on her food, DAD laughs unconvincingly.

                            MOM
                       (Laughs)
                  Does he?
                       (Smiling to CHIP)
                  For a boy who doesn't wear
                  seat belts, Scotty's awfully
                  nosy.
                       (Getting up)
                  Excuse me a second.
                       (Exits into kitchen)

       The whole family sits in awkward silence.

63.    EXTERIOR SUTPHIN HOUSE.

       ROOKIE COP sits in cop car on surveillance duty
       watching the Sutphin house in eery silence.

64.    SUTPHIN DINING ROOM.

       Family is squirming in their seats in nervous
       silence.  MISTY suddenly bolts from table and runs
       towards kitchen.

65.    SUTPHIN KITCHEN.

       MISTY runs in.  No one is there.  On blackboard,
       written in chalk is "WENT TO THE 7-il, MOM".

                            MISTY
                  She's gone!

       CHIP and DAD rush in.

                            MISTY
                       (Blurting it out)
                  She's gonna kill Scotty!

                            DAD
                       (No longer pretending)
                  BOTH OF YOU!  GET IN THE CAR!

                            CHIP
                       (Horrified)
                  DAD!  YOU DON'T THINK SHE
                  DID IT??!

                            MISTY
                  I DO!  Mom's gone crazy!

                            DAD
                       (To CHIP)
                  Your mother may have some
                  problems, that's all, Chip.
                       (To both)
                  C'mon!  Hurry!

66.    EXTERIOR SUTPHINS.

       MOM peels out in her station wagon like a bat out of
       hell.

       ROOKIE COP looks up in shock, clumsily throws the
       car in gear and takes off behind her.  Subtitle
       appears "6:36pm" and then fades out.

67.    INTERIOR MOM'S STATION WAGON.

       MOM is driving like a lunatic,  She sees the red
       light of pursuing police car in rear-view mirror and
       floors it as she hits play button of tape deck in
       car and begins singing along loudly and scarily to
       her favorite song, Barry Manilow's "Daybreak",

                            MOM
                  "...Ain't no time to grieve
                  And it's Daybreak!!!
                  Let it shine, shine, shine,
                  All around the world!!"

68.    INTERIOR COP CAR.

       ROOKIE COP is sweating bullets speeding after MOM's
       car and grabs police radio.

                            ROOKIE
                  MAY DAY!! MAY DAY!!

69.    INTERIOR MOM'S CAR.

       MOM is "dancing" in place and gyrating to the beat
       as she belts out the finale of "Daybreak" and
       suddenly turns the steering wheel violently to the
       right.

70.    EXTERIOR MRS. HINKLE'S HOUSE.

       MOM's car veers across lawn and flattens Mrs.
       Hinkle's entire flower garden as she plows her way
       back to street.

       DET. BRADFORD comes running out of house and jumps
       out of way as ROOKIE COP's car skids around corner
       and smashes into Mrs. Ackerman's wishing well
       decoration in her front yard.

       DOTTIE HINKLE is held back by burly POLICEWOMAN on
       porch as she curses MOM in the distance.

                            DOTTIE
                  You rotten mother-fucker!
                  You lousy cock-sucker!

71.    INTERIOR DAD'S CAR.

       DAD is at the wheel driving with MISTY in front and
       CHIP in the back.

                            MISTY
                       (To DAD)
                  Turn right on Timonioum Road.
                  Hurry, Dad!

                            CHIP
                   (Scared for the first time)
                  If Mom's a psycho, Scotty will
                  still be ok, won't he?

                            DAD
                  We hope so, son.  And no matter
                  what your mother is, we'll love
                  her anyway.

72.    INTERIOR DETECTIVE MOORE'S CAR.

                            DET. MOORE
                       (Following the Sutphins,
                        into police radio mike)
                  Suspect's family is headed east
                  on Calverton....

73.    INTERIOR MOM'S CAR.

       MOM turns off tape player and pulls to a stop on a
       quiet suburban street.  She fixes her hair in rear
       view mirror, smiles, then takes out rubber
       dish-washing gloves and slips them on her hands.

74.    INTERIOR SCOTTY'S BEDROOM AT HIS PARENTS' HOUSE.

       SCOTTY lies in bed, surrounded by vintage
       sexploitation movie posters that decorate his walls
       ("Garden of Eden", "Mud-Honey", "There She Blows"),
       and watches on video the ridiculous 70's trash film
       "Double-Agent '73" starring Chesty Morgan.

       In the credit sequence he sees Miss Morgan
       "photographing" men with her humongous breasts that
       supposedly have cameras implanted inside.  SCOTTY is
       getting turned on.  He runs to lock bedroom door,
       closes curtain on window and then hops under a
       blanket to commit the sin of self-abuse.

75.    EXTERIOR SCOTTY'S PARENTS' HOUSE.

       DAD, MISTY and CHIP pull up, run to front door and
       pound on it.

       DETECTIVE MOORE pulls up at a safe distance behind
       them and watches from police car.  Subtitle appears
       "7:01pm" and disappears.

76.    INTERIOR SCOTTY'S BEDROOM.

       SCOTTY is watching Chesty Morgan on video roll about
       in hideous hot pants and insane 1970's platform
       shoes as he concentrates on her gigantic breasts and
       touches himself off camera.  He hears banging at
       door, curses whoever it is, and decides to ignore
       them.

77.    EXTERIOR SCOTTY'S PARENTS' HOUSE.

       DAD jiggles the door unsuccessfully until CHIP
       slithers through an open window and lets MISTY and
       DAD inside.

78.    INTERIOR DETECTIVE MOORE'S POLICE CAR.

                            DET. BRADFORD.
                       (Into police radio mike)
                  Suspect's family is entering
                  house.  Send backup to 2l14
                  Sycamore Street. I've got a
                  feeling old Mom's inside.  I'm
                  goin' in!

       Heroic music blares on soundtrack as he leaps from
       car and pulls gun.  Subtitle appears "7:24pm" and
       then fades out.

79.    CUT to MOM staring evily through plate glass window
       from outside a suburban house.

       Reverse angle shows not Scotty, but the dental
       emergency couple, THE STERNERS, as they sit in their
       dining room eating a dinner of cornish game hens.

       MOM zeros in on the game hens and flashes back to
       "Dede" and the other cute birds in her bird-feeder
       at home.

       As the couple viciously slice apart the game hens
       and stuff the meat in their mouths, MOM breaks a
       small pane of glass in back door to gain entry.

                            MRS. STERNER
                  What was that?

                            MR. STERNER
                  I didn't hear anything.
                  Got any dessert?

                            MRS. STERNER
                  Dr. Sutphin said no sweets
                  for you.

                            MR. STERNER
                  What's he know?

                            MRS. STERNER
                  How to send a bill!!

       They both laugh uproarously at her bad joke.

80.    STERNER KITCHEN.

       MOM is listening in disgust, notices a limp plant,
       waters it thoughtfully and then jumps out of the way
       to hide as MRS. STERNER comes into kitchen to get a
       large chocolate pie.

81.    INTERIOR SCOTTY'S BEDROOM.

       SCOTTY has the whole bed vibrating noisily as he
       watches Chesty Morgan on video in hideous green
       plaid bell bottoms as she "photographs" evidence
       with her breasts.

82.    INTERIOR SCOTTY'S PARENTS' HOUSE.  HALLWAY.

       DAD, MISTY and CHIP creep up the steps towards
       SCOTTY's bedroom.

83.    EXTERIOR SCOTTY'S PARENTS' HOUSE.

       DET. BRADFORD signals the newly arrived DET. MOORE
       and a small swat team in battle gear to follow him
       quietly to Scotty's front door.

84.    INTERIOR STERNER'S DINING ROOM.

       MR. STERNER cuts himself a second piece of chocolate
       pie and pigs it down.

85.    INTERIOR STERNER'S BEDROOM.

                            MRS. STERNER
                       (Yelling downstairs)
                  Ralph, "Wheel of Fortune"'s
                  on!!

       As MRS. STERNER continues to watch TV we see her get
       ready for bed.

       We see her change from her shoes to bedroom slippers
       from under the bed.

       We see her brush her hair from behind the mirror.

       We see her open her drawer and take out
       birth-control foam from inside the bureau.

       We see her go to closed curtains moving ominously in
       the breeze and close the window from the other side.

                            MRS. STERNER
                       (Calling out)
                  Ralph, you're missing it!

       MRS. STERNER takes off her dress to reveal monstrous
       white all-in-one bra and girdle and moves to closet
       door.

       She opens closet door and hesitates.

       We see shoe in bottom of closet move slightly.

       Suddenly a mouse scurries out of shoe and runs
       across floor as MRS. STERNER screams,

86.    STERNER DINING ROOM.

                            MR. STERNER
                    (As chocolate oozes in his
                     mouth)
                  What is it, Betty?

87.    STERNER BEDROOM.

                            MRS. STERNER
                       (Still shaking)
                  We have mice!  I mean it,
                  Ralph!  I saw one!

       MRS. STERNER reaches for nightgown and pulls it off
       hanger to reveal MOM's insane face.  Suddenly MOM
       stabs MRS. STERNER viciously in the stomach with
       MRS. ACKERMAN's scissors.

                            MOM
                       (Scarily)
                  Always brush after every meal!

       MRS. STERNER opens her mouth in a silent scream as
       MOM pulls out the scissors and stabs her again and
       again as a large rat in the closet runs out and
       begins biting MRS. STERNER's ankle at the same time.

88.    STERNER DINING ROOM.

       MR. STERNER burps in front of empty plate and hears
       loud thud from upstairs.  He gets up from table.

                            MR. STERNER
                       (Calling upstairs)
                  Betty?

89.    STERNER BEDROOM.

       MRS. STERNER is dead on the floor with scissors
       sticking out of her as MOM attempts to clean up the
       blood with the household product, "SHOUT".

90.    HALLWAY STERNER HOUSE.

       MR. STERNER runs up stairs, suddenly alarmed.

                            MR. STERNER
                  Betty?  Betty, answer me!

91.    STERNER BEDROOM

       MOM looks up from cleaning and smiles as MR. STERNER
       runs in, sees the grisly sight and screams in
       horror.

                            MOM
                     (Holding up bottle of "SHOUT"
                      and doing mock TV-ad)
                  "SHOUT IT OUT".

       MOM suddenly pulls scissors out of MRS. STERNER's
       stomach and expertly throws them like a knife at MR.
       STERNER's head.  He ducks in the nick of time and
       the scissors stick in the wall.

       MR. STERNER turns and runs in fear as MOM gives
       chase, grabbing the scissors out of the wall.

92.    HALLWAY.  STERNER HOUSE.

       MR. STERNER runs down the steps screaming as MOM
       runs after him.  She throws the scissors at him
       again, but just misses him.

       Thinking fast, MR. STERNER grabs scissors from wall
       and throws them back at MOM.  She ducks in the nick
       of time and her face goes purple with rage.

                            MOM
                  You'll pay for that, Ralph
                  Sterner!!

       As MR. STERNER runs to back door, MOM charges back
       up the steps to bedroom.

93.    STERNER BEDROOM.

       MOM rushes in and watches MR. STERNER from above
       from bedroom window as he runs out of house.

94.    STERNER LAWN.

       MR. STERNER runs across lawn screaming.

                            MR. STERNER
                  Help!  POLICE!!

95.    STERNER BEDROOM.

       MOM is rocking air conditioner in window back and
       forth until she gets it loose.  Seeing him right
       below, MOM shoves it out window with all her might.

96.    STERNER LAWN.

       MR. STERNER looks up at air conditioner falling from
       above and screams the second before he is crushed
       like an insect.

97.    SCOTTY'S BEDROOM.

       SCOTTY is moaning in orgasm as he watches ludicrous
       Chesty Morgan "Secret Agent" breast footage on video
       screen.

98.    OUTSIDE SCOTTY'S BEDROOM DOOR.

       DAD, MISTY and CHIP look at one another in horror
       thinking SCOTTY's moans are cries of pain and they
       break down his door to save him.

99.    SCOTTY'S BEDROOM.

       SCOTTY stares in complete mortification as the
       Sutphin family catch him in the middle of an orgasm.

       When DETECTIVES MOORE and BRADFORD and their
       ridiculously overprepared SWAT TEAM flood the
       bedroom, screaming "FREEZE" and "HANDS OVER YOUR
       HEAD", SCOTTY fumes in anger as MISTY and CHIP
       giggle in relief and DAD turns red in embarrassment.

100.   Wipe to EXTERIOR SUTPHIN HOUSE.

       DAD's car pulls up and the relieved Sutphin family
       hops out and runs to house.  Subtitle appears
       "9:02pm" and fades out.

                            DAD
                  Home Sweet Home!  Everything's
                  fine, kids!

                            MISTY
                       (Laughing)
                  I can't believe I thought my
                  own mother was a murderess!

                            CHIP
                  I'm disappointed she isn't!
                       (In wonder)
                  For a while there, it was like
                  being in a movie!

101.   SUTPHIN DINING ROOM.

       MOM is seated happily at table.  DAD, MISTY and CHIP
       enter.

                            MOM
                       (Beaming happily)
                  Anybody for dessert?
                  M-m-m-m-m, strawberries!

       Fade to black.

102.   Fade in to ST. TIMOTHY'S EPISCOPAL CHURCH.

       Sign out front announces the service: "11:00am.
       Holy Eucharist Service.  Sermon: 'Capitol Punishment
       and You'".  Families stream into church.  Subtitle
       appears "10:37am, Sunday September 20th" and fades
       out.

103.   EXTERIOR SUTPHIN HOUSE.

       MOM, DAD, CHIP and MISTY walk out front door dressed
       in their Sunday finest.  Suddenly their wholesome
       smiles freeze on their faces.

       Cop cars are everywhere watching MOM's every move.
       DETECTIVES MOORE and BRADFORD smile hatefully at
       MOM, pressuring her with their high-visibility
       surveillance.

       The family nervously gets in their car and DAD turns
       the ignition.

       Cop after cop after cop start up their engines.

       As DAD pulls out of the driveway in his car the cops
       file into a procession of intimidation behind him.

104.   INTERIOR DET. MOORE AND DET. BRADFORDS' CAR.

                            DET. BRADFORD
                       (Talking into police radio)
                  ...Sutphin family proceeding west
                  on Seminary Avenue.  Beverly ain't
                  goin' nowhere this time.

105.   INTERIOR SUTPHIN CAR.

                            MISTY
                       (Scared)
                  Dad, I thought it was ok.
                  Make them go away.  This is
                  embarrassing.

                            DAD
                  Just ignore the police.
                  It's all a terrible mistake.

       He turns on radio to music.

                            CHIP
                  Think we'll get on "A
                  CURRENT AFFAIR"?

106.   INTERIOR DET. MOORE AND BRADFORD'S CAR.

                            DET. MOORE
                  She's headed for church.

                            DET. BRADFORD
                   (To police dispatcher on radio)
                  I say we nail her!

                            DISPATCHER
                       (On radio)
                  Negative.  D.A. says no bust
                  until lab report is back matching
                  suspect's fingerprints on true-crime
                  book with those on scissors and
                  fire poker.

                            DET. BRADFORD
                       (To DET. MOORE)
                  She may be Beaver Cleaver's
                  mother...but Jim Jones and the
                  entire People's Temple just
                  fucked her!

107.   INTERIOR SUTPHIN CAR.

       MISTY, CHIP and DAD listen in appalled silence to
       news report on radio as MOM seems unfazed.

                            ANNOUNCER
                  ...the senseless killing last
                  night of Towson couple, Ralph
                  and Betty Sterner, brings to a
                  total of four murders police
                  feel may have been committed by
                  Baltimore's first serial killer...

       DAD looks at MOM in stunned disbelief.

                            DAD
                  Beverly!  Not the Sterners!

                            MOM
                       (Calmly)
                  It's a shame.  But they should
                  brush their teeth, honey.

                            ANNOUNCER
                       (On radio)
                  This just came in.  Police
                  Lieutenant Ronald Habbler has
                  publicly named a suspect in the
                  serial killer case and it's a
                  shocker!  She, that's right, she
                  has been identified as Beverly R.
                  Sutphin of 2815 Calverton Court...

                            MISTY
                  Oh God!
                       (In despair)
                  Now I'll never get a boyfriend!

                            DAD
                       (Nervously)
                  Beverly, I've been reading all
                  about it...is it menopause?

                            MOM
                  Oh, honey!

                            CHIP
                  Tell me the truth, Mom!
                  It's ok with me, really!  Are
                  you a serial killer?

                            MOM
                  Chip, the only cereal I know
                  about is Rice Krispies.

       Sutphin car pulls to a stop at a red light next to
       car full of churchgoers.  MOM turns to smile at them
       and all the churchgoers scream in horror at the
       sight of her face.

                            DAD
                       (Lovingly, painfully)
                  Don't worry, Beverly.  We're
                  going to get you good psychiatric
                  help.

108.   EXTERIOR ST. TIMOTHY'S EPISCOPAL CHURCH.

       MRS. ACKERMAN and MRS. HINKLE look up in amazement
       as they see the Sutphins pull into church parking
       lot followed by string of police cars.

       The Sutphins nervously get out of car and walk
       towards church as the good Christian families glare
       at them and gossip with a vengeance.

       DAD tries to be brave, MISTY hangs her head in
       mortification, CHIP is excited by all the attention
       and MOM smiles happily to appalled worshippers.

       GUS and SLOPPY, the two garbagemen, dressed in their
       shabby church clothes wave to MOM in secret
       admiration.

       BIRDIE's eyes light up at seeing CHIP but her
       suddenly forbidding parents hold her back when she
       tries to join him.  She mouths "I love you" to him
       as CHIP looks back to her parents with hurt and
       confusion.

       As the SUTPHIN family reaches the church door, a
       reporter runs towards them with his cameras drawn.

                            REPORTER
                       (To MOM)
                  So, Mrs. Sutphin!  Tell me!
                  Are you "Serial Mom"?

                            MOM
                  Who?

                            DAD
                   (Blocking his face from
                    strobing flash)
                  No comment!

                            CHIP
                      (To himself)
                  "Serial Mom"?
                   (He looks at his MOM who is
                    perversely enjoying the
                    attention)
                  WOW!

       MISTY, who can't help but notice that the REPORTER
       is strikingly handsome, gives him an obviously
       flirtatious smile before DAD yanks her into church
       with the rest of them.

109.   INTERIOR ST. TIMOTHY'S CHURCH.

       FATHER STONE, a mild and kind looking Episcopal
       priest has just begun the service.

                            FATHER STONE
                       (On altar)
                  Blessed be God, Father, Son and
                  Holy Spirit...

                            ALL
                  And blessed be His kingdom, now
                  and forever.  Amen...

       The SUTPHINS take their place in a half filled pew
       next to appalled young MARRIED COUPLE as a still
       mortified SCOTTY glares in hatred and vengeance from
       a pew in the back of the church.

       BIRDIE's face is covered in tears as she sits with
       her parents helplessly.

       MISTY turns in her seat and searches the hostile
       crowd for the face of the cute REPORTER.  When she
       spots him secretly snapping her photo, she subtly
       gives him a sexy pose.

110.   EXTERIOR CHURCH.

       DETECTIVES MOORE and BRADFORD wait with other COPS
       outside their cars as voice comes over police radio.

                            CAPTAIN JOHNSON
                  This is Captain Johnson from
                  Homicide.  Lab reports confirm
                  Sutphin latent print of index
                  finger on true-crime book matches
                  those latent prints lifted from
                  murder weapons.  Bingo, boys!
                  Bust the bitch!
         
       COPS smile in silent victory as they immediately
       spread out and approach the church.

111.   INTERIOR CHURCH.

       FATHER STONE is giving the sermon in a kindly tone.

                            FATHER STONE
                  ...Jesus said nothing to condemn
                  capital punishment as he hung on
                  the cross, did He?!

       MRS. ACKERMAN and MRS. HINKLE nod in pious
       agreement.

                            FATHER STONE
                  ...If ever there was a time to
                  go on record against the death
                  penalty, WASN'T IT THAT NIGHT?!...

       DAD gulps and lovingly takes MOM's hand as MISTY and
       CHIP look at one another appalled while MOM
       continues her defiant smile.

                            FATHER STONE
                  CAPITAL PUNISHMENT is already the
                  LAW in the State of Maryland!...

       DETECTIVES MOORE and BRADFORD and all the COPS begin
       infiltrating the church, taking places in pews and
       then moving forward to other pews closer to MOM.

       SCOTTY beams at police presence and eagerly scoots
       over to let DET. BRADFORD and DET. MOORE sit with
       him on their way to nail MOM.

       GUS and SLOPPY, the garbagemen, scowl at the police
       and look with loyalty to poor MOM.

                            FATHER STONE
                  ...SO WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR,
                  FELLOW CHRISTIANS?!  LET'S JUST
                  DO IT!!

                            ALL
                  AMEN!

                            FATHER STONE
                  Now, let us pray and humbly
                  confess our sins unto Almighty
                  God.

       As CONGREGATION prays along with FATHER STONE, COPS
       flood the church and move towards MOM.

                            CONGREGATION
                  ...Most merciful God, we confess
                  that we have sinned against thee...

                            CHIP and MISTY
                  ...by what we have done...

                            BIRDIE & PARENTS
                  ...and by what we have left undone...

                            DAD
                  ...we are truly sorry and we
                  humbly repent...

                            MOM
                   (Praying piously, but beginning
                     to sniffle a sneeze)
                  ...so that we may delight in thy
                  will...

       A BABY in the arms of a MOTHER in pew in front of
       MOM stares back at MOM.

                            MOM
                  ...And walk in the ways to
                  the glory...
                   (Starts to sneeze and
                    catches herself)
                  ...of Thy name...

                            ALL
                  Amen!

       MOM sneezes and a hunk of phlegm flies out and hits
       BABY square in face.

       BABY'S MOTHER screams in horror at seeing her BABY's
       face and the entire congregation1 thinking she's
       been attacked by MOM, dives to the floor in terror.

       COPS draw guns and leap over pews as complete
       pandemonium breaks out in church.

       Just as DET. MOORE and DET. BRADFORD are about to
       grab MOM, GUS and SLOPPY punch the COPS in the mouth
       and MOM runs off.

       DAD looks for MOM in a panic and realizes she has
       vanished.

       CHIP cringes in fear as hordes of COPS surround his
       family until he is relieved to see that MOM has
       escaped.

       MISTY gives "dramatic" poses of "fear" and "horror"
       as cute REPORTER snaps her picture excitedly.

       BIRDIE escapes her parents, runs to CHIP, embraces
       him and together they take off.

       FATHER STONE stares out from altar in shock as
       worshippers scream and trample each other trying to
       get out of church as police try to restore order.

       SCOTTY, trying to be macho, fights his way towards
       front of church and for a split-second sees CHIP,
       BIRDIE and MOM running out back door of sacristy in
       escape.

                            SCOTTY
                  THERE SHE IS!!

       MOM blows a quick kiss to GUS and SLOPPY who beam in
       happiness at helping her escape.

112.   EXTERIOR CHURCH PARKING LOT.

       CHIP and BIRDIE are "hot-wiring" SCOTTY's car as MOM
       lies hidden out of view on back seat of car.

113.   INTERIOR SCOTTY'S CAR.

                            CHIP
                  We'll show 'em, Mom,  We'll
                  go on "60 Minutes"!

       The car engine starts up.

                            BIRDIE
                  Alright
                       (To MOM)
                  You're bigger than Jason or
                  Freddie now!
                      (In wonderment)
                  Only you're a real person!

                            MOM
                       (Innocently)
                  Do you think I'll need
                  a lawyer?

                            CHIP
                     (Putting on his seat belt)
                  You need an AGENT!

       CHIP peels out.

114.   EXTERIOR CHURCH PARKING LOT.

       REPORTER has chased DAD and MISTY to their car,
       still taking pictures as COPS flood the area looking
       for MOM.

                            DAD
                  NO COMMENT!  PLEASE!  My
                  wife is missing!  I'm worried
                  sick about her!
                       (Gets in car)

                            REPORTER
                  Hey, Misty!  Just a few more
                  shots, Ok?  I'm Hank Hawkins
                  from the Baltimore Sun.

                        and posing)
                  Hi, Hank.

                         from inside)
                  MISTY SUTPHIN, GET IN THIS
                  CAR!!

115.   EXTERIOR "SUBURBAN CULT VIDEO" SHOP.

       CHIP and BIRDIE hurry MOM from car and run to door
       of shop as CHIP fumbles for his keys to open up.

116.   INTERIOR "SUBURBAN CULT VIDEO" SHOP.

       CHIP and BIRDIE hustle MOM into the shop and lead
       her to the "Gore" section and open a door covered
       with violent video display boxes to reveal a small
       closet.

                            CHIP
                  In here, Mom...

                            MOM
                  But, Chip...

       CUSTOMER begins banging on door.

                            CHIP
                  Get in, Mom!  I have to open.

                            MOM
                  This is so silly.
                       (Gets in)

       CHIP closes door behind her and then inserts
       cassette into VCR and pushes "Play" button.  On

                     in terror)
                  Haven't you had enough
                  violence, Chip Sutphin?
                  Turn that filth off!

                       (Turning it off)
                  Sorry, ma'am.

                  Do you have the musical,
                  "Annie"?

                            CHIP
                    (Rolling his eyes and
                     getting the cassette)
                  Sure do.  Did you bring

                  You have to rewind the tapes
                  before returning them!

                  dollar fine for not rewinding
                  and this time I'm gonna charge
                  you! $2.99 plus one dollar

                  Keep the change, you son of
                  a psycho!

       MRS. JENSON stomps to door and slams it behind her
       as MOM's face twists in rage as she listens.

117.   EXTERIOR "SUBURBAN CULT VIDEO" SHOP.

       CHIP and BIRDIE exit in a panic and run up the
       street.

       Hidden behind his "borrowed" car across the street
       is SCOTTY who has been watching them all along.  He
       takes off on foot after them.

118.   INTERIOR MRS. JENSON'S KITCHEN.

       A carving knife slices through leg-of-lamb on

       happy face as she fixes herself a leg-of-lamb
       sandwich and exits to living room.

119.   INTERIOR MRS. JENSON'S LIVING ROOM.

       MRS. JENSON kicks off her shoes, excitedly pops
       videocassette into her VCR and climbs into her
       recliner for a relaxing afternoon of video
       pleasures.  She takes a big bite out of her
       sandwich, twangs the remote to start the video and
       smiles excitedly at hearing the overture to
       "Tomorrow" begin over the credit sequence to
       "Annie", her favorite musical.  Subtitle appears
       "12:09pm" and fades out.

122.   INTERIOR MRS'. JENSON'S KITCHEN.

       MOM looks over her shoulder to make sure no one is
       watching and then slowly lets herself in kitchen

       knife on table.

123.   INTERIOR MRS. JENSON'S LIVING ROOM.

       The DOG growls.

                  there.  Shhh...Lick Mommy's

                  You're only a day...
                  AWAAAAAY!!!"

       MOM bludgeons MRS. JENSON with the leg-of-lamb on
       the final note of the song.

       Blood splatters the happy scene on the TV screen.
       MRS. JENSON tries to struggle up from the floor but
       MOM hits her over the head again with leg-of-lamb
       and finishes her off.

       MOM zaps the off button and softly sings to herself
       in the sudden silence.

                            MOM
                  "Tomorrow!..Tomorrow!..Tomorrow!

       jump in.

       Suddenly SCOTTY roars by in his car with MOM in hot
       pursuit.  She sees DAD and family and blows them a
       lunatic kiss.

       lyrics as the DRUMMER, a brain dead drug idiot, hits
       herself on head with drumstick in between beats as
       criminal looking biker-chick GUITARIST plays her
       instrument and mock-humps it with sexual abandon.

       kids.

                            DOORMAN
                       (To SCOTTY)
                  I.D.?

                            SCOTTY
                       (Panicked)
                  Can I give it to you inside?

                            DOORMAN
                  Hey, buddy.  NOBODY gets
                  inside without I.D.

       SCOTTY fumbles for his wallet.

       MOM is hurrying across parking lot staring at SCOTTY
       with a vengeance.

       DAD and the kids speed into parking lot and jump out
       of car.

                            DOORMAN
                       (Looking at Scotty's I.D.)
                  Birthdate?

                            SCOTTY
                    (Straining to remember
                     information on his fake I.D.)
                  Uh...December 14th, 1975.
                       (Pleading)
                  Please!

                            DOORHAN
                  Ok, go ahead,

       SCOTTY snatches back I.D. and rushes inside.

       As horde of cop cars with lights blinking and sirens
       blaring screech into parking lot, MOM pushes her way
       up in line and greets startled kids who recognize
       her.

                            MOM
                  Hi! I know your mom...

                            KID A
                  It's her!

                            KID B
                  Who?

                            MOM
                  Excuse me.
                   (Pushing her way up in line)
                  Age before beauty...

                            KID C
                  The murder lady!  The one
                  on TV!

                            KID B
                  Cool!  Is she in a band?

                            MOM
                       (Butting ahead)
                  Sorry...the police are after
                  me...

                            DOORMAN
                       (Recognizing her)
                  Hey, you're Serial Mom!

                            MOM
                       (Modestly)
                  I guess I am.

                            DOORMAN
                   (Looks up and sees her family
                    and COPS rushing towards her)
                  Come on in lady.  Quick!
                       (Hands her a badge)
                  Here, take this.  A backstage
                  VIP pass.
                       (Proudly)
                  Welcome to Hammerjacks,
                  "Serial Mom"!

                            MOM
                  Thank you so much, you kind,
                  kind creature.

155.   INTERIOR HAMMERJACKS.

       A parents' nightmare.  Grunge-punk hell.  "CAMEL
       LIPS" is undulating suggestively on stage screeching
       out the chorus of "Gas Chamber" as they mock gasp
       for breath, dodge beer bottles thrown from audience
       and punch out male groupies who rush the stage past
       brutish bouncers.

       SCOTTY pushes his way through slam dancing crowd as
       he is picked up and bodily tossed through the air by
       frenzied mob of "body-surfing" dancers.

       MOM is racing to catch up with SCOTTY.

                            MOM
                  Excuse me...coming through...
                     (Snatches beer bottle
                      out of boy's hand)
                  Bill Flowers!  You're underage!

                            BILL
                       (Laughing)
                  Don't kill me, Serial Mom!

                            MOM
                    (Snatching joint out of
                     hophead girl's lips)
                  Just say NO!  And COMB YOUR
                  HAIR, young lady!

                            GIRL
                       (Stoned)
                  Wow!  It's her!
                       (Proudly)
                  AND SHE'S A HEAVY METAL
                  MANIAC!!!

       DAD looks horrified as he politely maneuvers his way
       through crowd as CHIP, MISTY and BIRDIE take over
       and begin "slamming" their way through crowd opening
       up a crowd for DAD.

       The COPS flood the place.  DET. MOORE sees MOM in
       the distance, grabs DET. BRADFORD and they begin to
       fight their way through crowd after her.

       "CAMEL LIPS" incites the crowd from the stage to
       fight back against the police.

       SCOTTY is running toward stage in terror, looking
       over his shoulder and seeing MOM gaining on him.

       DAD gets caught in a mob of slam dancers and is
       lifted off his feet and tossed through the air by
       the crowd.

       MISTY, CHIP and BIRDIE see DAD airborne and start
       slamming into the crowd to save him.  MISTY and CHIP
       slam into big BIKER below DAD and DAD is knocked
       back to the ground safely.

       When BIRDIE sees a slam dancer with a trickle of
       blood running from his nose, she starts gagging at
       the sight of real blood.

       SCOTTY is at the edge of the stage.  He sees MOM
       almost on top of him and leaps onto stage and runs
       for his life, dodging bouncers and beer bottles
       being thrown from audience.

       MOM looks furious that SCOTTY has escaped but then
       looks up at theatrical light rigging overhead and
       then back down at SCOTTY's face as "CAMEL LIPS"
       tries to hit him with their instruments.  MOM looks
       over her shoulder and sees DET. MOORE and DET.
       BRADFORD advancing on her.  Ducking behind a giant
       speaker, out of view of the crowd MOM pulls butcher
       knife from purse, cuts supporting rope and sends
       whole set of lights crashing down on SCOTTY's head.

       The crowd goes wild thinking it's more of "CAMEL
       LIPS" sickening theatrics.

       A gang of heavy-metal chicks slam into DET. MOORE
       and DET. BRADFORD and knock them to the ground.

       MOM's eyes light up in fury when she sees SCOTTY
       still alive, crawling out from under the lights,
       semi-conscious and bleeding.

       BIRDIE faints at the sight of more blood.

       Thinking fast, MOM swipes a hairspray can sticking
       out of a girl's purse and uses her VIP pass to go
       backstage as CAMEL LIPS reaches its deafening
       crescendo of musical mayhem.

       As SCOTTY crawls to side of stage, MOM jumps out
       from a piece of backstage scenery and aims hairspray
       can at him.

                            MOM
                       (Hissing)
                  Buckle up, Scotty!

       MOM lights the spray from the hairspray can and
       ignites SCOTTY's clothes in lethal flames without
       anyone seeing her.

       SCOTTY runs across the stage ablaze as "CAMEL LIPS"
       plays the final deafening note of their song and the
       crowd gives a screaming ovation, all holding up lit
       lighters, thinking SCOTTY on fire is all part of the
       act.

       DET. MOORE and DET. BRADFORD look to the stage in
       horror.

       DAD gasps in fear.  MISTY and CHIP stare speechless
       as SCOTTY falls to his knees and keels over.  BIRDIE
       comes to and then faints again.

       The LEAD SINGER thinks it's a joke, pours a little
       Jack Daniels on the smouldering corpse and then
       jumps back in comic over-reaction when the flames
       light up again.

       MOM, now caught in the front row of laughing
       slam-dancing spectators, turns to her dumb-struck
       family, smiles and sticks fingers in her ears,
       mimicking that the music is much too loud.

       DET. MOORE and DET. BRADFORD slamdance MOM from both
       sides and knock her to the ground and handcuff her.

       DAD puts his arms around CHIP, MISTY and BIRDIE as
       they hang their heads in sorrow.

       "CAMEL LIPS" and the entire audience of grunge-punks
       boo and jeer the police as they drag MOM out as she
       smiles innocently in suburban lunacy.

       Slow fade to black.

156.   Slow fade from black to EXTERIOR TOWSON COURTHOUSE.
       WINTER.

       DAD, CHIP, BIRDIE, MISSY and her new boyfriend, the
       REPORTER get out of folksy lawyer, HERBIE HEBDEN'S
       car and follow him through crowd of hostile press-
       trial groupies, and MOM1s punk-grunge fans, feeling
       the full heat of MOM's serial killer infamy.  DAD
       wears a "Say No to the Gas Chamber" button and
       BIRDIE has turned hippy, wearing tie-dye clothes
       covered in peace signs.  CHIP, on the other hand,
       looks cooler, wears L.A. styled outfit and carries
       copy of Variety.  MISTY is obviously very much in
       love and the REPORTER seems to feel the same way
       about her.  Subtitle appears "Four months later,
       Monday, January 18th, 9:46am" and then fades out.

                            PRESS A
                  Mr. Sutphin!  How does your
                  wife feel?

                            DAD
                       (Grim-faced)
                  Beverly is devastated by the
                  charges against her.

157.   INTERIOR PRISON BUS.

       Female criminals are handcuffed and seated around
       MOM on their way to court as MOM leads them in a
       joyous and Disney-esoue rendition of "100 Bottles of
       Beer on the Wall".  MOM sings out with insane
       happiness and glee.

158.   INTERIOR COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE OF COURTROOM.

       A "COURT TV" reporter is interviewing trial groupies
       as they wait in line to go through metal detectors
       to attend MOM's trial.

                            COURT TV
                  ...And you, ma'am, how long
                  have you been waiting to get
                  in?

                            LADY A
                    (Beaming at the attention)
                  Since 5:00am.  But it's gonna
                  be worth it!  I know she's guilty!

                            HUSBAND A
                    (Leaning into the shot)
                  We've been to famous trials
                  all over the country!

                  ..Manson.. .Watergate...
                       (To Lady A)
                  Didn't I see you at Hinkley?

                            LADY A
                       (Proudly)
                  I was there!  My husband
                  thought I was crazy but...
                    (Seeing Sutphin family
                     getting off elevator)
                  LOOK!  HERE THEY COME!!
                  That awful family!

       The hostile crowd starts craning their necks and
       screaming in recognition as if rock stars are making
       their entrance.  DAD is blinded by the press's
       flashbulbs as HERBIE HEBDEN tries to stop CHIP from
       signing autographs as BIRDIE hands out "Stop the
       Violence" handbills.  REPORTER BOYFRIEND gives MISTY
       the signal and she starts crying for his exclusive
       news shots.

159.   INTERIOR COURTROOM.

       Packed with spectators, press and security officers.
       The middle-class jury of seven woman and five men
       take their place in the jury box as Sutphin family
       take their seats in front row behind HERBIE HEBDEN
       at his defense table.

       TIMOTHY NAZLEROD, the prosecutor, studies evidence
       photos of victim's bodies at the District Attorney's
       table on other side of the courtroom.  He looks up
       in disgust as MOM makes her apple-pie entrance.
       Escorted by two stern-faced police matrons.
       Subtitle appears "10:00am" and fades out.

                            MOM
                     (Happily waving to DAD)
                  Hi, honey!

       DAD smiles back pitifully.

                            MOM
                     (To CHIP, BIRDIE & MISTY)
                  Kids, did you do your homework?

       They give her a weak smile and nod "Yes".

                            JUDGE
                  Quiet in the courtroom! Court
                  is now in session!

                            MOM
                       (To JURY)
                  Hello, jury people.
                  My name's Beverly Sutphin.
                   (To startled woman juror)
                  I like your jacket!

                            JUDGE
                       (Losing patience)
                  Mrs. Sutphin, I SAID QUIET!
                  You are accused of mass murder!
                  This is a court of law, not
                  a coffee klatch!
                       (Bangs gavel)
                  Mr. Nazlerod, your opening
                  statement.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Thank you, your honor.
                       (Approaches JURY)
                  Ladies and Gentlemen of the
                  Jury, my name is Timothy
                  Nazlerod...
                       (Smarmily)
                  ...and I hope we can be
                  friends!
                    (JURY stares back
                     impartially)
                  ...I warn you, this is not a
                  pretty case...Beverly Sutphin
                  is a woman evil to the core...
                   (JURY POV shot of innocent-
                    looking MOM staring back
                    at them)
                  ...a rotten apple, if you will...
                    (DAD gulps in sorrow)
                  ...who beyond a reasonable
                  doubt killed five innocent
                  people!!

       SPECTATORS scowl hatefully at MOM.

                            CHIP
                     (Whispering to BIRDIE,
                      making excuses)
                  Well...they sort of deserved it...

       BIRDIE pales over the mere thought of violence.

                            DAD
                       (To CHIP)
                  Shhhhh!

       He looks over and sees MISTY and REPORTER BOYFRIEND
       are holding hands and glares at them to stop.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  ...THAT'S RIGHT!  SHE MURDERED
                  THEM!...WITH A SPEEDING CAR...
                  A FIRE POKER...

       MOM subtly motions to MALE JUROR that he has
       something in his nose.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  ...A PAIR OF SCISSORS...

       JUROR self-consciously feels around his nostrils in
       embarrassment.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  ...A TOPPLED AIR CONDITIONER!

       MOM signals to JUROR that the problem is still
       there.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  ...THE LETHAL FLAMES FROM AN
                  AEROSOL CAN...EVEN A LEG OF
                  LAMB!!

       JUROR blows his nose.  MOM smiles happily to him
       that the problem is solved.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  ...Beverly Sutphin is not a
                  woman!...

       MISTY and REPORTER are watching and move even closer
       together to snuggle.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  ...SHE IS A MONSTER!!

       MOM's smile turns to horror as JUROR #8 on end of
       second row crosses her legs and MOM zeros in on her
       hideous white summer shoes.

       Wipe to a disheveled HERBIE HEBDEN, the ultimate
       liberal defense attorney, as he paces back and forth
       before JURY wiping his brow.

                            HERBIE HEBDEN
                  ...Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm
                  Herbie Hebden and you and I
                  have a tough job ahead of us...

       MOM is still staring insanely at JUROR1s shoes.

                  ...I have known the Sutphin
                  family for sixteen years...

       MOM is frantically scribbling a note to her attorney
       on a legal pad.

                            HERBIE HEBDEN
                  ...Dad, Eugene, is my dentist...

       DAD self-consciously smiles to JURORS.

                            HERBIE HEBDEN
                  ...Chip and Misty played with
                  my own children...

       CHIP smiles to MOM's few heavymetal supporters as
       REPORTER BOYFRIEND puts his arm around MISTY.

                            HERBIE HEBDEN
                  ...but I've found out I don't
                  know Beverly Sutphin at all!

       He is trying to ignore MOM as she passes him a note
       that says "Juror #8 is wearing white summer shoes!"

                            HERBIE HEBDEN
                  ...No one really knows Beverly
                  Sutphin...

       MOM writes angrily "AFTER LABOR DAY!!"

                            HERBIE HEBDEN
                  ...You see...
                    (He reads note to humor MOM)
                  ...Beverly Sutphin is INSANE!!

                            MOM
                       (Suddenly defiant)
                  I AM NOT!

       Courtroom spectators gasp as DAD's mouth falls open.

                            HERBIE HEBDEN
                     (Trying to make his point)
                  Yes, she committed these
                  terrible crimes...
                       (Pleading)
                  ...but that doesn't make her
                  a bad person.

                            MOM
                       (Standing)
                  Your honor, I have a motion.
                  I would like to fire my
                  attorney, and defend myself!

       Sutphin family looks at one another, shocked at
       MOM's change of plans.

                            HERBIE HEBDEN
                  Beverly Sutphin is not guilty,
                  by reason of INSANITY!

                            MOM
                  Oh shut up, Herbie!
                       (To JUDGE)
                  I have the right to defend myself,
                  your honor.  I've read the
                  lawbooks!  "Ware vs. State, 1964",
                  and "Schutte vs. State, 1962".

                            JUDGE
                  Mrs. Sutphin, a defendant
                  who has herself for a lawyer
                  has a fool for a client...
                       (To attorneys)
                  Approach the bench!

       MOM smiles at DAD who looks bewildered as CHIP,
       MISTY and REPORTER BOYFRIEND give MOM the thumbs-up
       sign as BIRDIE nervously flashes her the peace sign.

                            JUDGE
                     (As bench conference
                      breaks up)
                  Mrs. Sutphin, I have no
                  legal choice but to allow
                  you to take over as your own
                  attorney.

       DAD looks worried and unsure.

                            HERBIE HEBDEN
                   (Sulking out of courtroom,
                    to MOM)
                  You'll get my bill, I mean
                  it!  A big one!

                            JUDGE
                       (To MOM)
                  How do you plead?

                            MOM
                       (Proudly)
                  NOT GUILTY, your honor!

       Courtroom and press buzz intently at MOM's new plea.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                       (Furious)
                  I call to the stand, Dottie
                  Hinkle!

       A vindictive and hostile, DOTTIE HINKLE enters the
       courtroom and eagerly takes the stand.  As she is
       sworn in, MOM watches her with an evil smile.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Mrs. Hinkle, did you ever
                  receive obscene telephone
                  calls?

                            DOTTIE
                       (Staring right at MOM)
                  I certainly did.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Did you recognize the voice
                  of the caller?

                            DOTTIE
                  Not at first, but then I
                  heard the same inflection in
                  a voice at a social gathering
                  and I put two and two together.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Who's voice was it, Dottie?

                            DOTTIE
                       (Pointing to MOM)
                  It was her!  Beverly Sutphin!
                  Sittin' right there!
                    (Dramatically to JURY)
                  I'm lucky I'm not DEAD!!

       Wipe to MOM approaching DOTTIE HINKLE for
       cross-examination.

                            MOM
                  Mrs. Hinkle...do you drink?

                            DOTTIE
                       (Haughtily)
                  No, I don't.

                            MOM
                  So you weren't drunk when
                  you received those alleged
                  obscene phonecalls?

                            DOTTIE
                  I certainly was not!

                            MOM
                  You mean to tell me the
                  day I came over to Mrs.
                  Ackerman's...the day you
                  claim you recognized my
                  voice...you weren't drinking?

                            DOTTIE
                       (Flustered)
                  One beer with lunch is
                  hardly "drinking".

       MISTY, CHIP and BIRDIE smile at MOM's legal skills.

                            MOM
                  So you do drink?

                            DOTTIE
                  Socially...I'll have a
                  beer.

                            MOM
                  So you admit you just
                  lied?

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Objection!  Argumentative!

                            DOTTIE
                       (Rising to the bait)
                  NO I DON'T, YOU BITCH!

                            JUDGE
                  Sustained.
                       (To DOTTIE)
                  Watch your mouth, Mrs.
                  Hinkle.

       Press scribbles frantically, beginning to doubt
       witness's credibility.

       MOM quickly and sneakily mouths "FUCK YOU" to DOTTIE
       without the JUDGE or anyone else in the courtroom
       besides DOTTIE seeing.

                            DOTTIE
                       (Shocked, to JUDGE)
                  Did you see her?!  She just
                  said "Fuck you" to me!

                             MOM
                        (Innocently, to JUDGE)
                  Let the record show I'm
                  just standing here.

                             DOTTIE
                  FUCK YOU TOO, YOU WHORE!

                             JUDGE
                  I'm warning you, Mrs. Hinkle.
                  One more obscenity and I'll
                  charge you with contempt of
                  court.

       DAD watches, amazed at his wife's cunning.

                            MOM
                       (Dramatically)
                  Mrs. Hinkle, are you insane?

                            DOTTIE
                  NO I'M NOT, YOU MOTHER-FUCKER!

       Police matrons lunge at DOTTIE as she leaps from
       witness box to attack MOM.

                            JUDGE
                       (Bangs gavel)
                  Mrs. Hinkle, I find you
                  guilty of contempt of
                  court and sentence you to
                  a thousand dollar fine and
                  five days in jail!
                       (To MATRONS)
                  Lock 'er up!

                            DOTTIE
                    (To MOM, being dragged
                     out)
                  YOU COCK-SUCKER!  YOU LOUSY
                  PIG-FUCKER!

       MOM smiles at JURY and turns to wink at her amazed
       family as spectators watch, willing to give MOM, for
       the first time, the benefit of the doubt.

       Fade out.

160.   Fade in to COURTROOM HALLWAY.  MORNING.

       CHIP is pacing up and down yelling into a mobile
       phone outside MOM's trial as long line of spectators
       wait to get in.  Subtitle appears "Tuesday, January
       19th, 10:05am" and then fades out.

                            CHIP
                       (On phone)
                  ...Well, you tell "Geraldo" to
                  go to hell!  I don't care what
                  Jeffrey MacDonald's people got
                  - he's old news!  We fly first
                  class or we don't do the show!

       A YOUNG MAN angrily approaches CHIP.
         
                            YOUNG MAN
                  Are you Chip Sutphin?

                            CHIP
                       (Into phone)
                  Hold on...
                       (To YOUNG MAN)
                  Yeah I am, but you'll have
                  to speak to my agent...

                            YOUNG MAN
                  Your mom killed my brother!

       He punches CHIP in the mouth.

                            CHIP
                       (Getting up, rubbing
                        his jaw)
                  That's cool...hey look, you're
                  Carl's brother, right?

                            YOUNG MAN
                  That's right.

                            CHIP
                  I'm sorry he's dead, but...
                  have you signed off yet?

                            YOUNG MAN
                    (Suddenly all business)
                  You mean for TV or print?

                            CHIP
                  TV, man!  Farrah Fawcett's
                  interested in playing my
                  mother!

                            YOUNG MAN
                   (Impressed, eyes lighting up)
                  Farrah Fawcett?!  Who's gonna
                  play my brother?  Is Jason
                  Priestly available?

       LU-ANN HODGES, pot-head witness from PTA murder is
       on the stand testifying for the prosecution.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Miss Hodges, could you describe
                  the car...the one you saw run
                  over Mr. Stubbins in cold blood?

                            LU-ANN
                       (Giggling)
                  I seen that movie!...On cable!

       MOM stares in shock at JUROR #8 who has the nerve to
       give MOM a friendly smile back while wearing yet
       another hideous pair of white summer shoes.  Trying
       to suppress her rage, MOM turns to spectator section
       and happily notices the faces of GUS and SLOPPY
       smiling back to her in support.

                            MOM
                       (To NAZLEROD)
                  Thank you.
                       (To DET. BRADFORD)
                  Detective Bradford, if I was
                  to look through your trash can,
                  what reading material would I
                  find?

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Objection!  Immaterial!

                            JUDGE
                  You may answer.

                            DET. BRADFORD
                  .."Time"..."Newsweek".  My
                  wife gets "Ladies Home Journal"...

                            MOM
                       (Smiling)
                  Well, this magazine was found in
                  your trash just last night...
                       (Holds up porno magazine)
                  ...It's called "Chicks with Dicks".

                            DET. BRADFORD
                       (Turning bright red)
                  GODDAMN YOU!  THAT'S TRESPASSING!

       The entire courtroom bursts into laughter except for
       his partner, DET. MOORE, who looks at him in shock.
       GUS and SLOPPY laugh the loudest.

                            MOM
                  Don't judge people by what
                  they read, Detective.
                       (Smugly)
                  Your witness, Mr. Nazierod.

       MOM winks to SLOPPY and GUS.

                            DET BRADFORD
                   (Sputtering, purple with rage)
                  I'm a married man!!

       BAILIFFS forcefully remove him from the stand.

                            DET. BRADFORD
                       (Yelling to MOM)
                  I hope you get the gas chamber!

                            JUDGE
                  The jury is instructed to ignore
                  the outburst of the witness.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                    (Furious at MOM's
                     cross-examination)
                  I call to the stand Rosemary
                  Ackerman!

       Wipe to MRS. ACKERMAN on the stand holding the fire
       poker murder weapon tagged as evidence.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  ...and did you ever see the
                  fire poker again after you
                  left it with Mrs. Sutphin?

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  Yes!  Thirty minutes later
                  it was covered with blood and
                  gore and Carl Padgett was dead!

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  No further questions.

                            MOM
                   (Standing to cross-examine)
                  Mrs. Ackerman, when you left
                  me at the flea-market, where
                  did you go?

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  ...Browsing.

                            MOM
                  Did Carl Padgett buy
                  something you wanted?

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  I didn't want that Faberge
                  egg - it was chipped!

                            MOM
                  Carl Padgett died for the
                  Franklin Mint, didn't he?!

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                    (Shocked at the suspicion
                     being pointed at her)
                  NO!  I could never hurt anyone!

       Spectators buzz.

                            MOM
                       (Not letting up)
                  That was your People magazine
                  with the letters cut out, wasn't it?

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  Yes, but I lent it...

                            MOM
                       (Cutting her off)
                  And those were your scissors
                  found sticking out of Mrs.
                  Sterner's stomach, weren't they?

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                       (Stuttering, panicked)
                  Yes...but...I didn't...

                            MOM
                       (Suddenly, dramatically)
                  Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
         
                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                   (Horrified at the sudden
                    silence in court as everyone
                    stares at her in hostility)
                  No...
                       (Weakly)
                  I don't have room in my kitchen...

       GUS, SLOPPY and all the spectators let out a howl of
       disapproval.  Even the JUDGE scowls at the witness
       in disgust.

164.   EXTERIOR COURTHOUSE.

       REPORTER BOYFRIEND is unpacking stack of the
       "instant" book he wrote "Serial Mom - The Real
       Story" and autographing them for a line of
       housewives.

                            HOUSEWIFE A
                       (To RALPH)
                  Could you sign it: "To
                  a future Serial Mom"?

                            REPORTER
                       (Signing)
                  Sure.  You think she did it?

                            HOUSEWIFE B
                  I have reasonable doubt.

                            HOUSEWIFE C
                       (Buying a book)
                  I feel like killing a couple
                  of people myself!

       All the HOUSEWIVES in line begin booing and jeering
       MRS. ACKERMAN as she runs in terror from courthouse
       with GUS and SLOPPY chasing after her.

165.   INTERIOR COURTHOUSE.

       DET. MOORE is on witness stand being examined by the
       prosecution.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Detective Moore, did you
                  then proceed to the stage
                  area inside "Hammerjacks"?

                            DET. MOORE
                  Yes, I did.  Scotty Barnhiil
                  was on fire and he fell to
                  his knees in flames.

       BIRDIE looks up from reading "Ghandi" biography and
       gags as prosecutor hands DET. MOORE a gory 8x10
       glossy photo of victim.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Would this be what you saw?

                            DET. MOORE
                  Yes, sir.  A real barbecue.

       Suddenly a buzz starts in the courtroom and all
       heads turn to the back of the spectator section
       where the real life star, FARRAH FAWCETT* is
       entering with an entourage to "observe" Serial Mom.

       MOM acknowledges MS. FAWCETT with a dignified nod as
       DAD looks on in amazement.

       DET. MOORE, the JURY, even the JUDGE crane their
       necks to get a better look at FARRAH FAWCETT.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                       (Ignoring FARRAH FAWCETT,
                        trying to continue)
                  Your honor!
                       (Impatiently)
                  May the photo be entered in as
                  evidence and passed to the jury?

                            JUDGE
                  Huh?...oh yeah...YES.

                            DET. MOORE
                       (Star-struck)
                  Jeeeeze!  It really is Farrah
                  Fawcett!

                            JUDGE
                     (Blurting out, unable
                      to contain himself)
                  I loved you in "The Burning
                  Bed"!

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                         (Furious at JUDGE)
                  No further questions!
                         (Smugly looking at MOM)
                  I call to the stand, Marvin
                  Pickles.

       MOM looks back in sudden fear at the prospect of
       this mystery witness.

166.   INTERIOR COURTHOUSE MEN'S ROOM.

       MARVIN PICKLES, the pervert from the flea market
       bathroom has locked himself in a stall and is
       scrawling "I SNIFF JURIES' UNDERPANTS" on wall.

       A POLICE OFFICER enters men's room, frantically
       banging on bathroom doors.

                            COP
                  MR. PICKLES!  MR. MARVIN
                  PICKLES!

                            MARVIN
                  Be right out.

                            COP
                  The Judge is waiting for you!

167.   INTERIOR COURTROOM.

       MARVIN PICKLES hurriedly enters as all heads turn to
       follow him to the stand.  CHIP, who has joined
       BIRDIE and his family looks at MOM and sees her
       worried expression.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  State your name, please.

                            MARVIN
                  Marvin A. Pickles.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Were you in the men's room
                  at the Edmonson Drive In
                  Flea Market on Saturday,
                  September 19th?

                            MARVIN
                  Yes, I was.

       FARRAH FAWCETT answers a ringing mobile phone in her
       purse.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Did you see anybody in the
                  booth next to you?

       MARVIN sinks down lower in witness chair so he can
       get a better view up MOM's skirt.

                            MARVIN
                  I...um...
                       (Turned on)
                  uh...

       MOM looks at him confused, still unaware of his
       letchery.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                       (Getting testy)
                  Mr. Pickle!  Did you see
                  anybody in the booth next
                  to you?

                            MARVIN
                  I...1'm not sure...
                   (Really turned on,
                    starting to moan)
                  ...I...oohhh...Excuse me...

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                       (Outraged)
                  What do you mean, you're not
                  sure?!

       MOM suddenly realizes MARVIN is looking up her
       skirt.  In a brilliant legal maneuver she begins
       inching her skirt up a little higher under the table
       out of view of the rest of the courtroom, giving
       MARVIN a better view and hoping to change his
       damning testimony.

                            MARVIN
                   (Eyes popping out of head)
                  There was nobody next to me:

       Housewife trial groupies start buzzing wildly in
       newfound support of MOM.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                       (Losing it)
                  Mr. Pickles, you testified
                  before the Grand Jury that
                  you looked down and "saw a
                  pair of lady's shoes" in the
                  stall next to you.

       MOM smiles like the perfect saint as she begins
       flapping her leqe back and forth under the table,
       flashing MARVIN her very prim nun-like undergarments
       out of view of the rest of the courtroom.

                            MARVIN
                       (Lost in his own
                        perverted glory)
                  Ohhhh!  I just said what you
                  told me to!

       DAD looks over at MISTY and REPORTER BOYFRIEND who
       have rejoined the family in court and is horrified
       to see them with their arms wrapped around each
       other, cuddling.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  PERJURY IS A SERIOUS OFFENCE,
                  MR. PICKLES!!

       MOM is flapping her legs back and forth double time
       as MARVIN goes into his own private orgasm.

                            MARVZN
                  Ooohhhhhh!  I made it all up!
                  I never saw Beverly Sutphin
                  in my life!

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                       (Absolutely furious)
                  You'll pay for this, Marvin
                  A. Pickles!
                       (Returning to seat)
                  I'm turning your file over
                  to the vice-squad!!
                       (Sitting down)
                  The prosecution rests, your
                  honor.

                            MOM
                   (Giving MARVIN her version of
                    a sexy smile as he leaves stand)
                  The prosecution has proven
                  nothing, your honor.
                       (To the JURY)
                  The defense also rests!

       The spectators burst into spontaneous applause as
       DAD looks at the kids in fear at the upcoming
       verdict.

168.   Wipe to HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF COURTROOM.

       FARRAM FAWCETT is giving an impromptu press
       conference to the throng of adoring reporters.

                            FARRAH FAWCETT
                  ...I feel that Beverly Sutphin
                  is an innocent woman, wrongly
                  accused.  A normal housewife
                  trapped in a nightmare of
                  circumstantial evidence...

169.   INTERIOR COURTROOM.

       TIMOTHY NAZLEROD is giving the prosecution's closing

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                       (Pointing to MOM)
                  ...That's her!  Henrietta Lee
                  Lucas!  Joan Wayne Gacy!  A
                  new face in the deck of serial
                  killer trading cards... Find
                  her guilty of all five counts
                  of first degree murder...!

       FARRAH FAWCETT is still pontificating for the press.

                            FARRAH FAWCETT
                  ...I only hope that I can
                  portray "Serial Mom"'s life on
                  the TV screen with the proper
                  dignity that this feminist
                  heroine deserves.

                            MOM
                   (Addressing the jury with
                    calm believability)
                  Look at me!  I'm a normal
                  person just like you are!

       DAD wipes away a tear as CHIP looks at a preliminary
       design for mini-series showing FARRAH FAWCETT done
       up as MOM.

                            MOM
                  ...But I've been framed by
                  the police...

       MISTY and REPORTER BOYFRIEND are now openly making
       out in courtroom.

                            MOM
                  ...and perjured against by
                  the very people I thought
                  were my friends...

       BIRDIE looks out of courtroom window and sees a bird
       eating a worm and shudders in horror as CHIP pats
       her hand affectionately.

                            MOM
                  ...All I ask is that you
                  have the courage to find
                  me innocent of these terribly
                  untrue charges...

172.   HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF COURTROOM.

       FARRAH FAWCETT is "reenacting" MOM's closing
       argument for the enthralled press corp.

                            FARRAH FAWCETT
                       (Hammily)
                  ...All I ask is that you find
                  me innocent of these terribly
                  untrue charges...

173.   INTERIOR COURTROOM.

       Dissolve to stern-faced JURORS filing back into jury
       box, not looking at MOM.  Subtitle appears "Two days
       later.  Thursday, January 21st.  3:20pm" and then
       fades out.

                            JUDGE
                  Ladies and Gentlemen of
                  the Jury, have you reached
                  a verdict?

                            FOREMAN
                  Yes we have, your honor...

       JUROR #8 gives MOM a smile.

                            FOREMAN
                  ...We find the defendant
                  not guilty of all charges.

       Courtroom erupts in pandemonium, FARRAH FAWCETT
       cheering the loudest.  MOM turns to family who sit
       stunned in seats.

                            MOM
                  I'm coming home!!

       DAD forces a weak smile as he turns white as a
       ghost.

                            JUDGE
                       (Bangs gavel in disgust)
                  Court adjourned!

                            DAD
                    (Whispering to a shocked
                     CHIP and MISTY)
                  ...What should I do?

                            CHIP
                       (Suddenly nervous)
                  Bring her home...I guess.

                            BIRDIE
                       (Mumbling to herself)
                  No more violence...No more
                  violence...

                            REPORTER BOYFRIEND
                  Think she'll like me?

                            MISTY
                       (Worried)
                  Just be nice to her.  And try
                  ...just try not to get on her
                  nerves.

       MOM rushes over to DAD, free at last and gives him a
       big hug as press, fans, even the jury cheer her
       victory.

174.   INTERIOR COURTROOM HALLWAY.

       The stunned Sutphin family exits as MOM raises fists
       like "Rocky" to cheers of her supporters.

                            MOM
                    (Graciously accepting
                     flowers, signing autographs,
                     posing for the press)
                  I love you!  Thanks for coming!
                     (Slows a kiss to newsteam)
                  Hi Los Angeles!
                     (Looking into another camera)
                  Hello Cleveland!
                     (And another)
                  And you too, New York!

       Down the hall, inside a bank of old fashioned wooden
       phone booths is JUROR #8, excitedly talking on pay
       phone.

                            JUROR #8
                       (Proudly)
                  We did it!  We set her free!
                  I knew she was innocent
                  right from the beginning!...

       Without warning, MOM slams her way into phone booth,
       hangs up the call and grabs receiver out of JUROR
       #8's hand.

                            MOM
                       (Snarling scarily)
                  You can't wear white shoes
                  after Labor Day!

                            JUROR #8
                       (Stammering in open-mouthed
                        terror)
                  No...please...that's not
                  true anymore.

                            MOM
                  Oh yes it is!
                       (In homicidal fury)
                  Didn't your mother ever
                  tell you?!

       MOM suddenly bludgeons JUROR #8 over the head with
       the telephone receiver.

                            MOM
                  Well, now you know!

       JUROR #8, stunned by the blow, struggles to stay
       conscious.

                            JUROR #8
                       (Staggering in pain)
                  But...fashion has changed...

                            MOM
                       (Enraged)
                  No it hasn't!

       MOM imediately hits JUROR #8 over the head again
       with the telephone receiver.

       As JUROR #8's screams are drowned out by the passing
       PRESS MOB, MOM hits her again and again with the
       telephone receiver until JUROR #8 collapses to the
       ground, her white summer shoes turned red with her
       own blood.

       Cut back to Sutphin family, holding on to each other
       for dear life as the mob of supporters swell around
       them.

                            DAD
                     (Realizing MOM is missing
                      in the confusion)
                  Beverly?  Beverly?

       MOM flies out of phone booth wearing a big smile,
       not missing a beat.

                            MOM
                  Right here, honey.

                            PRESS
                  Mrs. Sutphin, can we get
                  a shot with you and Farrah
                  Fawcett?

                            MOM
                  Certainly.

       FARRAH FAWCETT barges in and takes over.

                            FARRAH
                  Hello, Beverly.  I'm Farrah
                  Fawcett
                      (Pulling MOM rudely)
                  You stand here...
                      (To PRESS)
                  Ok, boys, a medium two shot...

                            MOM
                   (Trying to get on other
                    side of FAWCETT)
                  ...but please...if I could
                  just...

                            FARRAH
                    (Rudely shoving MOM back
                     in place)
                  Stay there, Beverly.
                       (Posing)
                  Smile, Serial Mom!

       Flashbulbs explode.

                            MOM
                   (Hissing to FARRAH in the
                    scariest, most threatening
                    voice yet)
                  THAT'S MY BAD SIDE, FARRAH
                  FAWCETT!!

       A JUROR down the hall screams in horror as she opens
       phone booth door and a bloody white shoe pops out.

       FARRAH FAWCETT looks back at MOM in sudden fear.

       MOM glares back with the face of a madwoman.

       Freeze frame.

       Dissolve to epilogue title card:  "Beverly Sutphin
       is a free woman."

                                                             FINAL DRAFT



          INT. DAY
          
          A blurred image forms on a white screen. A horizontal strip of 
          face, eyes motionless and unblinking. 
          
          DAVID
          (VOICE-OVER) 
          Take trust, for instance, or friendship: these are the important 
          things in life, the things that matter, that help you on your 
          way. If you can't trust your friends, well, what then?
          
          EXT. DAWN 
          
          A series of fast-cut static scenes of empty streets. 
          
          DAVID
          (VOICE-OVER)
          This could have been any city: they're all the same.
          
          A rapid, swerving track along deserted streets and down narrow 
          lanes and passageways. Accompanied by soundtrack and credits.
          
          The track ends outside a solid, fashionable Edinburgh tenement.
          
          INT. STAIRWELL. DAY
          
          At the door of a flat on the third floor of the tenement. The 
          door is dark, heavy wood and on it is a plastic card embossed 
          with the names of three tenants. They are Alex Law, David 
          Stevens, and Juliet Miller.
          
          A man climbs the stairs and reaches the door. He is Cameron 
          Clarke, thin and in his late twenties with a blue anorak and 
          lank, greasy hair. He is carrying an awkwardly bulky plastic bag. 
          Cameron gives the doorbell an ineffectual ring and then stands 
          back, shifting nervously from foot to foot until the door is 
          answered.
          
          CAMERON
          Hello, I've come about the room.
          
          Cameron enters and the door closes.
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY
          
          David, Alex, and Juliet sit in a line on the sofa directly 
          opposite Cameron, who shifts uneasily in his armchair. Alex 
          checks some items on a clipboard before speaking.
          
          ALEX
          What's his name?
          
          DAVID
          I don't know -- Campbell or something?
          
          JULIET
          Cameron.
          
          ALEX
          Cameron?
          
          JULIET
          Yes.
          
          ALEX
          (to Juliet)
          Really?
          
          CAMERON
          That's right.
          
          ALEX
          (to Cameron)
          What?
          
          Cameron is not sure what to say.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          Well, Cameron, are you comfortable?
          
          CAMERON
          Yes, thanks.
          
          ALEX
          Good. Well, you've seen the flat?
          
          CAMERON
          Yes.
          
          ALEX
          And you like it?
          
          CAMERON
          Oh, yes, it's great.
          
          ALEX
          Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, 
          don't you think?
          
          CAMERON
          Yes.
          
          ALEX
          Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, 
          all that crap.
          
          CAMERON
          Well, yes.
          
          ALEX
          So tell me, Cameron, what on earth -- just tell me, because I 
          want to know -- what on earth could make you think that we would 
          want to share a flat like this with someone like you?
          
          INT. STAIRWELL. DAY
          
          As Cameron plods slowly down the stairs, his shoes striking out 
          against the stone steps, Alex's criticisms continue.
          
          ALEX
          (VOICE-OVER)
          
          I mean, my first impression, and they're rarely wrong, is that 
          you have none of the qualities that we would normally seek in a 
          prospective flatmate. I'm talking here about things like 
          presence, charisma, style and charm, and I don't think we're 
          being unreasonable. Take David here, for instance: a chartered 
          accountant he may be, but at least he tries hard. The point is, I 
          don't think you're even trying.
          
          Cameron has reached the bottom of the stairs. He opens the main 
          door.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          And, Cameron -- I mean this -- good luck!
          
          Cameron leaves and the main door closes behind him.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          Do you think he was upset?
          
          INT. STAIRWELL. DAY
          
          Inside the hall of the flat, David approaches the door toopen it. 
          Freeze-frame.
          
          ALEX
          (VOICE-OVER)
          David likes to keep spareshoelaces in sorted pairs in a box 
          marked, not just shoelaces', but spare shoelaces'.
          
          David opens the door to the Woman.
          
          WOMAN
          I've come to see about the room.
          
          INT. STAIRWELL. DAY
          
          Outside the door of the flat a young Goth girl, aged about 
          twenty, rings the doorbell.
          
          INT. HALL. DAY
          
          Inside the hall of the flat Alex approaches the door to open it. 
          Freeze-frame.
          
          JULIET
          (VOICE-OVER)
          Alex is a vegetarian. Do you know why? Because he feels it 
          provides an interesting counterpoint to his otherwise callous 
          personality. It doesn't. He thinks he's the man for me. He isn't, 
          though there was a time when, well, there was a time when...
          
          Alex opens the door to the Goth.
          
          GOTH
          I've come about the room.
          
          INT. STAIRWELL. DAY
          
          At the door of the flat a Man aged about thrity-five rings the 
          bell.
          
          INT. HALL. DAY
          
          Inside the hall of the flat Juliet approaches the door to open 
          it. Freeze-frame.
          
          DAVID
          (VOICE-OVER)
          Like one of those stupid posters -- you know, a gorilla cuddling 
          a hedgehog, caption love hurts --- that's what I think when I 
          think of Juliet.
          
          Juliet opens the door to the Man.
          
          MAN
          I've come about the room.
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY
          
          In the living room each of the candidates is interviewed 
          individually with the same seating arrangements as before (i.e. 
          the trio on the sofa and the applicant on the chair). What we see 
          are briskly intercut excerpts from each of these interviews. We 
          do not get the responses to the questions, although we may see 
          some facial reaction.
          
          All of David's questions are to the Woman.
          
          All of Alex's questions are to the Goth.
          
          All of Juliet's questions are to the Man.
          
          DAVID
          All right, just a few questions.
          
          ALEX
          I'd like to ask you about your hobbies.
          
          JULIET
          Why do you want a room here?
          
          DAVID
          Do you smoke?
          
          ALEX
          When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare 
          hands, do you then summon hellfire?
          
          JULIET
          I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden 
          agenda?
          
          DAVID
          Do a little freebasemaybe, from time to time?
          
          ALEX
          Or maybe just phone out for a pizza?
          
          JULIET
          Look, it's a fairly straightforward question. You're either 
          divorced or you're not.
          
          DAVID
          OK, I'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- I'd 
          like you to name the song, the lead singer and the three hit 
          singles subsequently recorded by him with another band.
          
          ALEX
          When you get up in the morning, how do you decide what shade of 
          black to wear?
          
          JULIET
          Now, let me get this straight. This affair that you're not 
          having, is it not with a man or not with a woman?
          
          DAVID
          Turning very briefly to the subject of corporate finance -- no, 
          this is important. Leveraged buy-outs -- a good thing or a bad 
          thing?
          
          ALEX
          With which of the following figures do you most closely identify: 
          Joan of Arc, Eva Braun or Marilyn Monroe?
          
          JULIET
          It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of 
          emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner 
          of your dreams is, quite simply, just that.
          
          DAVID
          Did you ever kill a man?
          
          ALEX
          And when did anyone last say to you these exact words: You are 
          the sunshine of my life'?
          
          JULIET
          OK, so A has left you, B is ambivalent, you're still seeing C but 
          D is the one you yearn for. What are we to make of this? If I 
          were you, I'd ditch the lot. There's a lot more letters in the 
          alphabet of love.
          
          DAVID
          And what if I told you that I was the antichrist?
          
          INT. SQUASH COURT. EVENING
          
          In a sports centre Juliet sits outside a glass-walled squash 
          court. She is ready to play, but at present is watching Alex and 
          David, who are inside the court.
          
          INT. SQUASH COURT. EVENING
          
          Inside the squash court, Alex is about to serve.
          
          ALEX
          Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for 
          personal domination.
          
          DAVID
          Serve.
          
          ALEX
          I was trying to educate you.
          
          DAVID
          Just serve.
          
          ALEX
          In the same fashion as chess.
          
          DAVID
          What?
          
          ALEX
          Chess. Chess is often used as well.
          
          DAVID
          Will you shut up and play.
          
          ALEX
          You're a bad loser.
          
          DAVID
          I haven't lost yet.
          
          Alex serves.
          
          INT. SQUASH COURT. EVENING
          
          The squash-court door opens and David walks out past Juliet as 
          Alex stands behind, jabbing his finger at him.
          
          ALEX
          Defeat, defeat, defeat-- sporting,personal, financial, 
          professional, sexual, everything. Next.
          
          Juliet walks in and closes the door.
          
          INT. SQUASH COURT. EVENING
          
          Inside the squash court Alex is about to serve.
          
          ALEX
          Did you know --
          
          JULIET
          Just serve.
          
          Alex serves.
          
          INT. JULIET'S CAR (A MINI). NIGHT
          
          Alex sits in the back, drinking.
          
          Juliet is driving. David sits beside her.
          
          ALEX
          I wasn't trying to win.
          
          There is no response from Juliet.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          I don't want to devalue your victory, but I just want you to 
          know: I wasn't trying to win.
          
          DAVID
          Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive 
          competitive urges.
          
          ALEX
          You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
          
          DAVID
          Discussion group, Alex, discussion.
          
          JULIET
          I thought you stopped going.
          
          ALEX
          Yeah, he had one too many of thise urges. You of all people 
          should know that.
          
          Alex leans close to Juliet. Juliet brakes abruptly and, as Alex 
          flies forward, elbows him in the chest.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          God, you two are sensitive. All I'm doing is implying some sort 
          of sordid, ugly, sexual liason. Why, I'd be proud of that sort of 
          thing.
          
          JULIET
          Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.
          
          ALEX
          For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.
          
          JULIET
          For the flat.
          
          ALEX
          No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to 
          that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked 
          her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We 
          had chemistry.
          
          JULIET
          She hated you --
          
          ALEX
          Well, she had problems --
          
          JULIET
          -- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.
          
          ALEX
          -- I'd be the first topoint that out. In all kindness I would. 
          But, like they say, you know, she's got to want to change, hasn't 
          she?
          
          INT. STAIRWELL. DAY
          
          Outside the door of the flat Hugo rings the bell and waits. 
          Juliet opens the door. Hugo is in his early thirties, tall, dark 
          and bohemian in appearance.
          
          JULIET
          You must be Hugo.
          
          HUGO
          You must be Juliet.
          
          JULIET
          Would you like to come in?
          
          HUGO
          I'd be delighted.
          
          Hugo walks in and Juliet closes the door quite deliberately 
          behind him.
          
          INT. VACANT ROOM. DAY
          
          Hugo looks around, pleased at what he sees, while Juliet watches 
          him. He sits on the edge of the bed.
          
          HUGO
          It's nice.
          
          JULIET
          Would you like to see the rest?
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY
          
          Hugo is seated on the sofa, Juliet sits opposite on an armchair.
          
          JULIET
          What do you do?
          
          HUGO
          Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, 
          and now I'm trying to write a novel.
          
          JULIET
          What's it about?
          
          HUGO
          A priest who dies.
          
          JULIET
          I see.
          
          HUGO
          Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.
          
          JULIET
          No.
          
          HUGO
          Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's 
          about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't 
          die. You see, it's better already.
          
          JULIET
          Writing seems easy.
          
          HUGO
          It's a breeze.
          
          The telephone begins to ring out in the hall. Juliet does not 
          move and at first says nothing. Hugo looks at her and towards the 
          door leading to the hall. After several rings, Juliet speaks. 
          
          JULIET
          Do you think you could answer that?
          
          HUGO
          The telephone? 
          It continues to ring.
          
          JULIET
          Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. 
          HUGO
          You're not in.
          
          JULIET
          No.
          
          HUGO
          All right.
          
          Hugo stands up. The ringing continues.
          
          INT. HALL. DAY
          
          Hugo lifts the phone. He turns to face Juliet and looks her in 
          the eye as he lies on her behalf.
          
          HUGO
          Hello. Yes. Who's calling please? Well, I'm sorry, but she's not 
          in right now. I don't know. Would you like to leave a message?
          
          Hugo replaces the receiver.
          
          HUGO
          (CONTINUED)
          It was some guy called Brian.
          
          JULIET
          Did he sound upset?
          
          HUGO
          A little bit. Is that good or bad?
          
          JULIET
          It's an improvement.
          
          The telephone begins to ring again.
          
          HUGO
          Shall I answer it?
          
          JULIET
          No, just leave it. He knows I must be at home. I'm working nights 
          this week.
          
          The telephone continues to ring.
          
          HUGO
          Working nights?
          
          JULIET
          I'm a doctor.
          
          HUGO
          And he's a patient of yours?
          
          JULIET
          No. But he needs treatment.
          
          HUGO
          For what?
          
          JULIET
          A certain weakness.
          
          HUGO
          The human condition.
          
          JULIET
          You know about it?
          
          HUGO
          I write about it?
          
          JULIET
          And that's not the same thing?
          
          HUGO
          No, but like all novelists, I'm in search of the self.
          
          INT. KITCHEN. MORNING
          
          Juliet, dressed and fatigued, sits at the table sipping a coffee. 
          Alex is also seated at the table, but wearing an old dressing-
          gown and munching at cornflakes while he reads a newspaper and 
          talks at the same time. An array of other papers is spread over 
          the table.
          
          ALEX
          Has he tried down the back of the fridge? I mean, that's where I 
          normally find things.
          
          JULIET
          He seemed like a nice guy, Alex.
          
          Juliet gets up and leaves the kitchen. The soundof a bath running 
          is heard.
          
          ALEX
          I'm not saying he didn't seem like a nice guy. All I'm saying is, 
          it's a bit strange, and this search for the self, and what he's 
          on about, you know.
          
          Alex hears the mail falling through the door and stands up to 
          leave the kitchen and get it.
          
          JULIET
          (calling from outside)
          He didn't seem strange, Alex.He seemed, you know --
          
          INT. BATHROOM.MORNING.
          
          Juliet watches the bath fill.
          
          JULIET
          ...interesting.
          
          INT. KITCHEN. MORNING
          
          Alex considers her reply.
          
          ALEX
          Interesting. Interesting.
          
          INT. HALL. MORNING
          
          Alex is walking through the hall to the door,muttering 
          interesting' to himself. As he passes the phone starts to ring. 
          He stops and lifts it.
          
          ALEX
          Hello. No, she's not in. No. No. No. No ideas.
          
          Alex replaces the reciever and walks on to the door.
          
          JULIET
          (from the bathroom)
          Who was it?
          
          ALEX
          I don't know. He sounded Swedish. Do you know any Swedish men? 
          Maybe it was just the emotion.
          
          Alex picks up the mail and looks through it. As he does so,David 
          emerges from his room, dressed for work.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          What do you think?
          
          DAVID
          About what?
          
          ALEX
          About this guy, this Hugo person.
          
          DAVID
          I don't have time.
          
          ALEX
          I'm only asking what you think.
          
          DAVID
          I don't have time to discuss it now. I don't care so long as he's 
          not a freak.
          
          David opens the door. Alex hands him an envelope.
          
          ALEX
          This is for you. It's your mother's handwriting, so I didn't open 
          it. I don't like reading about your father's constipation.
          
          David snatches the letter and leaves, closing the door.
          
          Alex walks back across the hall, opening one of the letters and 
          reading it quickly.
          
          JULIET
          (calling from the bathroom)
          So we'll meet him, then?
          
          ALEX
          What? Oh, yeah, sure, if you want. I tell you, every letter this 
          guy writes to you is the same: they all begin like pure love and 
          descend into open pornography. I dream of your thighs, the soft 
          touch of your white skin leading me in desire, while I, aroused 
          and inflamed --'
          
          Juliet's hand and arm appear around the bathroom door. She 
          attempts to grab the letter. Alex plays at holding the letter 
          just beyond her reach.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          Aroused and inflamed.
          
          JULIET
          Alex.
          
          ALEX
          He even signs them, in his own name, can you believe it? I'd sign 
          someone else's name. I'd sign his name. If I wrote them, that is. 
          Which I don't.
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM. EVENING
          
          Alex, David, Juliet and Hugo sit round a table towards the end of 
          a meal. Alcohol has been consumed. Bowls containing the last of 
          the food sit on the table, being picked at occassionally. Alex 
          dispenses wine mainly into his own glass, alternating with 
          Macallan malt whisky, of which he pours generous amounts.
          
          ALEX
          Interesting.
          
          HUGO
          I see.
          
          ALEX
          Yeah, well, that's what she said. Interesting. That's why you're 
          here, you see.
          
          DAVID
          Normally I don't meet people, unless I know them already.
          
          HUGO
          I see.
          
          DAVID
          People can be so cruel.
          
          ALEX
          So, uh...
          
          HUGO
          What?
          
          ALEX
          What?
          
          HUGO
          You were going to say something.
          
          ALEX
          What was I trying to say? Oh, yes, I think, we think, or at least 
          I suppose we think -- am I right?
          
          JULIET
          Just get on with it, Alex.
          
          DAVID
          Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now.
          
          ALEX
          We think it's fine.
          
          Alex starts eating again. The others watch him expectantly. David 
          coughs.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          It's OK. There's no problem.
          
          HUGO
          You mean I can have the room?
          
          ALEX
          Well, that's what I said, isn't it?
          
          DAVID
          He made it clear.
          
          ALEX
          Why, thank you, David.
          
          JULIET
          Yes, you can have the room.
          
          Alex pours yet more alcohol.
          
          ALEX
          I'm not usually drunk.
          
          JULIET
          Not usually this drunk.
          
          DAVID
          Only on expenses.
          
          ALEX
          It's true. A newspaper is paying for all this. A newspaper...
          
          With exaggerated scorn, Alex knocks over a glass of wine.
          
          JULIET
          In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone --
          
          ALEX
          It was you, Juliet, it was you --
          
          JULIET
          -- instead of what he is --
          
          ALEX
          What I am.
          
          JULIET
          -- which is --
          
          ALEX
          -- which is a hack.
          
          JULIET
          The man we know and love.
          
          ALEX
          A miserable, burnt-out, empty shell of a -- 
          Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          Know and love?
          
          JULIET
          Yeah.
          
          ALEX
          I think you're lying.
          
          JULIET
          You're right.
          
          ALEX
          You see, they don't really know me.
          
          JULIET
          No, Alex, we don't really love you.
          
          Alex smiles at Juliet and drinks again.
          
          ALEX
          Can you afford this place?
          
          HUGO
          Yeah.
          
          Hugo reaches into his pocket and pulls out a thick bundle of 
          notes, which he places in front of Alex. Alex leans over and 
          sniffs the notes.
          
          DAVID
          Can I ask you a question?
          
          HUGO
          Certainly.
          
          DAVID
          Have you ever killed a man? 
          HUGO
          No.
          
          DAVID
          Well, that's fair enough, then.
          
          Alex raises his head.
          
          ALEX
          Certainly smells like the real thing.
          
          EXT. A STREET. NIGHT
          
          At a cash dispenser a man in his thrities is taking out some 
          money.
          
          A younger man, Andy, stands besdie him, looking around in a 
          mildly agitated fashion.
          
          As the money emerges, Andy assaults and robs the man. He starts 
          by smashinf the victim's face repeatedly against the cash 
          dispenser until the Perspex is smeared with blood. When he has 
          final finished and the man lies on the ground, Andy takes the 
          money and the card from the slots, then gets into a car which has 
          pulled up alongside, driven by Tim.
          
          INT. STAIRWELL. DAY
          
          Hugo climbs the stairs, carrying two suitcases. He stops at the 
          door of the flat and looks at a bunch of keys before selecting 
          one, which he inserts in the door.
          
          INT. HALL. DAY
          
          Inside the flat. The door opens and Hugolifts his cases in, 
          kicking the door closed behind him.
          
          INT. JULIET'S ROOM. DAY
          
          Juliet sleeps, undisturbed by the closing of the door.
          
          INT. HALL. DAY
          
          Hugo walks across the halland disappears into his room.
          
          INT. HUGO'S ROOM. DAY
          
          Hugo unpackshis bags. Included in his things are a few syringes 
          and needles. All these he puts into the drawer beside his bed. He 
          checks inside a second bag.
          
          INT. HALL. DAY
          
          Hugo dails a number on the telephone and awaits a reply.
          
          INT. JULIET'S ROOM. EVENING
          
          Juliet is woken by her alarm clock. The time is five p.m.
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
          
          Alex sits watching television, constantly changing channels. 
          Juliet walks in, wearing a dressing gown. She watches Alex for a 
          few moments.
          
          JULIET
          Have you seen Hugo?
          
          ALEX
          No. Any idea which channel he's on?
          
          INT. HALL. MORNING
          
          The telephone is ringing. Alex lifts up the reciever. Again he is 
          wearing his dressing gown and is on his way to pick up the mail.
          
          ALEX
          No, she's not in. 
          Without waiting for any more, he replaces the reciever and walks 
          to the door, where he picks up the mail. On his way back from the 
          door, David emerges, ready to go to work.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          Have you seen him?
          
          DAVID
          Alex, I don't have the time --
          
          ALEX
          Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
          
          DAVID
          No.
          
          David leaves, slamming the door.
          
          INT. KITCHEN. MORNING
          
          Alex returns to the kitchen, pausing only to knock at Hugo's 
          door, which elicits no response. In the kitchen Juliet sits 
          dressed for work, having just returned. He casually opens an 
          envelope and glances at both sides of the letter before handing 
          it to her.
          
          ALEX
          David hasn't seen him either.
          
          JULIET
          So I gathered.
          
          ALEX
          Maybe he didn't like us.
          
          JULIET
          David?
          
          ALEX
          Hugo.
          
          JULIET
          His car's still there.
          
          ALEX
          He's got a car?
          
          JULIET
          So what's wrong with that?
          
          ALEX
          What sort of car?
          
          JULIET
          Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
          
          ALEX
          I will ask you once more, what sort of car -- 
          
          JULIET
          A blue one, OK. And it's still there.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          We see the door to Hugo's room, then Alex rapping sharply against 
          it. David and Juliet stand behind him.
          
          ALEX
          Hugo. Hugo. Sorry about this, but can you open the door? It's us, 
          Hugo, your flatmates and companions. Your new-found friends. He's 
          not in. He's left and we'll probably never see him again.
          
          JULIET
          Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.
          
          ALEX
          So?
          
          JULIET
          Open it.
          
          ALEX
          You want me to kick it open?
          
          JULIET
          Yes.
          
          ALEX
          Now?
          
          JULIET
          Yes.
          
          ALEX
          All right. No problem.
          
          After several ineffective kicks at the door, Alex turns to David.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          You want a go?
          
          INT. HUGO'S ROOM. NIGHT
          
          Inside Hugo's room we see the door as David, outside, throws 
          himself against it. At the third attempt the lock gives way and 
          the door bursts open.
          
          In the foreground at one side is the bed with a naked foot lying 
          still and exposed.
          
          When the door is open, David is first in, followed by the other 
          two. There is a period of silent shock as they contemplate Hugo's 
          naked corpse. Alex opens a window.
          
          DAVID
          Is this what they always look like?
          
          JULIET
          Yes.
          
          Juliet drapes a sheet over the body, covering it completely.
          
          ALEX
          I wonder how he did it?
          
          JULIET
          Did what?
          
          ALEX
          I wonder how he killed himself. I presume that that's what 
          happened. What do you think?
          
          Quite casually, Alex begins to open drawers and cupboards, 
          emptying the contents on to the floor.
          
          JULIET
          Alex.
          
          ALEX
          What? What's wrong?
          
          JULIET
          What are you doing?
          
          ALEX
          I'm just looking.
          
          JULIET
          Don't.
          
          ALEX
          Don't look?
          
          JULIET
          No.
          
          ALEX
          Why not? What's wrong, Juliet? Aren't you curious? Don't you 
          wonder what he died from?
          
          JULIET
          No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?
          
          ALEX
          It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
          
          JULIET
          Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
          
          ALEX
          Old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. Be 
          rational, please, and failing that be quiet.
          
          In a drawer in a bedside cabinet, Alex finds needles, syringes 
          and a small bag of powder. Without comment, he holds it up and 
          throws it on the bed.
          
          He reaches under the bed and pulls out a case, which he opens. It 
          is empty and he pushes it back under.
          
          DAVID
          I've never seen a dead body before.
          
          JULIET
          Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.
          
          Alex continues to search. Juliet walks out.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          Juliet stands alone.
          
          INT. HUGO'S ROOM. NIGHT
          
          Alex continues his brisk search through Hugo's posesseions while 
          David looks on, appalled but speechless.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          Juliet listens to the sounds from the bedroom, then picks up the 
          telephone. She dials 999 and waits for a reply. It rings and 
          rings.
          
          INT. HUGO'S ROOM. NIGHT
          
          Alex has found and opened a large Gladstone bag. Neither David 
          norwe can see into it.
          
          DAVID
          I saw my grandmother, of course, but I don't suppose that counts. 
          I mean, she was alive at the time.
          
          ALEX
          Can I show you something?
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          Juliet awaits an answer.
          
          Alex approaches Juliet with the open bag. She turns around and 
          looks into it, then, seeing the contents, she replaces the 
          receiver. As she does so, the Operator's voice is audible for a 
          second.
          
          OPERATOR
          Hello, emergency services.
          
          The telephone hits the cradle.
          
          INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT
          
          David, Alex and Juliet are seated in silence around the tabel. 
          The bag, stacked with money, lies open on the table.
          
          DAVID
          No.
          
          ALEX
          Think about it.
          
          DAVID
          No.
          
          ALEX
          Come on, David.
          
          DAVID
          No.
          
          ALEX
          Juliet?
          
          JULIET
          No, Alex. It's, it's --
          
          ALEX
          What?
          
          JULIET
          Unfeasible.
          
          ALEX
          Is that all?
          
          DAVID
          You mean immoral.
          
          ALEX
          I'm only asking you both to think about it.
          
          DAVID
          It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick.
          
          ALEX
          But don't tell me that you're not tempted by it. Don't tell me 
          that you're not interested. I know you well enough.
          
          DAVID
          You think so?
          
          ALEX
          (AMUSED)
          All right, then, go ahead, telephone. Telephone the police. Try 
          again. No one's going to stand in your way. Go ahead. Tell them 
          there's a suitcase of money and you don't want it.
          
          INT. HALL. MORNING
          
          The flat is silent. Footsteps are heard outside the door and mail 
          falls through the letter box.
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY
          
          The living room, empty.
          
          INT. KITCHEN. DAY
          
          The kitchen, empty. The bag of money still sits on the table.
          
          INT. HUGO'S BEDROOM. DAY
          
          His corpse lies on the bed, covered as before, incompletely, by a 
          sheet, with parts of his body still showing (a foot, a hand, part 
          of his face or abdomen).
          
          INT. NEWSPAPER OFFICE. DAY
          
          The open-plan office of a busy newspaper. Alex sits at his desk. 
          He is talking on a telephone jammed against his shoulder and 
          while he does so he is casually acknowledging and waving at 
          colleagues.
          
          ALEX
          Now, was there a pet in the house? Yes, a pet, like a dog or a 
          budgie or a gerbil. You see, what I need is PC Plod rescues Harry 
          the Hamster from House of Horror'. All right... well, that's a 
          pity, you see, no pets, no human angle.
          
          Alex hangs up.

          In the accident and emeregency department of a busy hospital, 
          Juliet sifts through a setof casenotes. Another Doctor approaches 
          her.
          
          DOCTOR
          Hi, there.
          
          Juliet does not look up.
          
          JULIET
          Hello.
          
          DOCTOR
          What happened to that guy?
          
          JULIET
          What guy?
          
          DOCTOR
          That guy, the one that died.
          
          Juliet looks up.
          
          JULIET
          What guy that died?
          
          DOCTOR
          That one, last week.
          
          JULIET
          Here?.
          
          DOCTOR
          Yeah, here, I mean, where else?
          
          JULIET
          Oh, him. Well, he died.
          
          DOCTOR
          (SATISFIED)
          That's what I thought.
          
          INT. HUGO'S ROOM. DAY
          
          The body, stillpresent, exposed and motionless. The curtain 
          flutters by the open window.
          
          INT. LUMSDEN'S OFFICE. DAY
          
          Lumsden, a middle-aged chartered accountant, isseated in a 
          largechair behind a desk. He is talking to David,who appears 
          distracted.
          
          LUMSDEN
          What do we do here, David?
          
          DAVID
          Sorry?
          
          LUMSDEN
          Here.
          
          DAVID
          Right here?
          
          LUMSDEN
          In this firm.
          
          DAVID
          Well, it's a wide range of, eh --
          
          LUMSDEN
          Accounting, David, chartered accounting --
          
          DAVID
          Exactly what I was --
          
          LUMSDEN
          -- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?
          
          DAVID
          Not any real sneering as such, no.
          
          LUMSDEN
          There's a whole wide world out there, and it all needs to be 
          accounted for, doesn't it?
          
          DAVID
          Eh --
          
          LUMSDEN
          But they sneer, don't they?
          
          DAVID
          I'm not sure --
          
          LUMSDEN
          Oh, it's unfashionable, I know, but, yes, we're methodical, yes, 
          we're dilligent, yes, we're serious, and where's the crime in 
          that, and why not shout it from the rooftops, yes, maybe 
          sometimes we are a little bit boring, but by God, we get the job 
          done.
          
          DAVID
          Yes, sir.
          
          LUMSDEN
          And that's why I think you fit in here.
          
          DAVID
          I'm boring?
          
          LUMSDEN
          You get the job done.
          
          DAVID
          Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
          
          LUMSDEN
          Which is why I'm trusting you with this account.
          
          Lumsden throws a heavy folder into David's lap.
          
          INT. HUGO'S ROOM. EVENING
          
          It is almost dark.Only the familiar contour is visible through 
          the gloom.
          
          INT. STAIRWELL. EVENING
          
          David ascends the stairs to the flat.
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM. EVENING
          
          Alex sits in an armchair facing out of the window. Juliet stands 
          facing into the room. David, the last home, appears in the 
          doorway.
          
          DAVID
          He's still here.
          
          ALEX
          He couldn't get his car started.
          
          DAVID
          When are you going to let the police know?
          
          ALEX
          You call them if you want.
          
          DAVID
          (to Juliet)
          And what about you?
          
          JULIET
          Well, I'm getting used to having him around.
          
          INT. HUGO'S ROOM. DAY
          
          The corpse as before.
          
          INT. ACCOUNTANT'S OFFICE. DAY
          
          David sits at his desk, looking across the office.
          
          Crouched over a large array of other desks, young men and women 
          in suits are pouring over folders and columned books. No one is 
          speaking except in muted tones on the telephones.
          
          David watches them. He looks to his left and to his right: on 
          either side young men like him are toiling over accounts. He 
          turns and looks behind him, where another array of accountants 
          sit.
          
          He turns back to his desk and opens the file he was previously 
          given. He looks at the columns of records of profit, with a large 
          total at the bottom.
          
          When David looks up he sees Juliet seated beside his desk. She 
          smiles and directs his gaze, with her own, to the surrounding 
          scene.
          
          INT. HUGO'S ROOM. EVENING
          
          The body in silhouette.
          
          DAVID
          (VOICE-OVER)
          OK. Let's do it.
          
          INT. DIY STORE. DAY
          
          Inside a large, brightly lit DIY store with Muzak playing in the 
          background. We start with a tracking shot along an aisle stacked 
          with potentially vicious tools.
          
          ALEX
          (VOICE-OVER)
          All right, now listen. We have to dispose of the body in such a 
          way as to make it unidentifiable, so that even if it is found, 
          then it's never anything more than an unknown corpse. Burning, 
          dumping at sea, and straightforward burial are all flawed either 
          by fingerprints, or, more commonly, by dental records. This I 
          have learned. Now, what I suggest is that we bury him out in the 
          forest, but first of all we remove his hands and his feet, which 
          we incinerate. And his teeth, which we just remove. It's as 
          simple as that.
          
          As the tracking shot ends, we see David's head and shoulders as 
          he looks at something off picture. Suddenly a spring-loaded 
          screwdriver appears and is fired' so that the tip stops a few 
          millimeters from his face. David winces as we see that Alex is 
          holding it.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          I always wondered what these were for.
          
          Alex places the screwdriver down on the shelf and walks across 
          the aisle to pick up a saw and a hammer.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          Now this is what we need. And this. 
          
          Alex hands the tools to David, who looks at them with disgust. 
          Alex walks on.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          Now what else? 
          DAVID
          I don't know.
          
          ALEX
          A spade, we need a spade -- I wish you would concentrate -- we 
          need a spade if we're going to dig a pit.
          
          DAVID
          So who's going to do it?
          
          ALEX
          Dig the pit, I don't know.
          
          DAVID
          No, not that.
          
          ALEX
          Then what? Who's going to do what?
          
          DAVID
          You know what I'm talking about.
          
          ALEX
          Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
          
          DAVID
          You know what. Who's going to do it.
          
          ALEX
          We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me 
          and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?
          
          DAVID
          I can't do it.
          
          ALEX
          I don't hear this.
          
          DAVID
          I won't be able to.
          
          ALEX
          You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you 
          don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat 
          smells. We can't wait any longer.
          
          DAVID
          I'm just telling you I can't cut him up.
          
          Alex turns away in disgust.
          
          EXT. LANE. NIGHT
          
          Late at night, in a quiet lane at the back of the flat, a hired 
          Ford Transit is parked.
          
          INT. VAN. NIGHT
          
          Inside the dimly lit van, Alex and Juliet are laying down plastic 
          on the floor.
          
          JULIET
          Who's going to do it?
          
          ALEX
          I thought we all were.
          
          JULIET
          I don't thinkI can.
          
          ALEX
          But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
          
          JULIET
          I don't want to. It's different.
          
          ALEX
          And now you tell me.
          
          INT. UNDER WATER/BATHROOM. NIGHT
          
          A Man's face is being held under water. Bubbles escape from his 
          mouth and his eys bulge.
          
          Tim hauls the Man's head out of the bath. His legs and arms are 
          bound with cord. Andy sits on a chair, watching.
          
          Tim ducks the Man's head under the water again.
          
          The Man's face as before.
          
          INT. HUGO'S ROOM. NIGHT
          
          We see Hugo's face just before Alex, David and Juliet wrap him in 
          a sheet and thick, black plastic. They wear masks over their 
          noses. The smell is making them uncomfortable and irritable.
          
          DAVID
          There's something I want to ask.
          
          INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT
          
          The Man's head has just been lifted from the water.
          
          MAN
          I don't know. I swear to God, I don't know.
          
          Tim ducks the Man's head back under the water.
          
          INT. HUGO'S ROOM. NIGHT
          
          ALEX
          (angry through his mask)
          Family? Family? Friends? Drugged-up wandering suicidal search of 
          the self fuck-ups don't have families, David.
          
          DAVID
          I just thought we should discuss it.
          
          ALEX
          Take his legs.
          
          INT. STAIRWELL. NIGHT
          
          In the stairwell of the flat, grunts of effort are heard as Alex, 
          David and Juliet struggle with the heavy corpse, carrying it down 
          the stairs wrapped in plastic sheeting. They come into view and 
          go down the stairs. They are all very tense and freeze with panic 
          after accidentally banging against another flat's door. They 
          swear at one another and continue theri descent.
          
          INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT
          
          Tim is ducking the Man again. He writhes and struggles but is 
          powerless to stop it.
          
          EXT. BEHIND THE FLAT. NIGHT
          
          The back yard and back door of the flats. The door opens and 
          Alex, David and Juliet emerge, carrying the corpse out towards 
          the van.
          
          INT. LANDING OUTSIDE THE BATHROOM. NIGHT
          
          From the landing we can see along the floor into the bathroom. 
          The Man's legs extend away from the bath. They are completely 
          still. Andy and Tim stand beside them, looking down.
          
          ANDY
          You stupid bastard.
          
          INT. VAN. NIGHT
          
          Inside the back of the empty van. The door is opened and the body 
          is half slid and half thrown inside. The door is closed and in 
          the dark interior, the outline of the plastic lump is just 
          visible, thanks to a streetlight. One of the doors opens again 
          and David throws a bag of tools in. He then closes and locks the 
          door.
          
          INT. VAN. NIGHT
          
          In front of the van, David is climbing into the passenger side. 
          Juliet and Alex are already in, with the latter at the wheel. 
          Alex turns to the other two.
          
          ALEX
          Why don't we just draw lots for it?
          
          The other two remain silent.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          Whoever draws the short straw does it all. That way, you either 
          do it or you don't. All or nothing.
          
          JULIET
          OK.
          
          ALEX
          David?
          
          DAVID
          I don't know.
          
          ALEX
          Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not 
          going to do it just because you won't.
          
          Alex starts the engine of the van.
          
          EXT. FOREST. NIGHT
          
          Through the darkness we hear an engine, then the headlights of 
          the van come into view.
          
          It pulls off the track onto a patch of grass. The engine is 
          switched off but the light remains on. The trio descend from the 
          van.
          
          In fron of the van, Alex, illuminated by its lights, Alex, David 
          and Juliet stand together. Alex is showing them two long stems of 
          grass and one short one. He encloses them in his fist and holds 
          them out.
          
          ALEX
          All right, then, here we are and this is it. Do you want to play 
          or not?
          
          Alex holds his hand out towards Juliet, who takes the tip of one 
          of the stems. It is one of the larger ones.
          
          Alex and Juliet turn to David. Alex holds out the stems. David 
          reaches out and takes one of the tips. It is the short straw.
          
          DAVID
          I can't do it.
          
          EXT. FOREST. NIGHT
          
          Deeper in the forest, with the headlamps still casting a little 
          light throught the trees, we see David's head and shoulders. His 
          right arm is moving briskly back and forth accompanied by a 
          vicious sawing noise. The sawing stops as he evidently finished 
          with one extremity. He shuffles back and starts sawing at 
          another.
          
          Alex leans against the spade in a shallow pit that he has dug. He 
          observes David impassively. The sawing stops again.
          
          DAVID
          Finished.
          
          ALEX
          But not quite.
          
          DAVID
          Is that going to be deep enough?
          
          Alex bends down to pick up the hammer, which he holds out towards 
          David.
          
          ALEX
          Don't you worry about that.
          
          DAVID
          Is this necessary?
          
          ALEX
          Yes. Now come on, all or nothing.
          
          Most reluctantly, David takes the hammer and looks at Alex, who 
          gestures as if to say, "On you go.' With revulsion on his face, 
          he raises the hammer above his head.
          
          INT. DAVID'S ROOM. DAY
          
          David's face is visible against the plain white backdrop of his 
          pillow.
          
          He lies fully clothed on his bed, looking up at the ceiling. 
          There is a knock at the door, then Juliet walks in.
          
          JULIET
          Are you all right?
          
          DAVID
          (without looking at Juliet)
          Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.
          
          JULIET
          Would you like to talk about it?
          
          DAVID
          No.
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY
          
          Alex sits with his feet up watching a noisy game show, while 
          eating a snack and drinking from a can of beer. Newspapers lie 
          scattered at his feet.
          
          INT. LOFT. DAY
          
          The loft above the flat in darkness, but the trapdoor is opened, 
          letting in a pool of light.
          
          INT. HALL. DAY
          
          David is pulling himself through the trapdoor up into the loft. 
          Beneath him is a stepladder. Juliet stands half-way up the 
          ladder, while Alex stands on the floor beside it. As David enters 
          the loft, Alex hands up the bag of money to Juliet, who passes it 
          on up to David.
          
          JULIET
          Be careful.
          
          ALEX
          Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall 
          through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me?
          
          JULIET
          Stop nagging.
          
          ALEX
          (to himself)
          I don't know why we couldn't stuff it in a mattress or put it 
          under the floor like any normal human being. We could have hid it 
          in the fridge.
          
          INT. LOFT. DAY
          
          David moves on into the dark cavernous loft, edging his way 
          across beams and pipes. There are no skylights.
          
          He stops and leans against some structure (the water tank). He 
          strains to see in the darkness.
          
          Suddenly there is a loud sucking and flowing noise as water 
          empties from the water tank. David is startled and steps forward, 
          tripping. He reaches out as he falls, striking a light switch. 
          Briefly the loft is illuminated: David blinking as he lies across 
          some beams, the large cavernous area, the pipes, the water tank, 
          the bag of money lying between two rafters, and then the old 
          brass switches beginning to spark and the light goes out.
          
          David scrambles towards the trapdoor.
          
          INT. HUGO'S ROOM. DAY
          
          Now clean and empty, with no trace of recent habitation.
          
          INT. HOSPITAL. DAY
          
          In a basement corridor in the hospital, pipes run along the 
          ceiling. Above a fenced-off area is a sign saying For 
          Incineration Only -- No Aerosols'. On the floor of this area are 
          yellow plastic sacks. Juliet appears around a corner carrying one 
          of these. Quite casually the clumps it on the pile and continues 
          past.
          
          EXT. QUARRY. EVENING
          
          Alex pushes a blue car into a quary.
          
          INT. SUBURBAN LOCK-UP GARAGE. NIGHT
          
          In the garage there is a car, gardening equipment, several sacks 
          of fertilizer and a trunk-style deep freeze, on the lid of which 
          sit Andy and Tim. Tim takes out a cigarette and offers one to 
          Andy, who declines.
          
          They slide off the deep freeze and open it.
          
          Inside the freezer there is a man, naked and bound with cord. 
          They lift him up. He is very cold and weak.
          
          The Man begins to whisper inaudibly. Andy moves his head so that 
          he can hear the whisper. He listens, then nods approvingly.
          
          They push him down again and close the lid. Andy holds the lid 
          while Tim dumps the sacks of fertilizer on top.
          
          INT. CHARITY BALL. NIGHT
          
          Alex, David and Juliet are attending a charity ball. Everyone is 
          dressed very smartly, in ball gowns and black ties with the 
          addition of a significant number of kilts.
          
          Neither Alex nor David wears a kilt. The trio seem to know a 
          number of people there but do not seem especially keen to speak 
          to them.
          
          A middle-aged, podgy, mustachioed Master of Ceremonies is 
          standing on a platform in front of the band, making a speech to 
          the diners who are still sat at their tables.
          
          MC
          Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention please. First of 
          all, may I thank you all for coming along tonight and supporting 
          our appeal to raise funds for the sick children's unit.
          
          There is a quick drum roll and applause breaks out. We move to 
          the table where Alex, David and Juliet are seated. Alex leans 
          across to Juliet.
          
          ALEX
          You didn't tell me that this was for children. I hate children. 
          I'd raise money to have the little fuckers put down.
          
          Some other guests around the table cast critical glances at Alex.
          
          JULIET
          Sshh.
          
          ALEX
          I want my money back. Excuse me.
          
          Alex signals to the waiter by lifting his hand and snapping his 
          fingers, then indicates another bottle of champagne that already 
          ists in front of him.
          
          MC
          For all too often there's a complacency: out of sight, out of 
          mind, let someone else bother about these things.
          
          Alex cheers once and starts to applaud on his own. Juliet nudges 
          him viciously.
          
          MC
          (CONTINUED)
          But just before the dancing, I'd like to say a special thank-you 
          to a few of the people who've worked so very hard to make this 
          occassion happen.
          
          The MC's drone continues in the background while conversation 
          continues back at the table.
          
          DAVID
          Do you know many of these people?
          
          JULIET
          Yes. They're my friends.
          
          ALEX
          I see, so if they want to talk to you, we say you're not in.
          
          MC
          And now, ladies and gentlemen, and those of you who are neither 
          or both --
          
          Drum roll.
          
          MC
          (CONTINUED)
          -- would you make your way to the floor for Strip the Willow.
          
          JULIET
          Are we going to dance?
          
          ALEX
          Well, it's physical contact, isn't it?
          
          INT. DANCE FLOOR. NIGHT
          
          The dance floor a few minutes later. It is packed and rather 
          chaotic. Sweaty, dishevelled dancers sling one another around, 
          with the thud of flesh against flesh. Toes are stood on and 
          jackets discarded.
          
          Juliet dances with Alex, who plunges in with the maximum of 
          violence, eventually tripping up and tumbling forcefully among 
          the other dancers.
          
          He starts to get up, then rests his head back against the floor.
          
          David has not been dancing. Instead he remains at their table and 
          at the bar, drinking steadily and watching the other two.
          
          INT. TABLE. NIGHT
          
          Back at the table, while most people are still on the dnace 
          floor, the trio sit drinking and Alex smokes a cigar.
          
          ALEX
          That was good.
          
          DAVID
          Can we talk about something?
          
          ALEX
          Not now. I have an idea.
          
          Alex pours champagne on to a stack of glasses.
          
          DAVID
          Listen, it's important. We need to talk about what we're going to 
          do --
          
          ALEX
          Just stop worrying.
          
          Alex stands and raises his glass.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          Love and happiness for ever.
          
          JULIET
          For ever and ever.
          
          Alex drinks, then puts his glass down. Juliet drinks but does not 
          drain her glass. David sits still.
          
          ALEX
          What's the problem?
          
          DAVID
          I want to talk now.
          
          ALEX
          After you drink to love and happiness forever.
          
          DAVID
          Now.
          
          ALEX
          After.
          
          JULIET
          David, I promise we will. Keep him happy.
          
          ALEX
          It's not for me. It's for love and happiness forever.
          
          David reaches out to take his glass. Suddenly, Alex flings an arm 
          out to point, knocking over David's glass and completely losing 
          interest.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          Look over there. It's Cameron.
          
          JULIET
          Who?
          
          ALEX
          Cameron. You remember Cameron.
          
          JULIET
          No, I don't.
          
          ALEX
          What's he doing here?
          
          JULIET
          That's not him.
          
          ALEX
          Yes, it is. It's him. Cameron, Cameron, come on over.Yo!
          
          From some distance away, Cameron becomes aware of Alex and 
          cautiously makes his way across until he stands a few feet from 
          the table.
          
          CAMERON
          What?
          
          ALEX
          Nothing. We thought you were someone else.
          
          Alex falls forward, laughing, and the other two also laugh as 
          Cameron walks away, humiliated again.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          Good luck. I love that guy, but why does he have to follow us 
          around?
          
          DAVID
          Anyway, what I was wanting to say was this --
          
          BRIAN
          (UNSEEN)
          The divine Juliet. Long time no see.
          
          Brian approaches and is standing behind their table.
          
          JULIET
          Brian.
          
          BRIAN
          Would you care to dance?
          
          DAVID
          Hold on there. Who do you think you are?
          
          BRIAN
          What?
          
          DAVID
          Who do you think you are? You interrupted us.
          
          BRIAN
          I'm Brian McKinley, and who are you?
          
          DAVID
          Well, Brian McKinley, if you want to talk to my girlfriend, you 
          talk to me first. If you want to dance with her, then you apply 
          in writing three weeks in advance or you're gonna end up insode a 
          fucking bin-bag. You didn't apply, so you don't dance.
          
          Shocked and frightened, Brian backs away, then turns around to 
          complete his departure. Juliet restrains David with a touch as 
          they watch him go.
          
          JULIET
          Do you think you could be a little more forceful next time?
          
          DAVID
          I'm sorry.
          
          JULIET
          It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.
          
          DAVID
          That was stressful. I found that stressful.
          
          ALEX
          Yeah, but you were good, you were really good. Fucking bin-bag', 
          I liked that. You were good. You explored your maleness to the 
          full there.
          
          DAVID
          You think so?
          
          JULIET
          Well, you certainly had a good look around.
          
          ALEX
          You were magnificent.
          
          INT. TOILETS. NIGHT
          
          The gents' toilet. Brightly-lit and white-tiled. Alex walk in and 
          goes into a cubicle and closes the door. We hear him whistling 
          and laughing as he passes urine. He keeps muttering bin-bag' to 
          himself. Then he flushes the toilet and opens the door. As he 
          does so a look of surprise appears on his face as he sees someone 
          waiting for him.
          
          ALEX
          Cameron! What a surprise.
          
          As Alex is speaking Cameron's fist flies forward, hitting him in 
          the face and sending him flying backwards. Cameron enters the 
          cubicle and closes the door behind him.
          
          INT. HALL. MORNING
          
          Mail falls through the letter box.
          
          INT. KITCHEN. MORNING.
          
          Alex does not stir.
          
          INT. HALL. MORNING
          
          David emerges from his room, ready for his work. He looks towards 
          the kitchen, then walks to the door and opens it.
          
          INT. KITCHEN. MORNING
          
          We hear the main door closing as David leaves. Alex jolts with 
          energy with every sound. The telephone begins to ring. Juliet 
          looks at Alex expectantly, but he does not move. Eventually she 
          gets up and answers it.
          
          JULIET
          Hello. Hello.
          
          ALEX
          Who was it?
          
          JULIET
          Don't know. No one said anything.
          ALEX
          Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the 
          days when I had such a thing.
          
          JULIET
          Are you all right?
          
          ALEX
          No.
          
          JULIET
          Then let's spend some money.
          
          INT. FLAT. DAY
          
          There follows a video depicting the results of Alex's and 
          Juliet's spending spree. It opens with Alex seated at the kitchen 
          table talking to the camera, absolutely deadpan.
          
          ALEX
          Hello. It's been a struggle, but now the days of worry are over, 
          the light at the end of the tunnel has expanded into a golden 
          sunrise and at last, at long last, nothing will ever be the same 
          again.
          
          Alex leans out and the camera foloows him as he presses the play 
          button on a tape recorder. The music begins.
          
          Fast cuts follow, occasionally interrupted by out-of-focus shots 
          of the floor or ceiling as the camera swivels round and is 
          switched on and off.
          
          Alex wearing several different suits, outfits and silk pyjamas.
          
          Juliet wearing several different outfits.
          
          Both of them posing with small objets d'art.
          
          The expensive watch on Alex's wrist.
          
          Juliet's jewellery.
          
          Expensive toys.
          
          Juliet takes a picture of Alex with a Polaroid camera.
          
          Alex holds the camcorder out at arm's length in order to film 
          himself and turns to the camera and adjusts his tie.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          This is Alex Law reporting from the scene of his own life, and 
          you know, I'm so happy I could die.
          
          Darkness. TV. Turned off.
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY
          
          The music has stopped.
          
          David presses the eject button and lifts the video from the 
          player.
          
          Alex and Juliet are seated on the sofa, surrounded by their 
          acquisitions, and are evidently a little embarrassed. Juliet is 
          holding the Polaroid of Alex.
          
          DAVID
          I think we ought to scrub this, don't you?
          
          David reinserts the tape and presses record.
          
          ALEX
          Will you calm down.
          
          JULIET
          Yeah, you're making us all nervous.
          
          David picks up the Polaroid of Alex and throws it down, then 
          picks up a vase.
          
          DAVID
          How much did you pay?
          
          ALEX
          I don't know.
          
          DAVID
          How much did you pay?
          
          ALEX
          I don't know.
          
          DAVID
          How much?
          
          ALEX
          I don't know.
          
          JULIET
          Two hundred.
          
          DAVID
          Two hundred pounds?
          
          JULIET
          Two hundred pounds.
          
          DAVID
          You paid two hundred pounds for this?
          
          JULIET
          That's what it cost, David.
          
          DAVID
          No, no, no. That's what you paid for it. Two hundred pounds is 
          what you paid for it. We don't know what it cost us yet, for you 
          two to have a good time, we don't know the cost of that yet.
          
          From out in the hall, the phone starts to ring. Nobody moves.
          
          INT. DAVID'S ROOM. NIGHT
          
          David lies awake in his bed.
          
          INT. A FLAT HALLWAY. NIGHT
          
          Hearing the noise, David sits up in bed, then gets out, reaching 
          for his clothes.
          
          INT. STAIRWELL. NIGHT
          
          David looks down the stairwell. Other neighbours, in nightclothes 
          or hurriedly dressed, are standing at the open door of the flat 
          below. David descends the the stairs and looks into the hall of 
          the other flat where the occupant, an Elderly Woman, lies 
          groaning on the floor.
          
          A hand on David's shoulder pushes him out of the way and two 
          uniformed policemen walk past, followed by an ambulance man 
          carrying a stretcher.
          
          DAVID
          Did they take anything? Did they take anything?
          
          No one acknowledges his question or answers it.
          
          The ambulance men emerge carrying the woman, her face bruised and 
          cut. Everyone else begins to melt away.
          
          INT. STAIRWELL. NIGHT
          
          David stands alone on the darkened stairwell.
          
          INT. DAVID'S ROOM. NIGHT
          
          David lies awake in his bed.
          
          INT. DOOR OF THE FLAT. DAY
          
          Someone attempts to open the door but cannot because there are 
          two new security chains on the inside. The door is forced against 
          the chains with no success and Alex calls from the other side.
          
          ALEX
          What is this? What is going on? David!
          
          David approaches the door.
          
          DAVID
          I'll let you in.
          
          David closes the door and looks through a new spyhole to see Alex 
          grinning at him while he releases the chains and then opens the 
          door again. Alex walks in.
          
          ALEX
          What is this?
          
          DAVID
          Security.
          
          DAVID
          From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
          
          DAVID
          There was a break-in.
          
          ALEX
          Downstairs, I know. Pensioner's terror ordeal: page six.
          
          Alex hands David a rolled-up newspaper.
          
          DAVID
          Doesn't it worry you?
          
          ALEX
          No, it doesn't. I tried to let it worry me but it won't. I've 
          worked on that paper for three years. There is a pensioner's 
          terror ordeal on page six every day. Every day. Maybe when I'm a 
          pensioner it'll worry me.
          
          Alex notices some more tools and the stepladder leading up to the 
          trapdoor.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          What's all this for, more security?
          
          DAVID
          I fitted a lock up there. On the inside.
          
          ALEX
          Oh, that'll come in useful.
          
          INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT
          
          Alex is serving on plates from a large bowl of pasta.
          
          David and Juliet sit at the tabel.
          
          JULIET
          Is this the same stuff you made last week?
          
          ALEX
          No, no, it's different.
          
          JULIET
          I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
          
          ALEX
          It tastes different.
          
          JULIET
          I don't want it to taste different. I don't know why I bother. Is 
          that enough for you? Hey!
          
          DAVID
          What? Yes, that's fine.
          
          ALEX
          You're sure? There's lots more.
          
          DAVID
          No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.
          
          ALEX
          What's wrong?
          
          DAVID
          Nothing.
          
          ALEX
          You're not eating.
          
          DAVID
          Not eating what?
          
          ALEX
          Not eating like you used to, that's what.
          
          DAVID
          If you give me the plate, I'll eat.
          
          Alex hands him the plate and he starts to eat. Alex watches him 
          chew a mouthful.
          
          ALEX
          Now swallow.
          
          David does so.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          You know, you should spend some of that money instead of worrying 
          about it. That's my advice.
          
          JULIET
          He's right. You'd feel much better about it.
          
          David has stopped eating.
          
          ALEX
          Once it's spent you won't have to worry about it.
          
          JULIET
          Be like a weight off your shoulders.
          
          ALEX
          You know we're right.
          
          JULIET
          Don't you?
          
          DAVID
          I want to secure it.
          
          ALEX
          Secure it? What do you mean -- you're gong to take it to a bank? 
          You're not going to take it to a bank? You're not going to take 
          it to a bank Or what, you want to bury it? Is that it?
          
          JULIET
          I don't see the point in that.
          
          ALEX
          Because that's no good. Remember, we did what we did, we took the 
          money. It was a material calculation. But what's the use if it's 
          underground, or in some funny bank in some funny place? If you 
          can't spend it, if you can't have it, what use is it? None. It's 
          nothing, all for nothing, if you do that. I didn't get into this 
          for nothing, so that I could have nothing --
          
          DAVID
          Yeah, and you didn't saw his feet off.
          
          There is silence. David resumes eating.
          
          DAVID
          (CONTINUED)
          It tastes different.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          Alex stands at the sink doing some washing up. He hears footsteps 
          from the loft above. He stops what he is doing and walks slowly 
          out ot the hall.
          
          INT. LOFT. NIGHT
          
          In the darkness we can just make out David's eyes as he sits in 
          darkness.
          
          ALEX
          (calling from below)
          David, David, what are you doing up there?
          
          The torch goes on. David lifts the bag of money from between the 
          rafters. He puts it inside another thick yellow plastic bag, 
          which he ties tightly with string.
          
          David opens the water tank.
          
          Alex's voice can be heard throughout.
          
          ALEX
          (continued; calling from below)
          Will you come down now. It's not safe up there. Are you listening 
          to me. Security and insanity are not the same thing.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          ALEX
          Shit.
          
          INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT
          
          Juliet sits drinking coffee, while Alex sands in the doorway 
          looking up towards the trapdoor.
          
          JULIET
          Leave him alone.
          
          ALEX
          He can't stay up there.
          
          JULIET
          He'll come down. Leave him alone.
          
          ALEX
          Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come 
          down for that?
          
          JULIET
          No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
          
          ALEX
          Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it.
          
          INT. HOSPITAL. DAY
          
          Juliet looks through the door from a small office out into the 
          main waiting area in the casualty departmet. It is busy and there 
          are rooms of people nursing injuries waiting to be seen. More 
          file past the door while she watches with no enthusiasm.
          
          INT. HALL. DAY
          
          The trapdoor opens. David's head appears. He looks around and 
          listens carfeully.
          
          INT. LUMSDEN'S OFFICE. DAY
          
          Lumsden answers his telephone.
          
          INT. HALL. DAY
          
          David speaks on the telephone.
          
          DAVID
          It's my mother, sir, she's very ill and I think I need to be with 
          her just now. I don't know. The doctors aren't sure. It could go 
          either way. Yes, sir, I'll certainly stay in touch.
          
          INT. BATHROOM. DAY
          
          David shaves carefully with a safety razor.
          
          INT. KITCHEN. DAY
          
          Bacon and eggs fry in a pan. David attends to them while drinking 
          from a large tumbler of orange juice.
          
          INT. HOSPITAL. DAY
          
          A Sister hands Juliet a casualty case sheet. Juliet reads it.
          
          JULIET
          Painful groin? What does that mean?
          
          SISTER
          I don't know. He wouldn't show me.
          
          Juliet draws back the curtain of a cubicle. Alex is sitting on a 
          trolly. 
          ALEX
          Boy, am I glad to see you.
          
          JULIET
          What are you doing here?
          
          ALEX
          We have to talk.
          
          JULIET
          Your painful groin?
          
          She turns and walks away. Alex chases after her.
          
          ALEX
          Later. But first -- him.
          
          JULIET
          David?
          
          ALEX
          Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
          
          JULIET
          Oh, good.
          
          ALEX
          He won't do anything for me, but for you --
          
          JULIET
          Forget it.
          
          ALEX
          He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use 
          your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.
          
          JULIET
          And the money?
          
          ALEX
          We could put it somewhere.
          
          JULIET
          Where he can't get it?
          
          ALEX
          Now you thought of that, not me.
          
          JULIET
          Forget it -- he'll come down.
          
          Juliet walks away.
          
          INT. HALL. DAY
          
          The hall is empty and the flat is silent. We see the trapdoor.
          
          INT. LOFT. EVENING
          
          David sits in the darkness. A crack of light penetrates beside 
          the trapdoor.
          
          INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT
          
          Alex and Juliet sit at the table, eating in silence.
          
          The doorbell rings. Alex and Juliet look at one another.
          
          ALEX
          Expecting anyone?
          
          JULIET
          No.
          
          ALEX
          Oh.
          
          Alex resumes eating.
          
          JULIET
          Aren't you going to answer it?
          
          ALEX
          Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.
          
          Juliet glares at him.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          Alex approaches the door and is about to open it. At the last 
          moment he checks himself and looks through the spyhole.
          
          INT. THROUGH THE SPYHOLE. NIGHT
          
          Tim and Andy stand outside the door.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          Alex, slightly puzzled, fixes the security chains before opening 
          the door. As soon as he opens it, the door is kicked wide open as 
          the security chains break off. Tim and Andy enter the flat.
          
          In a whirlwind of force they drag and shove Alex and Juliet into 
          the living room and bind them up with cord. There are no words 
          apart from slightly muffled cries.
          
          At the end of this Andy stands in front of Alex holding a 
          crowbar. Swiftly and without warning, he cracks it across Alex's 
          shins. Then Andy slowly puts one one end of the crowbar into 
          Alex's mouth. For a moment he does nothing, then just as slowly 
          again, he takes the crowbar out.
          
          ALEX
          It's in the loft.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          The trapdoor is closed but the sound of it being unlocked can 
          just be heard (although not by anyone in the flat.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          Tim pulls the ladder across to the trapdoor.
          
          INT. LOFT. NIGHT
          
          It is completely dark in the loft, but as the trapdoor opens a 
          shaft of light strikes upwards and illuminates a small pool 
          around the opening.
          
          INT. LOFT. NIGHT
          
          Away from the trapdoor there appears to be a wall of uniform 
          darkness, but then we see a pair of eyes in the darkness. It is 
          David. He stands perfectly still.
          
          There is a hammer in his right hand.
          
          INT. LOFT. NIGHT
          
          Tim's head appears through the trapdoor. Cautiously he lifts 
          himself through and balances on the beams.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          The hall is empty, but we can see the open trapdoor. Suddenly 
          there is a single thud, as might be caused by a body landing 
          heavily on and across some beams in the loft.
          
          INT. LOFT. NIGHT
          
          David stands motionless in the dark, exactly as before.
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
          
          Andy has heard the single thud. He strains to hear anything else 
          but does not. Slowly he backs away to the door of the living 
          room, keeping the crowbar trained on Alex as he does so. He looks 
          back and up towards the trapdoor.
          
          INT. LOFT. NIGHT
          
          Once again a small pool of light emanates from the open trapdoor. 
          Andy emerges into the front of this, crowbar in hand, peering 
          into the darkness. Carefully he stands up and moves out of the 
          light and steps across the beams. His foot strikes something and 
          he looks down. Tim's body lies spread-eagled beneath him. He 
          looks up. To one side of him is the brass light switch. Andy 
          lifts his arm, reaches towards it and switches it on. Sparks pour 
          out for a moment and then the light comes on for a fraction of a 
          second, long enough for Andy to see David's face is only 
          centimetres from his own.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          Alex and Juliet are bound together as before. There is a loud 
          thud from the ceiling, following by a few heavy steps. Then 
          Andy's body falls headfirst through the trapdoor, straight down 
          to the floor below, landing awkwardly and coming to rest with his 
          head hanging back, looking towards Alex and Juliet. Andy takes 
          one agonal breath and dies. Blood trickles from the side of his 
          mouth.
          
          Tim's body lands on Andy.
          
          David drops himself from the hatch to the floor.
          
          David takes a large knife from a wooden block.
          
          Back in the hall he kneels, holding the knife, beside Tim. 
          Noticing something at the top of tim's neck, he uses the knife to 
          lift away Tim's T-shirt. A tattoo covers Tim's neck. David looks 
          at it, then stands up.
          
          He walks through to the living room, where Alex and Juliet, still 
          bound, watch him approach. He looks at them for a moment, then 
          extends the knife and cuts the cord in one place.
          
          EXT. FOREST. NIGHT
          
          In a scene similar to the dismemberment of Hugo, we see David's 
          shoulders as he saws back and forth at something unseen. He stops 
          and reaches out for the hammer, picks it up and raises it above 
          his head.
          
          EXT. ROAD. DAWN
          
          The van is silhouetted against a rising sun.
          
          INT. BACK OF THE VAN. DAWN
          
          The tools and the yellow sack slide about in the back of the van.
          
          INT. VAN. DAWN
          
          David is driving. Alex and Juliet are huddled silently away from 
          him. David seems quite at ease.
          
          A thick bunch of keys dangles from the ignition. Juliet observes 
          them.
          
          INT. LOFT. DAY
          
          David sits still in the darkness.
          
          INT. NEWSPAPER OFFICE. DAY
          
          Alex sits at his desk fidgeting, about to write something but 
          unable to start. On the screen of his word processor is a page 
          mock-up with the headline CATS EAT PENSIONER'. As the telephone 
          on his desk rings, he is startled, then reaches out, slowly lifts 
          it fractionally and replaces it.
          
          INT. TRAVEL AGENT'S. DAY
          
          Hunched over a VDU, the Salesman is offering Juliet a range of 
          flights.
          
          SALESMAN
          October 15th, direct flight, London Heathrow to Rio de Janeiro, 
          British Airways, you are looking at seven hundred and sixty-five 
          pounds. Seven six five.
          
          JULIET
          That sounds fine.
          
          SALESMAN
          Air Portugal, on the other hand, via Lisbon, same day, five 
          hundred and sixty-five. Five six five. It's up to you. Catering 
          important?
          
          JULIET
          What?
          
          SALESMAN
          Air France. Glasgow. Direct, but then you're looking at the wrong 
          end of nine hundred and twelve pounds. That's nine one two. It's 
          up to you.
          
          JULIET
          Yes, the first one's fine. Heathrow direct.
          
          SALESMAN
          It's up to you. Air Patagonia. New outfit: via Caracas and Bogot 
          . No catering. Four hundred and eleven pounds. Four one one. Good 
          value, but refueling at Bogot is variable.
          
          JULIET
          The first one was fine.
          
          SALESMAN
          Well, it's up to you. Seven six five. How will you be paying?
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          The hall is empty but we can hear David's footsteps on the beams 
          above.
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
          
          Alex sits watching The Wicker Man on televison. He can hear the 
          footsteps above. He turns the sound up on the television so that 
          he cannot hear them, but he keeps looking up at the ceiling, as 
          though he expects to hear them or see somwthing.
          
          Eventually he turns the sound back down and, after a moment's 
          silence, the footsteps start again, back and forth, then stop.
          
          Alex looks up.
          
          Without warning there is the sound of an electric drill.
          
          The blade of the drill appears through the ceiling and is then 
          withdrawn. Alex is shocked. Other drill holes appear.
          
          INT. VARIOUS CEILINGS. NIGHT
          
          Holes are drilled in the ceilings.
          
          INT. LOFT. NIGHT
          
          Rods of light penetrate up from the holes, interrupting but not 
          obliterating the darknes. David sits back, pleased with his work.
          
          INT. JULIET'S ROOM. NIGHT
          
          Juliet sits at her desk. Alex stands in the doorway. He is about 
          to speak. Juliet raises a finger to her lips. They both look at 
          the ceiling.
          
          EXT. GARDEN AT FRONT OF THE FLAT. NIGHT
          
          Establishing shot of Alex and Juliet in garden.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          The trapdoor is open.
          
          INT. ALEX'S ROOM. NIGHT
          
          David is searching through Alex's desk, looking through letters 
          and folders, then shoving them back into drawers.
          
          EXT. GARDEN AT THE FRONT OF THE FLAT. NIGHT
          
          ALEX
          No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it 
          further.
          
          JULIET
          It's the only way.
          
          ALEX
          I refuse.
          
          JULIET
          You're frightened.
          
          ALEX
          No, I'm not frightened. A little terrified maybe. Did you see 
          what happened to the last two who tried that? They went up alive 
          and they came down dead -- the difference, I mean, alive dead 
          dead alive, that sort of thing. It wasn't difficult to spot. He 
          killed them both: he cut them up.
          
          INT. JULIET'S ROOM. NIGHT
          
          David is now searching through Juliet's desk. He picks up a large 
          brown envelope and looks into it. Beneath it is the airline 
          ticket envelope.
          
          The doorbell rings.
          
          INT. THROUGH THE SPYHOLE. NIGHT
          
          McCall and Mitchell stand outside the door.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          David opens the door. McCall smiles.
          
          MCCALL
          Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC 
          Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.
          
          DAVID
          What about?
          
          MCCALL
          It's about the burglary.
          
          DAVID
          Burglary?
          
          MCCALL
          Downstairs.
          
          DAVID
          Of course.
          
          MCCALL
          Can we come in?
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
          
          David sits on the sofa while the two policemen sit on armchairs 
          several feet apart.
          
          DAVID
          So I just heard her cries for help and all that, and when I went 
          downstairs there were already those other people there, so I just 
          stood around really, waiting -- you know how people do -- and 
          then when your colleagues arrived I came back upstairs. And 
          that's about all, I think. I didn't actually see anything useful, 
          I don't think.
          
          MCCALL
          did you hear anything before he cries?
          
          DAVID
          No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
          
          MCCALL
          Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the 
          last few days?
          
          DAVID
          No, nothing, sorry.
          
          MCCALL
          Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
          
          DAVID
          Of course.
          
          MCCALL
          And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
          
          DAVID
          There are only two other people in the flat. 
          
          McCall consults a notebook.
          
          MCCALL
          Two?
          
          DAVID
          Who said there were four?
          
          MCCALL
          We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of 
          course, but now, four.
          
          DAVID
          No, three. Who said there were four?
          
          MCCALL
          How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading 
          information. Only three people here. You're sure?
          
          DAVID
          Yes, absolutely.
          
          MCCALL
          Take a note of that, Mitchell. Only three, rather than four. 
          Write it down. You can use numbers or words, I have no 
          preference. Which are you using?
          
          MITCHELL
          Both, sir.
          
          MCCALL
          Excellent. DC Mitchell is a rising star, Mr. Stevens. Under my 
          tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade.
          
          DAVID
          I see.
          
          MCCALL
          I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?
          
          DAVID
          No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
          
          MCCALL
          Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
          
          DAVID
          I don't know. Maybe I'm a light sleeper.
          
          Uncomfortably, David realizes that Mitchell has noted down even 
          this last, trivial remark in a painful longhand and has 
          underlined a short segment of it.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          In the hallway of the flat Mitchell stands at the open main door, 
          waiting to leave. McCall is kneeling at the door to Hugo's room, 
          tracing his finger down the broken lintel and lock. David looks 
          on.
          
          MCCALL
          Loks like you had a break-in up here as well.
          
          DAVID
          Someone lost the key.
          
          McCall gently pushes the door open and the light from the hall 
          illuminates Hugo's room.
          
          MCCALL
          Is this where no one stays?
          
          DAVID
          Yeah, that's right, that's it.
          
          David notices that Mitchell is writing this down.
          
          INT. GARDEN AT FRONT OF THE FLAT. NIGHT
          
          ALEX
          You'll wait in the hall?
          
          JULIET
          I'll wait there.
          
          ALEX
          And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, 
          you'll tell them everything?
          
          JULIET
          Everything.
          
          ALEX
          Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the 
          first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die 
          misunderstood. 
          
          JULIET
          Alex.
          
          ALEX
          What?
          
          JULIET
          As smart as you are, you'll need a little help.
          
          She hands Alex a Yale key. Alex stares at it.
          
          INT. LOFT. NIGHT
          
          In the darkness, the sound of the lock being turned is heard.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          Alex tsands at the top of the ladder, holding the key in the 
          trapdoor lock.
          
          ALEX
          All right, David, what I'm going to do is, I'm going to open this 
          lock and I'm going to come up, and what's important is that you 
          remain calm.
          
          There is one light on. Juliet stands at the bottom of the ladder. 
          Having opened the trapdoor, Alex stops and listens, but there is 
          no sound above his own breathing. Juliet throws up a torch, which 
          he catches. He switches it on. It shines, then goes out, and he 
          knocks it against the ladder, making it work again. Slowly he 
          pushes the trapdoor open.
          
          INT. LOFT. NIGHT
          
          The trapdoor opens. Below it, Alex crouches on the ladder, 
          expecting attack at any moment. He looks back down to Juliet, who 
          returns his gaze, then he slowly raises himself into the loft.
          
          He turns around quickly, darting the torchlight around into 
          corners and squinting in the darkness, but he sees nothing.
          
          The torch goes out. Cursing, he knocks it against a beam and it 
          shines again.
          
          Slowly he moves further from the trapdoor into the centre of the 
          loft, still turning around and worried about what might be behind 
          him.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          Juliet stands waiting, braced for sounds of conflict.
          
          INT. LOFT. NIGHT
          
          Alex is still looking but has relaxed a little, feeling les in 
          danger. In one corner he notices David's pile of left-possessions 
          and the mat on which he has been sleeping. He moves towards it.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          Juliet stands, still waiting.
          
          INT. LOFT. NIGHT
          
          Alex stands in David's corner. With another sweep of the torch he 
          can still see nothing. He calls to Juliet.
          
          ALEX
          He isn't up here.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          A close-up of Juliet's face, just as David's hand slams across 
          her mouth, gripping her tightly while his other hand clamps on 
          the back of her head. David's mouth is right up against her ear 
          as he spits a warning into it.
          
          DAVID
          Tell him to look for the money.
          
          Slowly, David relaxes his grip on Juliet.
          
          JULIET
          Look for the money.
          
          INT. LOFT. NIGHT
          
          Alex, cheerful now, is looking in the rafters.
          
          ALEX
          Don't worry, that's what I'm doing.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          David holds Juliet across her face again. She is terrified and 
          does not struggle.
          
          DAVID
          Expecting anyone?
          
          JULIET
          What?
          
          DAVID
          Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
          
          JULIET
          No.
          
          DAVID
          Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
          
          JULIET
          No one. I promise.
          
          DAVID
          Who have you talked to?
          
          JULIET
          No one.
          
          DAVID
          If I think you're lying --
          
          INT. LOFT. NIGHT
          
          Alex stands gazing around the loft.
          
          ALEX
          (from the loft)
          Well, it's not up here.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          David pulls Juliet to one side.
          
          INT. LOFT. NIGHT
          
          Alex is about to descend when he notices the water tank. He walks 
          over and lifts the lid. His face breaks into a smile as he 
          realizes what it holds. He dips an arm into the tank, raises the 
          yellow bag, then quickly lowers it again. Alex steps back from 
          the water tank.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          Alex appears at the top of the ladder. Without looking, he slides 
          down as quickly as he can, calling out as he does so.
          
          ALEX
          Juliet, I have --
          
          Alex reaches the base of the ladder. He turns around to find 
          himself facing the blade of the battery-operated drill, held by 
          David. Juliet stands off to one side.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          -- a problem.
          
          David holds the drill even closer until it is almost touching the 
          centre of Alex's forehead and presses the trigger' to turn the 
          blade slowly as he speaks.
          
          Alex does not move at all.
          
          DAVID
          You looking for me?
          
          ALEX
          Looking for you? Yes.
          
          DAVID
          What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
          
          ALEX
          We just wanted to speak to you.
          
          Alex's hands and sleeves are wet. A few drops of water fall from 
          his fingertips. Unnoticed by the other two, he slowly wipes his 
          hands on the back of his jeans.
          
          DAVID
          Who else have you wanted to speak to? Maybe you thought they'd 
          already got me.
          
          The blade os the drill scrapes Alex's skin.
          
          ALEX
          Who?
          
          DAVID
          Your friends.
          
          ALEX
          I don't know what you're talking about.
          
          JULIET
          He doesn't know David.
          
          David holds the drill back slightly while he thinks. It could go 
          either way.
          
          DAVID
          Well, maybe you don't --
          
          David lowers the drill and smiles.
          
          DAVID
          (CONTINUED)
          I'm talking about the police.
          
          INT. ALEX'S ROOM. DAY
          
          Alex has just woken up. He rubs his forehead. There is a nick in 
          it, where the drill has scratched. He rubs at it and examines the 
          drop of blood on the end of his finger.
          
          INT. DAVID'S POINT OF VIEW. ALEX'S ROOM. DAY
          
          Looking down from a hole in the ceiling, we see into Alex's room, 
          where he is getting dressed.
          
          INT. HALL. DAY
          
          Alex leaves his room and enters the hall.
          
          INT. LOFT. DAY
          
          Looking down from a hole in the ceiling, we see into Alex's room, 
          where he is getting dressed.
          
          INT. LOFT/HALL. DAY
          
          Looking down on Alex as he leaves the flat and closes the door.
          
          INT. LOFT. DAY
          
          David scurries back across the beams to look down through another 
          hole. He looks for several seconds.
          
          NOTE In the following sequence, Juliet's face is not seen until 
          her comment on it. 
          INT. JULIET'S ROOM. DAY
          
          Juliet lies on her bed. She throws the covers back.
          
          INT. LOFT. DAY
          
          David is still looking down through the hole.
          
          INT. JULIET'S ROOM. DAY
          
          Juliet moves about her room. She is wearing a large, baggy T-
          shirt.
          
          INT. LOFT. DAY
          
          David still watching.
          
          INT. JULIET'S ROOM. DAY
          
          Juliet's legs are seen as the T-shirt lands on the floor beside 
          them.
          
          INT. LOFT. DAY
          
          David sits back suddenly, recoiling from the activity. He 
          scrambles back across to his mat, where he sits back down and 
          closes his eyes. Then he opens them and scrambles back to look 
          down again.
          
          INT. JULIET'S ROOM. DAY
          
          The room is empty.
          
          The sound of the flat door closing is heard.
          
          From David's point of view we see:
          
          INT. LOFT/HALL (EMPTY). DAY
          
          INT. LOFT/LIVING ROOM (EMPTY). DAY
          
          INT. LOFT/KITCHEN (EMPTY). DAY
          
          INT. HALL. DAY
          
          David's head appears beneath the trapdoor. He hangs from the 
          hatch and drops down to the floor.
          
          INT. BATHROOM. DAY
          
          David showers.
          
          INT. HALL. DAY
          
          David emerges from the bathroom and walks towards the kitchen. We 
          follow him in.
          
          INT. KITCHEN. DAY
          
          David takes orange juice out of the fridge and pours himself a 
          glass. He sits at the table and looks briefly into a corner that 
          we cannot see. The expression oh his face does not change and his 
          voice is impassive.
          
          DAVID
          I thought you'd gone to work.
          
          JULIET
          (UNSEEN)
          With a face like this?
          
          INT. KITCHEN. DAY
          
          Juliet's face. There are bruises across it where she was gripped 
          by David.
          
          INT. MONITOR SCREEN/NEWSPAPER OFFICE. DAY
          
          In close-up we track along the following half-sentence: In the 
          event of my death I want the following facts to be known:' --
          
          The remainder of the screen is blank.
          
          Alex sits at his desk, deciding what to type next on the screen 
          seen before. A young Office Boy approaches his desk.
          
          OFFICE BOY
          The editor wants to see you.
          
          INT. KITCHEN. MORNING
          
          David sits while Juliet talks. She is now seated behind him.
          
          JULIET
          I remember how things used to be here, and I see how they are 
          now, and I don't know why it is. I don't know how we let you 
          become like this. We were your friends and we should have looked 
          after you.
          
          INT. EDITOR'S OFFICE. DAY
          
          Alex sits nervously while the Editor sits on the side of his 
          desk.
          
          EDITOR
          Out in the woods. Three bodies. Decomposed. Mutilated. Beyond 
          recognition.
          
          ALEX
          I don't know anything about it.
          
          EDITOR
          Of course you don't know anything about it. If you knew anything 
          about it, I wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it.
          
          ALEX
          Cover it?
          
          EDITOR
          Well?
          
          ALEX
          But there's no --
          
          EDITOR
          Animals involved? I know, but you need a change. And besides, 
          we're short.
          
          ALEX
          I don't know.
          
          EDITOR
          Don't know what?
          
          ALEX
          Well, I've got this story, it's really good, I'm working on, that 
          is good, I feel it could be big, it this, eh, and it's, you know, 
          it's incredible. Am I right, did you say beyond recognition'?
          
          INT. KITCHEN. DAY
          
          David and Juliet are seated as before.
          
          DAVID
          I'm sorry.
          
          JULIET
          I should hope so.
          
          david turns towards her. He reaches out and softly touches her 
          face.
          
          DAVID
          Maybe we can still sort everything out.
          
          Juliet takes his hand.
          
          JULIET
          We can try.
          
          They look at one another.
          
          EXT. FOREST. DAY
          
          Several police and unmarked vehicles, including one mobile 
          incident room', stand on a rough track. Another car arrives at 
          the end and is parkeed to one side. Alex steps out.
          
          From where he stands, Alex can see towards the site of the 
          burials. There are a few policemen, uniformed and plain-clothes, 
          and a small knot of journalists, kept at bay by plastic tape 
          draped from tree to tree. Mounds of earth mark the site of the 
          exhumations.
          
          Alex walks past the other journalists into the woods. He looks 
          back towards the sight, then turns to look in the opposite 
          direction. He finds himself at the edge of a golf course. From 
          the green to the graves is hardly any distance.
          
          To one side, Alex sees McCall and Mitchell, hunched in earnest 
          discussion. Mitchell looks up briefly and ctaches Alex's eye.
          
          BINT. KITCHEN/HALL. DAY
          
          The kitchen is empty. We track through the kitchen and out into 
          the hall, stopping at the door to Juliet's room.
          
          INT. JULIET'S ROOM. DAY
          
          David and Juliet are seated on the bed. Among the junk on her 
          bedside table is the Polaroid photograph of Alex, propped up 
          against a tumbler. Juliet reaches out and turns it away before 
          pulling David towards her.
          
          INT. MOBILE INCIDENT ROOM. DAY
          
          Several journalists sit close together on plastic chairs. Alex 
          sits at the back, near the half-open door. At the other end, 
          three police officers face them. They are a medium-ranking 
          Uniformed Officer, and to one side of him Mitchell and then 
          McCall, both of whom sit in silence.
          
          UNIFORMED OFFICER
          All right, ladies and gentlemen, the releasable and print-worthy 
          facts of the day so far are as follows. Late yesterdat afternoon, 
          forestry workers came across one set of human remains lying in a 
          grave which appeared to have been recently dug. Further 
          excavation on our part has revealed two similar, deeper graves, 
          again containing human remains.
          
          Alex turns his head and looks out of the door towards the burial 
          site, now enclosed in a plastic tent. He continues to stare at 
          it.
          
          While Alex is looking, the sound of laughter and Uniformed 
          Officer's subsequent comments become muted and we hear the memory 
          of a sound in Alex's head: it is the noise of the saw going back 
          and forth across the victim's limbs.
          
          UNIFORMED OFFICER
          (CONTINUED)
          As and when the corpses are removed, we will endeavour to 
          ascertain the mode of death and duration of burial, as well as 
          identification, which will of course be passed on to you after 
          informing, where possible, the next of kin.
          
          Alex discreetly stands up and slips out of the van.
          
          EXT. FOREST. DAY
          
          Alex walks away from the incident room towards his car. He breaks 
          into a run for a few paces.
          
          The noise of the sawing continues.
          
          As he reaches his car, Alex fumbles in his pockets for his keys. 
          He is sweating and trembling. He drops his keys. As he bends down 
          to pick them up, his foot slips on the wet grass. He falls to his 
          knees, his forehead banging against the car door. He kneels for a 
          moment, gripping the keys, his head resting against the door.
          
          The noise of the sawing stops.
          
          From behind, the arm of a Police Constable reaches out and his 
          hand rests on Alex's shoulder.


          THE END
