                        WHO SHOT ROGER RABBIT?

     This movie starts the way all movies should... with a
     cartoon.  It's not a Disney or a Warner's.  It's not a
     Fleischer, an MGM, or a Lanz.  This is a lesser known
     studio.


     FADE IN:

     ON A "MAROON CARTOON"

     Accompanied by zany CARTOON MUSIC, the TITLE CARD reads:

                   MAROON CARTOONS PRESENT
                BABY HERMAN AND ROGER RABBIT
                           IN
                      "THE BUNNYSITTER"

     Below are two cameos of the cartoon's stars.  One picture is
     of a cherubic baby in a bonnet innocently posed with his
     thumb in his mouth.  The other is of a paunchy rabbit with a
     gap between his front teeth.  He has a loveable, if slightly
     shell-shocked look.  The cartoon begins...


     BABY HERMAN AND ROGER RABBIT

     are in a playpen when TWO FEMALE LEGS in high heels walk INTO
     FRAME.  The VOICE belonging to the legs talks down to Baby
     Herman in a maternal coo.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
               Mommy's going to the beauty parlor,
               darling.  But I'm leaving you with your
               favorite friend, Roger.  He's going to
               take very, very good care of you...
                      (voice turns
                       ominous)
               ... cause if he doesn't, he's going
               back to the science lab!

     Roger gulps as he watches the legs disappear.  We HEAR
     FOOTSTEPS recede and a DOOR SLAM.  Roger turns confidently
     back to his charge.  But the little tyke is already squeezing
     through the playpen bars.

                               BABY HERMAN
               Baby bye-bye...

     Roger makes a dive for him, misses, and gets his head stuck
     between the bars.  He pleads with the Baby in a voice that
     resonates of Huntz Hall in "The Bowery Boys".

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hey, come back!  You heard what your
               mother said!


     BABY HERMAN

     ignores Roger.  We FOLLOW HIM as he crawls into the kitchen.
     He stops to regard something that has caught his attention...
     a cookie jar.  It's sitting on top of the refrigerator.

                               BABY HERMAN
               Coo-kie.


     ROGER

     wearing the playpen like a pillory, comes running toward the
     kitchen.  But the playpen is too wide to clear the door.  The
     impact SHATTERING the playpen and sends Roger sprawling
     across the kitchen floor.  When he looks up...


     BABY HERMAN

     is swinging precariously on the door of the freeer.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hang on, Baby.  I'll save you!

     Roger makes a desperate leap across the kitchen for the kid.
     But Baby Herman swings the door to the freezer open and Roger
     disappears inside.  Baby Herman grabs a cookie and swings
     back, shutting the door.  He climbs down and crawls out of
     the kitchen.  After a beat, the freezer door opens.


     ROGER

     now shaped like a block of ice, falls out and hits the floor.
     The block SHATTERS into ice cubes.  Roger looks around,
     dazed.


     BABY HERMAN

     has taken this opportunity to crawl out the window.  Roger
     races to the window.  His eyes pop out of his head at what he
     sees.


     ROGER'S POV

     Baby Herman is crawling along the sidewalk under the shadow
     of a safe being hoisted into a second floor window by the
     Acme Safe Moving Company.  The rope holding the safe is
     fraying down to a slender thread.


     ROGER

     gasps and rockets out the window toward Baby Herman.  The
     rope snaps.  The safe falls.  Roger arrives just in time to
     pluck the Baby out of harm's way.  But not in time to save
     himself.  The safe CRUNCHES down on his head, burying Roger
     into the sidewalk.  After a beat, Roger's hand appears and
     spins the tumbler.  The safe door opens.  Inside, we see the
     dazed rabbit with little TWEETING BIRDS circling his head.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
               Cut, cut, cut!

     The cartoon action stops abruptly, but the goofy CARTOON
     MUSIC PLAYS ON.  We begin a slow PULL BACK TO REVEAL that
     this cartoon is being filmed LIVE ON A SOUND STAGE.  The
     title card sits on an easle.  The female legs are paper
     mache' props manipulated by two HUMAN CREW MEMBERS.  Wearily,
     they lean the legs up against the stage wall.  A human
     DIRECTOR, wearing a tweed jacket and baggy pleated pants,
     steps onto the set.  From the equipment and the dress of the
     crew, we can tell it's the 1940's.  Baby Herman throws his
     cookie down in disgust.  He talks in a gravelly voice an
     octave lower than Wallace Beery's.

                               BABY HERMAN
               What the hell was wrong with that
               take??

                               DIRECTOR
               Nothin' with you, Baby Herman.  It's on
               Roger... again!
                      (over shoulder)
               Hey!  Could we lose the playback?

     The MUSIC suddenly STOPS as, off to the side, the SOUNDMAN
     lifts the needle off a phonograph record.  The Director leans
     over Roger and angrily plucks one of the birds circling his
     head.

                               DIRECTOR
                      (continuing)
               What's this, Roger?

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (sheepish)
               A tweeting bird?

                               DIRECTOR
               That's right, a tweeting bird.  But
               what does the script say?  'Rabbit gets
               conked.  Rabbit sees stars!'  Not
               birds, stars!

                               BABY HERMAN
               Aw, for cryin' out loud, Roger!  I'll
               be in my trailer... takin' a nap!

     Baby Herman pulls himself up to his full height of two feet
     and walks off the set.  He chooses a route that takes him
     under the dress of the SCRIPT GIRL.  She jumps as if goosed.
     Now two CREW MEMBERS lift the safe off Roger.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars,
               I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my
               head one more time.

                               DIRECTOR
               I've already dropped it on you
               twenty-three times.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Don't worry about me.  I can take it.

                               DIRECTOR
               I'm not worried about you.  I'm worried
               about the safe.

     CONTINUED PULLBACK.

     What we've been seeing has been from the POV of a MAN in a
     shiny brown suit standing unobtrusively at the back of the
     sound stage.  Under a beat-up fedora is a craggy face that's
     seen a lot in its life... but apparently didn't think much of
     it was funny.  EDDIE VALIANT takes a jolt from a pint of
     whiskey, evidently in reaction to what he's seen.  He opens
     his coat and returns the pint bottle to a shoulder holster
     which had formerly held a .38.  Nerves steadied, he walks out
     the stage door.


     EXT. MAROON STUDIO - DAY

     Valiant emerges from the stage onto a bustling Hollywood
     studio lot where CARTOON CHARACTERS (TOONS) and humans are
     comingling as if it were the most natural thing in the world.
     Valiant stops by an Acme Novelty truck which is unloading
     Toon props.  There are bombs, rockets, flattened pocket
     watches, anvils, giant slingshots, etcetera.  The license
     plate is California 1946.  He fishes out a pack of
     Chesterfields and taps out a half a butt that had been
     stubbed out.  As he lights it, Valiant regards a chubby,
     balding man wearing a three-piece suit and a worried
     expression coming towards him.  He is R.K. MAROON, studio
     boss.  Maroon is leading an entourage of ASSISTANTS trying to
     keep up.

                               MAROON
               Starting tomorrow there'll be no more
               roast beef lunches.  What happened to
               cheese sandwiches?  I was raised on
               cheese sandwiches.

     As the Assistants dutifully record his thoughts, Maroon sees
     a GUY taking a nap in the shade of a palm tree.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               And tell that guy sleepin' over there
               he's fired!
 
                               ASSISTANT
               It's your wife's brother, R.K.

                               MAROON
                      (reconsiders)
               Oh... tell him he's promoted.  But get
               him out of my sight.

     As the Assistants disperse, Maroon approaches Valiant.

                               MAROON
               Valiant, did you see the rabbit?

                               VALIANT
               He was blowin' his lines, all right.
               So what?

                               MAROON
               So what?  He's already put me three
               weeks behind on the shooting schedule!

     Now an EDITH HEAD-TYPE hustles up to show Maroon several
     costume designs.

                               COSTUMER
               Your reaction, R.K.?

     Maroon quickly checks out the drawing.

                               MAROON
               No!  That's not funny.
 
     She flips another drawing.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               That's funny.  Put a homburg on him
               it'll even be funnier.  Huh, Valiant?

     He grabs the pad and shows Valiant.  The rendering is of a
     hippo in a pink polka-dot tu-tu.

                               VALIANT
                      (deadpan)
               Yeah, that'd be a riot.

     Maroon responds to Valiant's sarcasm with raised eyebrows.

                               MAROON
               Boy, I hope what you have ain't
               contagious or I'll be out of business.

     He hands the pad back to the designer, who departs.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               How much do you know about show
               business, Valiant?

                               VALIANT
               Only there's no business like it, no
               business I know.

     Valiant watches an ALLIGATOR in a rebel uniform dragging a
     brace of cannons and several TOADSTOOLS parade by.

                               MAROON
               Yeah, and there's no business as
               expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over
               budget on the latest Bunnysitter
               cartoon and it's all because that
               rabbit can't keep his mind on his work.
               And you know why?

                               VALIANT
               One too many safes dropped on his head?

                               MAROON
               Nah, that goes with the territory.
               He's a stunt bunny.

     Maroon takes a copy of the "Hollywood Tattler" out of his
     pocket.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               Here's the problem...
                      (reads)
               "Seen cooing over calamari with
               notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica
               Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger".
                      (looks up)
               His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's
               Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him
               up.

                               VALIANT
               So what do you want me to do?

                               MAROON
               Get me a couple juicy pictures.
               Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up
               with.

                               VALIANT
               I don't work in Toontown.

                               MAROON
               You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife
               sings at an underground Toon revue
               joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You
               can catch her in action there.

                               VALIANT
               The job's gonna cost you a hundred
               bucks.

                               MAROON
               A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.

                               VALIANT
               So's the job.

     Valiant starts to walk away.

                               MAROON
               All right, all right... You got your
               hundred bucks.

     Maroon turns, snaps his fingers.  His Assistant appears out
     of nowhere with Maroon's checkbook and a pen.  The Assistant
     turns and stoops so that Maroon can write the check on his
     back.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               Fifty now, fifty when you deliver the
               pictures.

     Maroon tears the check off and hands it to Valiant.  Suddenly
     Valiant ducks in reflex to a large shadow that passes
     overhead.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing;
                       chuckles)
               Kinda jumpy aren't you, Valiant?  It's
               just Dumbo.


     ABOVE THEIR HEADS - DUMBO

     swoops back and forth, then hovers, ears flapping like a
     hummingbird.

                               MAROON
               I got him on loan from Disney.

                               VALIANT
               Aren't you the lucky one...

     Valiant grabs the check from Maroon and starts for the gate.

                               MAROON
               When will I hear from you?

                               VALIANT
               As soon as is humanly possible.

     We FOLLOW Valiant out the gate under a wrought iron sign that
     reads "Maroon Cartoon Studios".  As he starts across the road
     he's almost run over by a Toon roadster that ROARS out of the
     gates.  When it BLASTS ITS HORN, it's the FIRST FIVE NOTES
     from the WOODY WOODPECKER SONG:  "HA-HA-HA-HA-HA".  Valiant
     jumps back as the roadster passes.  WOODY THE WOODPECKER'S
     behind the wheel with a self-important smile on his face.
     Valiant angrily waves the cloud of Toon dust away.

                               VALIANT
                      (coughs)
               Damn Toons.


     ACROSS THE STREET - A TROLLEY CAR

     is slowing to a stop in front of the studio.  It's a Pacific
     and Electric "Red Car", part of a vast system of electric
     trollies that once criss-crossed the L.A. Basin.  Valiant
     steps onto the "Red Car".  He reaches into his pocket to give
     the CONDUCTOR his nickel fare.  But he comes up with a
     handful of lint.  He holds out the check.

                               CONDUCTOR
               What do I look like, a bank?

     The Conductor jerks his thumb toward the door.  Valiant
     suffers the public humiliation,of having to step down past
     the rest of the boarding passengers.  He walks around to the
     back of the Red Car where a gang of TEN-YEAR-OLDS are
     loitering.  When the BELL SOUNDS and the Red Car starts to
     pull away, the Kids make a dash for a place on the cow
     catcher.  Valiant joins them.  We HOLD as the Red Car moves
     away and the street urchins regard their older partner in
     crime with curiosity.

                                              DISSOLVE TO:


     A BILLBOARD SIGN

     It reads:  "L.A.'s Pacific and Electric Red Car -- America's
     Finest Public Transportation System".  PAN DOWN to see that
     the sign is on the roof of the trolley terminal.  Red Cars
     are going in and out of the shed.  MOVE IN on one car
     approaching the terminal from down the street.  As it passes
     by...


     VALIANT

     hops off his freeloader's seat on the back,

                               KID
               So long, mister.

     Valiant waves laconically.

                               VALIANT
               Thanks for the cigarettes.

     We FOLLOW Valiant as he crosses the street to a seedy
     bungalow.  A note is push-pinned to the door.


     CLOSE - NOTE

     It says:  "Tomorrow's Friday... Well?  Dolores".


     VALIANT

     takes the note and walks back across the street toward the
     terminal.  He climbs up a flight of stairs, heading for a bar
     on the mezzanine.  The bar sports a red neon sign that used
     to blink, "The Terminal Station Bar".  But now it just says,
     "Terminal".


     INT. TERMINAL BAR - DAY

     The place must have been pretty swanky at the turn of the
     century when it was built in the first burst of enthusiasm
     over the new public transportation system.  It's in the motif
     of a trolley car.  There's a large map on the wail above the
     bar showing all the different lines.  Behind the bar is
     DOLORES.  If you scraped off all the makeup, you'd find an
     attractive woman in her late thirties.  She ministers to a
     rag-tag assortment of Hollywood low-lifes -- who are truly at
     the end of the line.


     VALIANT

     enters this den, lets his eyes adjust for a moment, then
     bellies up to the bar.  He finds a spot between a ONE-ARMED
     BLACK SOLDIER and a MIDGET stretched out on the bar passed
     out.  Now a TROLLEY RUMBLES underneath them.  The bar starts
     to shake like an earthquake, the lights flicker.  All the
     drinkers, observing a time honored ritual, lift their glasses
     simultaneously to avoid spilling any drops.  Even the Midget
     lifts his head until the trolley has passed.  Valiant reaches
     over the bar and blind-grabs a bottle of rye he obviously
     knows is there.  He pours himself a shot.

                               VALIANT
               Hey, fellas, what's the good word?

                               SOLDIER
               Lost my job.

     An ARTHRITIC COWBOY pipes up.

                               COWBOY
               Mule died.

     A DEAF-MUTE scribbles a note on a pad hanging around his
     neck.  He hands the note to Valiant.  It says "My girl dumped
     me".  Valiant pats him on the back, consoling.

                               VALIANT
               Well, you know what they say about
               dames, Augie...

     Then Valiant mouths the rest of it for Augie's benefit only.
     Augie reads his lips, then starts to roar silently, slapping
     his thigh.  Now Dolores makes her way down the bar.  She
     grabs the Midget by the suspenders and slides him out of the
     way.

                               DOLORES
               So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie?
               Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a
               dame who took a hundred bucks out of
               the till so your landlord would't
               throw you out of your dump.  And it was
               a dame who trusted you for the money
               when no one else in town would.  And
               it's a dame who's tired of waitin' for
               you to straighten yourself out and get
               a job!

                               VALIANT
               Would this be the same dame who's going
               to feel awfully foolish when she finds
               out I've got her money.

     Valiant slides the check across the bar.  Dolores studies it.
     She calms down a little.

                               DOLORES
               This is fifty bucks.  I need
               seventy-five before they check the
               books tomorrow.

                               VALIANT
               You'll have it in the morning.  Now be
               a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to
               put in my pocket.

                               DOLORES
               Is this paper even good?

                               VALIANT
               Check the scrawl.

                               DOLORES
                      (reads)
               R.K. Maroon.

     Now ANGELO, a Neanderthal sitting a few stools down, is
     tapping the shell of a hardboiled egg.

                               ANGELO
               Maroon?  Valiant, don't tell me you're
               workin' for a Toon?  Who's your client?
               Chilly Willy or Screwy Squirrel?

     Angelo chuckles at his own joke and goes to eat his egg.
     Suddenly Valiant darkens.  He grabs Angelo by the shirt and
     pulls him up to his face.

                               VALIANT
               Get this straight, greaseball.  I'm not
               workin' for a Toon!  I'd never work for
               a Toon!  Got that?

     Valiant jams the whole egg into Angelo's mouth, turns and
     storms out the door.  Angelo sputters and spits out the egg.

                               ANGELO
               What's his problem?

                               DOLORES
               Toon killed his brother.


     EXT. INK & PAINT CLUB - NIGHT

     Valiant knocks on the door of, a non-descript building in a
     run-down factory area.  A speakeasy style peephole slides
     open REVEALING the face of a TOON GORILLA.  Valiant offers
     the password.

                               VALIANT
               Walt sent me.

     The peephole slides closed and after a beat the door swings
     open.


     INT. CLUB

     The Gorilla, dressed in a tux, gives Valiant the once over.
     Valiant resents the assessment.

                               VALIANT
               Like your monkey suit.

                               GORILLA
               Wise ass...

     We FOLLOW Valiant down the hall toward the main room.  We can
     HEAR LAUGHTER and ZANY MUSIC from within.


     INT. MAIN ROOM

     When Valiant steps through the doorway, we see the place is
     no dive.  It's a white tablecloth nightclub on a par with the
     El Morroco or the Garden of Allah.  Behind the bar A
     CATERPILLAR BARTENDER is using his many arms to shake and
     pour several drinks at once.  Meanwhile a dozen PENGUIN
     WAITERS are gliding back and forth along the tables serving
     drinks to the well-heeled crowd.


     ON STAGE

     DONALD DUCK and DAFFY DUCK are seated opposite each other at
     matching grand pianos.  What begins as a decorous Duck duet
     on a Tchaikovsky piece (complete with knuckle-cracking,
     seat-spinning preparations) quickly accelerates to a loony
     game of one-upsmanship between these two irascible Ducks.
     There is keyboard stomping, lid-banging, piano wire plucking
     zaniness.


     THE AUDIENCE

     is HOWLING.  People are wiping the tears from their eyes
     they're laughing so hard.  All except...


     VALIANT

     He lights a cigarette impassively, not humored by the Toon
     hijinx.  He spots an empty table off to the side and makes
     his way towards it.  A SILLY GEEZER in a loud suit is at the
     next table.  The Geezer nods to him soberly as Valiant pulls
     Out the chair and sits down.  A LOUD FLATULENCE SOUND erupts
     from under Valiant.  The Geezer slaps his thigh with the
     hilarity of it all.

                               GEEZER
               Will you listen to that?  It's a pip!
               I'm thinking of callin' it a Whoopee
               Cushion.

     Valiant reaches under himself and comes up holding a deflated
     rubber bladder.  The Geezer retrieves it from him.

                               GEEZER
                       (continuing)
                No hard feelings, I hope.  Put 'er
                there...

     The Geezer grabs Valiant's hand before he can say no.  We
     HEAR A BUZZ.  Valiant retracts his hand as if shocked.  The
     Geezer howls with laughter and turns his palm to Eddie.

                               GEEZER
                      (continuing)
               Hand buzzer... real gasser.

     Valiant rolls his eyes and grabs a Penguin as it glides by.

                               VALIANT
               Scotch.

                               PENGUIN
               There's a two drink minimum.

                               VALIANT
               Just as long as there's no maximum.

                               GEEZER
               Waiter, I'll sign my check now.

     The Penguin puts a bill down on the Geezer's table and zips
     off.  The Geezer takes a fountain pen out of his jacket and
     writes on the bill.  But there doesn't seem to be any ink
     coming out.  He shakes and shakes the pen to get it flowing.
     It flows all right.  Ink splatters all over Valiant's shirt
     and pants.  Valiant looks down at the stain, doing a slow
     burn.  The Geezer starts laughing.  Valiant jumps up and
     grabs him by the lapels.

                               VALIANT
               That's it for you, pops!

                               GEEZER
                      (freaked)
               Calm down, son.  Look, the ink is gone.

     Valiant looks down at his shirt.  The stain is gone.

                               GEEZER
                      (continuing)
               See?  It disappears.

                               VALIANT
               Well, why don't you make like the ink?

     Valiant drops him into his chair and returns to his seat.
     The Penguin glides up with his drinks.  Valiant swallows the
     first one with one quick jerk of the head.


     ON STAGE

     Donald and Daffy's PIANO COMPETITION has reached a CRESCENDO
     of mayhem.  They've got the axes out, and in time with the
     MUSIC they reduce their pianos to matchsticks.  At the
     completion of the piece, they step to the front of the stage
     and with great decorum, arms around each other, they take
     their bows.  The curtain comes down to GREAT APPLAUSE.  We
     HEAR SFX of CRASHING AND BASHING backstage.  Now from behind
     Valiant, we HEAR a familiar high-pitched VOICE.

                               CIGARETTE GIRL
               Cigars... cigarettes... Eddie?

     Valiant turns to see BETTY BOOP standing with a box of
     tobacco wares strapped around her neck.  In contrast to all
     the other Toons, Betty's in black and white.

                               BETTY BOOP
                      (continuing)
               Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We
               miss you in Toontown.

                               VALIANT
               Wish I could say the same.  What're you
               doin' here, Betty?

                               BETTY BOOP
               Work's been slow for me since the
               cartoons went to color.  But I still
               got it, Eddie...
                      (sings)
               'Boop boop be-doop'.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, you still got it, Betty.
                      (indicates
                       Geezer)
               Who's Mr. Jocularity?

                               BETTY BOOP
                      (leans in)
               That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.

                               VALIANT
               Shoulda guessed.

                               BETTY BOOP
               He comes here every night to see
               Jessica Rabbit.

                               VALIANT
               Big on the musical comedy, huh?

                               BETTY BOOP
               Sounds like you ve never seen her,
               Eddie.

     Now the lights dim and Betty moves on.


     ON STAGE

     the dour DROOPY walks out with the spotlight following him.
     He's the evening's emcee.

                               DROOPY
                      (deadpan)
               Hello, everybody.  I hope you're all
               having as much fun as I am.  I have a
               small announcement to make.  Jessica
               Rabbit will not be able to sing
               tonight.

     There's a ROAR OF DISAPPROVAL from the men in the crowd.
     They shower him with debris.

                               DROOPY
                      (continuing;
                       deadpan)
               I was merely jesting.  Without further
               ado... here's woman times two,
               Toontown's own chanteuse par
               excellance... Jessica Rabbit!

     There is excited APPLAUSE as the lights dim. A TOON COMBO
     made up of CROWS in shades STRIKES UP the intro to the smokey
     song, "Why Don't You Do Right".  A spotlight hits the
     curtain. Now a curvaceous leg pokes out, teasingly.  The
     crowd goes wild as the rest of the body belonging to the leg
     emerges.  JESSICA RABBIT is a generously endowed red-headed
     bombshell.  She's a humanoid Toon... in her case, more
     beautiful than human.  Her figure is testimony to what a guy
     can do with a pencil and a fertile imagination,


     REACTION - VALIANT

     This is not quite the bunny he expected Roger to be married
     to.  His jaw drops.  And his reaction is mirrored all around
     the room.  The men are panting so hard you couldn't keep a
     match lit.


     CLOSEUP - JESSICA

     as she steps to the mike.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (sings)
               'You had plenty of money back
                  in '22
               You let other woman make a fool
                  of you
               Why don't you do right.
               Like some other men do...
               Get out of here and
               Get me the money too...'

     Jessica takes the mike and comes off the stage.  Slinkily.
     she wanders among the tables, teasing the men as she goes.

     Now there's a HOWL from behind Valiant.  A Tex Avery type
     TOON WOLF, who came masquerading as a human, couldn't help
     but show his true colors at the sight of Jessica.  He HOWLS
     as if it were a full moon.  His tongue rolls out of his head
     and piles up on the floor like so much clothesline.  His
     eyeballs telescope out of his head.  And finally, the Wolf
     levitates and snaps rigid like an open jacknife.  As the Wolf
     makes a rush for the stage, the Gorilla Bouncer grabs him by
     the suspenders.  The Wolf, legs spinning madly, practically
     knocks Valiant's table over as he grabs at Jessica.  But the
     Wolf has come to the end of his suspenders.  He snaps back
     toward the Gorilla who is holding an anvil in front of the
     suspenders.  CLANG!  The Wolf hits the anvil and slides to
     the floor.  The Gorilla calmly whisks him into a dustpan and
     carries him out.


     JESSICA

     like all good saloon singers, has continued her act
     undaunted.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (singing)
               'Why don't you do right.
               Like some other men do...'

     She sashays over to the Geezer's table.  Teasingly, she
     swirls the whisps of white hair onto his head into a Dairy
     Queen.  He giggles gleefully and makes a grab at Jessica.
     But she slips out of his grasp like mercury.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               'You ain't got no money
               Ain't got no use for you...'

     Now Jessica works her way over to Eddie.  She stops at his
     table and sings tauntingly.  Then with a flourish, she throws
     herself in his lap, and belts out the finale.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               'So get out of here...
               And get me the money toooo!'

     There is RAUCOUS APPLAUSE when she finishes.  Jessica looks
     deep into Eddie's eyes.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               Thanks for your lap.

     Before Eddie can reply, she jumps off, and slinks offstage,
     leaving Eddie a pile of human wreckage.  Valiant slugs the
     rest of his drink down to put out the fire in his libido.

     When the lights come up, Valiant looks over to where Acme is
     slicking down his eyebrows and patting his hair down.  He
     stands, picks up a bouquet of roses from the chair beside
     him, and as he passes Valiant's table, gives him a big wink.
     Valiant watches Acme disappear backstage.  He stands, drops
     a couple bucks on the table, and follows after him.


     BACKSTAGE

     Valiant steps past the curtain, keeping a discreet distance.
     He follows Marvin Acme down a corridor and around the corner.
     Acme stops and knocks on a dressing room door.  After a
     moment, it opens and Acme goes inside.  Valiant checks over
     his shoulder, but the backstage area is empty.  He eases over
     to the door and puts his eye to the keyhole.


     POV THROUGH KEYHOLE

     Jessica is seated at her dressing table.  Acme is on his
     knees next to her, kissing his way up her gloved hand, eyes
     closed in ecstasy.  Jessica takes her hand out of the glove
     and starts combing her hair, leaving Marvin kissing a
     suspended Toon glove.


     ANGLE ON VALIANT

     while he continues his peeping.  The Gorilla bouncer sneaks
     up behind him.

                               GORILLA
               Hey, whaddaya think you're doin',
               chump?

                               VALIANT
               Who're you callin' chump, chimp?

     The Gorilla smiles sadistically when he recognizes Valiant.

                               GORILLA
               Oh, it's da comedian...

     The Gorilla grabs Valiant by the belt and lifts him off the
     ground.  He opens the fire door and heaves Valiant out.


     EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

     Valiant comes flying out the door and CRASHES into a bunch of
     garbage cans in the alley.  The Gorilla stands in the doorvay
     regarding the dazed Valiant.

                               GORILLA
               And don't lemme catch your peepin' face
               around here again.  Got it?

                               VALIANT
               Ooga-booga.

     The Gorilla slams the door.  Valiant picks himself up out of
     the garbage.  He brushes himself off, then starts down the
     alley toward the rear of the building.  We FOLLOW him around
     the corner where he stops under Jessica's dressing room
     window.  He drags over a milk crate to stand on, takes a
     small camera out of his pocket and opens the bellows.  He
     stands on the crate and aims the camera through the corner of
     the window, as we HEAR the MUFFLED CONVERSATION from within.

                               ACME (O.S.)
               Are we going to play pattycake tonight?

                               JESSICA RABBIT (0.5.)
               Marvin, I have a headache...

                               ACME (O.S.)
                      (hurt)
               But you promised...

                               JESSICA RABBIT (O.S.)
               Oh, all right.  But this time take that
               hand buzzer off...

     Valiant's eyes widen in disgust.

                               VALIANT
               Jesus Christ...

     As he starts CLICKING pictures...

                                              CUT TO:


     EXT. MAROON STUDIO - LATE NIGHT

     There's one light on in the Administration building.


     INT. MAROON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     It's a large art deco office with walls covered with photos
     of Maroon and various celebrities, human and Toon.  R.K.
     Maroon is seated behind his desk.  Standing nearby is
     Valiant.  They are both regarding a hysterical Roger Rabbit,
     who's holding a set of 8 x lO glossies.  He's WAILING and
     CRYING, Toon tears flooding off him in a torrent.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Pattycake!  Pattycake!

                               VALIANT
               Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a
               good pair of shoes over it.

     ANGLE ON RUG

     Roger's tears have formed a puddle around the desk.  Valiant
     lifts a well-worn oxford and shakes the water off it.


     MAROON

     hands Roger his handkerchief.  Roger AAH-OO-GA'S his nose.

                               MAROON
               Take comfort, son, you're not the first
               man whose wife played pattycake on him.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I don't believe it.  I won't believe
               it.

                               MAROON
               The pictures don't lie.  Mr. Valiant
               here took them himself.

     Roger takes another look at the pictures.


     CLOSE - PHOTOS

     They're shots of Jessica Rabbit and Marvin Acme seated knee
     to knee, caught in the act of slapping palms... really
     playing pattycake.


     BACK TO SCENE

     Maroon gets up and crosses to a bar table set up by the
     window.  He pours a drink from a crystal decanter as Roger
     starts sobbing again.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               But Jessy... she's the light of my
               life, the apple of my eye, the cream in
               my coffee...

     Valiant eyes the booze longingly as he mutters to himself.

                               VALIANT
               Well, you better start thinkin' about
               drinkin' it black.

                               MAROON
               Frankly, I'm shocked.  Marvin Acme's
               been my friend and neighbor for thirty
               years.

     Maroon gestures out the window.  We see a blinking neon sign
     on the roof of the building across the street -- "Acme - If
     It's Acme - It's A Gasser!"

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               Who would have thought he was the Sugar
               Daddy?

     Maroon turns and carries the drink to Roger.  Meanwhile,
     Valiant sidles over to the bar to help himself.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               Well, the important thing now Roger, is
               to put all this behind you.
                      (hands him
                       drink)
               Drink this, son, you'll feel better.

     Roger takes the glass and shoots it down in one gulp.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               I know this all seems painful now, but
               you'll find someone new.  Won't he, Mr,
               Valiant?

     Eddie has just picked up the decanter to pour one for
     himself.

                               VALIANT
                      (over shoulder)
               Oh, yeah.  Good lookin' guy like him.
               Dames'll be breakin' his door down.


     CLOSE - ROGER

     The booze is taking its effect.  There's a RUMBLE like a
     volcano about to erupt.  Suddenly Roger's head turns into a
     Toon steam whistle SHRIEKING.  The HIGH PITCH causes glass
     objects in the room to SHATTER... including the crystal
     decanter that Valiant's holding in his hand.  It EXPLODES,
     soaking his suit with booze.  Valiant looks down at the
     damage, completely exasperated.

                               VALIANT
               Son-of-a-bitch...
                      (turns)
               Mr. Maroon, I think I'll be goin' now,
               so about the rest of my fee...

                               MAROON
               Sure, Valiant, sure...

     Maroon sits at the desk and writes a check.

                               MAROON
               Being experienced in these matrimonial
               matters, you have any advice for our
               friend here?

     Valiant crosses to the desk and takes the check.

                               VALIANT
               My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get
               yourself a quickie divorce.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Divorce?  Never!

     Suddenly Roger jumps onto Maroon's desk and grabs Valiant by
     the lapels.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Marriage is a two-way street and we're
               just experiencing a detour!  Jessica
               and I are going to get back together.
               We're going to be happy!   H-A-P-P-I!

     Roger zips off the desk and CRASHES out the window, leaving a
     rabbit outline in the glass... backlit by the blinking Acme
     sign.  Maroon and Valiant walk to the window and look out the
     rabbit-shaped hole in the window.

                               VALIANT
               At least he took it well.


     INT. VALIANT'S BUNGALOW - CLOSE - EMPTY BOOZE BOTTLE - EARLY
     MORNING

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL the bottle's on the floor next to the
     couch Valiant's passed out on.  He's still dressed in his
     clothes.  PAN the small studio apartment.  In the
     kitchen/alcove, Valiant has created a makeshift darkroom.  We
     see a curtain on a clothesline.  Various trays, and some
     pictures clipped up on clothespins.  The pictures depict
     Jessica Rabbit and Marvin Acme in various states of
     pattycake.  Now there is LOUD POUNDING on the door.  But it
     doesn't break through VaLiant's subconscious for several
     seconds.  Finally, he rouses, gets up and walks a crooked
     line to the door.  Valiant opens it and squints into the
     excruciating sunlight.  When his eyes focus, REVEAL a
     hang-dog POLICE DETECTIVE holding Eddie's morning paper.

                               VALIANT
               Lieutenant Santino... how ya doin'?

     Santino ignores the question and regards Valiant with a
     mixture of disgust and pity.

                               LT. SANTINO
               Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for
               a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.

                               VALIANT
               That's what you woke me up for?

     Santino flops open the morning paper.  Valiant's eyes narrow
     as he reads it.  The headline screams:  "TOON KILLS MAN!" And
     underneath:  "Marvin Acme Murdered at the Hands of Jealous
     Rabbit".  Santino throws the paper on the sofa.

                               LT. SANTINO
               You got trouble, Eddie.

     EXT. ACME FACTORY - DAY

     An L.A. police car turns into the yard of the Acme factory
     and pulls up in front of the old factory building.  There's
     all kinds of official activity in the yard... cop cars, a
     Coroner's truck, etcetera.

     Valiant and Santino get out of the police car.  Santino
     starts into the factory.  But he realizes Valiant's not
     following him.  He turns to see Valiant looking over the wall
     behind the factory, transfixed.

                               LT. SANTINO
               Now what?

                               VALIANT
               Just haven't been this close to
               Toontown for awhile.


     VALIANT'S POV

     The sky above the wall is a different color, a little bit
     more vibrant, a "Toon Blue", you might call it.


     SANTINO

     walks back and takes Valiant's arm.

                               LT. SANTINO
               Let's go, somebody wants to see you.

     Santino leads Valiant into the factory.


     INT. FACTORY - DAY

     It's a large warehouse filled with stacks of Toon gags,..
     boxes of dynamite, giant slingshots, boulders, everything
     you've ever seen in a Roadrunner cartoon.  Santino stops
     where a large black safe is imbedded at a cockeyed angle in
     the floor.  A FORENSIC TEAM is at work around the safe.
     They're chalking the outline around a body half obscured by
     the safe.

                               LT. SANTINO
               They say the rabbit got the safe idea
               from a cartoon he was makin' the other
               day.

                               VALIANT
               What a gasser.

                               LT. SANTINO
               Wait here...

     Santino walks to Acme's glassed office where a sobbing
     Jessica Rabbit is being interrogated.  We can only see her,
     not the person doing the interrogating.  Valiant sidles over
     to where the Forensic Guys are dusting the photographs he had
     taken for prints.  One of the Forensic Guys looks up from his
     work.

                               FORENSIC #1
               Say, didn't you used to be Eddie
               Valiant?

     Valiant ignores the slings and arrows and surveys the scene
     of the crime.  The door of the safe is ajar.  Valiant tries
     to look inside.  Forensic #2 closes the door with his knee.

     Now we HEAR the VOICE of Jessica Rabbit from behind them.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Mr. Valiant?

     Valiant turns to the voice.  WHAP!  Jessica slaps him hard
     enough across the face to make his head turn.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               I hope you're proud of yourself.

     She turns on her heel and storms off, sobbing into a
     handkerchief.  Valiant, rubbing his jaw, looks after her.  So
     do the Forensic Guys.

                               FORENSIC #1
               She likes you, Valiant.

                               FORENSIC #2
                      (low wolf
                       whistle)
               When they drew her, they broke the
               pencil.

     Now two WHITE-JACKETS from the Coroner's office start to
     carry Acme out on a stretcher.  As they pass Valiant, a hand
     still wearing a Hand Buzzer flops out.  Valiant grabs it --
     stopping the stretcher.

                               VALIANT
               Makes you wonder what in the world she
               was doin' with a guy who didn't clean
               his fingernails.


     CLOSE - HAND

     Imbedded under the fingernails is a reddish-brown substance.

                               FORENSIC #1
               So... it's blood.


     VALIANT

     peels a piece of it off... it chips and falls to the ground.
     He squats to examine it.

                               VALIANT
               It's not blood, it's paint.

     Suddenly the end of a cane comes down on Valiant's hand,
     pinning it to the floor.  Valiant follows the cane UP to it's
     gavel-shaped head -- past black pants, a black robe, to a
     cadaver-like complected face, and a large hooked proboscis.
     The head is shaved.  Rimless tinted glasses obscure the eyes.
     Although he's human, the total appearance is frighteningly
     vulture-like.  JUDGE DOOM is accompanied by Santino.

                               DOOM
               Is this man removing evidence from the
               scene of a crime?

                               LT. SANTINO
                      (deferential)
               Uh... no, Judge Doom.  Valiant here was
               just about to hand it over, weren't
               you, Valiant?

                               DOOM
               I'll take that.

     Doom takes his cane off Eddie's hand and reaches out for the
     paint chip.  Valiant palms a piece and drops a smaller piece
     into Doom's hand.  Doom examines it.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Looks like the deceased grabbed a
               handful of your client's pantaloons,
               Mr. Valiant.

     Valiant stands to face the Judge, who towers over him.

                               VALIANT
               He's not my client.  I was workin' for
               R.K. Maroon.

                               DOOM
               Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told
               us the rabbit became quite agitated
               when you showed him the pictures, and
               said nothing would stand in the way of
               him getting his wife back.  Is that
               true?

                               VALIANT
               Hey, pal, do I look like a
               stenographer?

                               LT. SANTINO
               Watch your mouth, Eddie, he's a judge.

     Doom smiles thinly at Valiant, tarns and walks with purpose
     towards the door.  Santino and Valiant follow.

                               DOOM
               The rabbit's movements are fairly clear
               after leaving the Maroon Studios.  He
               ran across the street, jimmied this
               door open, hoisted the safe on a block
               and tackle...


     EXT. ACME FACTORY

     Doom leads them outside and indicates a window.

                               DOOM
               ... then stood out here waiting for his
               prey.  After he cold-bloodedly
               accomplished his task, he went home.
               He was almost apprehended there by my
               men.

     Doom nods his head toward a group of sinister WEASLES (a la
     Disney's "Wind In The Willows").  They're loitering by a
     dogcatcher's wagon with "Toontown Control" on the side,
     cleaning their fingernails with switchblades and polishing
     Toon revolvers.
         
                               VALIANT
               Men?  They look more like weasles to
               me.

                               DOOM
               Yes, I find that weasles have a special
               gift for the work.
                      (turns back to
                       Valiant)
               The rabbit didn't contact you by any
               chance, did he?

                               VALIANT
               Why would he contact me?  I just took
               some lousy pictures.

                               DOOM
               So you wouldn't have any idea where he
               might be?

                               VALIANT
               Have you tried Walla Walla?  Kokomo's
               very nice this time of year.

     Doom steps into Valiant's face.

                               DOOM
               I'm surprised you aren't more
               cooperative, Mr. Valiant.  A human has
               been murdered by a Toon.  Don't you
               appreciate the magnitude of that?  My
               goal as Judge of Toontown, has been to
               rein in the insanity.  To bring a
               semblance of law and order to a place
               where no civilized person has ever been
               able to step foot.
               The only way to do that is to make the
               Toons respect the law.

     Suddenly a "YA-HA-HOOEY" interrupts his pontification, as a
     scruffy little TOON GOPHER comes hurtling over the wall from
     the Toontown side.  He's holding his blackened rear end...
     apparently the result of a run-in with a stick of dynamite.
     BONK!  The Gopher hits Doom in the back of the head, sending
     them both sprawling.  The Gopher picks himself up and shakes
     off the effects of the concusion.  When he sees who he's
     knocked down, he panics.

                               GOPHER
                      (petrified)
               Judge Doom!  Here, let me get that for
               ya.

     He whips a clothes brush out of his back pocket and furiously
     tries to clean the Judge's cloak.  Doom picks up the Gopher
     by the scruff of the neck and gets to his feet.

                               DOOM
               Why, you filthy little vagrant, you've
               soiled my robe!

                               GOPHER
               It's cleanin' up real good. Judge.

                               DOOM
               You've defiled a symbol of justice.

     As Doom carries the Gopher to the "Toontown Control" wagon,
     Valiant shoots a look to Santino.

                               VALIANT
                      (aside)
               Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?

                               LT. SANTINO
               No one knows.  He bought the election
               a few years back.  He's been rulin'
               Toontown ever since.

     When Doom gets to the wagon, the Weasles open up the back.
     In place of steel bars is a stream of fluid.  A Weasle turns
     a key and the flow of liquid stops.  The Gopher starts
     kicking furiously, trying to avoid the lock-up.

                                       GOPHER
                Oh, no, Judge, please, please, lemme
                go.  I think I hear my mother callin'
                me.

     Finally, the Gopher breaks free and makes a desperate dash
     for the wall.  Doom watches him run and calmly turns to where
     his car is parked.  It's a black Lincoln touring car with an
     ugly bird-like hood ornament.

                               DOOM
               Voltaire... the Gopher!

     Suddenly. the hood ornament SQUAWKS to life.  It's a hideous
     TOON VULTURE.  The Vulture flaps into flight.

     Just as the Gopher is about to make it over the top of the
     wall the Vulture's talons sink into his rear end and lift him
     airborne.  The Vulture drops the Gopher off with the Weasles.
     They pin him down.

                               GOPHER
               Hey, don't I have any rights?

                               DOOM
               Yes, you do... to a swift and speedy
               trial.

     One of the Weasles retrieves a briefcase from the sedan, puts
     it on the hood and snaps it open.  Twelve TOON KANGAROOS pop
     up, arranged in a jury box.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Court is now in session.

     He raps the Gopher on the head with the gavel end of his
     cane.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               The defendant is charged with vagrancy,
               assault and resisting arrest.  How do
               you find him?

     The Kangaroo court delivers the verdict instantly. Twelve
     LITTLE KANGAROOS pop up out of their Momma's pouches, holding
     up small cards, each with a letter spelling Y-O-U A-R-E
     G-U-I-L-T-Y.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Guilty as charged.  Case closed!

     Doom slams the briefcase shut.  He turns his attention back
     to the Gopher.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               I hereby sentence you to the dip!

                               GOPHER
               Oh no, not the dip!  Anything but the
               dip!  I'm too young to die...

     As the Judge pulls on a black rubber glove, the Weasles take
     out a stainless steel tub WHEEZING with sadistic glee.  They
     fill it from a spigot on the truck.

                               VALIANT
               What's with the dip?

                               LT. SANTINO
               That's how he gets rid of the
               troublemakers.  It's a combination of
               acetone, turpentine and paint remover.
               He calls it the...  Final Solution.


     THE GOPHER

     is wriggling and SCREAMING bloody murder as Doom lifts him up
     and holds him over the tub.  Then, as he's lowered into the
     solution, he starts to disappear. His pathetic SCREAMS are
     snuffed MID-YELP.

                               GOPHER
               Help!  Help!  He...

     The Gopher's gone.  All that's left of him is a paint slick
     on the surface of the liquid.

                               VALIANT
               Jesus.

     Doom pulls off the black rubber gloves finger by finger and
     hands them to a Weasle.  He turns to Valiant.

                               DOOM
                They're not kid gloves, Mr. Valiant.
                but that's how we handle things in
                Toontown.  I would think you'd
                appreciate that.

     He gets into his car, he pauses and looks back at Valiant.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               After all, didn't a Toon kill your
               brother?


     INT. TERMINAL BAR - DAY

     Dolores is behind the bar cutting lemon peels and preparing
     for the day's bartending.  There's one early customer, a
     grey-haired TROLLEYMAN in his Red Car uniform.  His hat's on
     the stool next to him and he's already drunk.  The door
     opens.  It's Valiant.  He walks over to the bar, reaches for
     a bottle and a shot glass and helps himself.  Dolores picks
     up a copy of the morning paper.

                               DOLORES
               Hey, Eddie, looks like you really
               stepped in it this time.

                               VALIANT
               What are you complaining about?  Here's
               your fifty bucks.

     Valiant slides the check across the bar.

                               TROLLEYMAN
                      (mumbling to
                       himself)
               Thirty-five years and all I got to show
               for it is a ticket punch.

                               VALIANT
               What's with Earl?

                               DOLORES
               A new outfit bought the Red Car.  Some
               big company called Cloverleaf
               Industries.

                               VALIANT
               No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?

                               DOLORES
               Bastards put him on notice.

     Valiant picks up his glass. lifts it in toast to the
     Trolleyman.

                               VALIANT
               Here's to the pencil pushers.  May they
               all get lead poisoning.

     Now the Trolleyman unsteadily climbs up on his stool to get
     close to the Holy Grail... the Red Car route map over the
     bar.

                               TROLLEYMAN
                      (wistfully)
               The old Number Six Line... who'da
               thought they'd close that one down?

                               DOLORES
               Eddie, get him down from there.  He's
               gonna break his neck.

     Eddie grabs Earl around the legs and throws him over his
     shoulder like a sack of potatoes.  He carries him over to a
     booth and puts him down carefully, covering him with a
     tablecloth.

                               TROLLEYMAN
               Took you right to Toontown, it did.

                               VALIANT
               I know, I know... poor S.O.B.

     Valiant walks back to his drink at the bar.

                               DOLORES
               Do you think the rabbit did it?

                               VALIANT
               I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
               Make that a round.

     Valiant and Dolores look down the bar, but there's no one
     there.  Finally the familiar cowlick of Baby Herman rises to
     the top of the bar as he clambers up a barstool.

                               DOLORES
               We don't serve formula. Snookums.

                               BABY HERMAN
               You serve martinis, doncha?

                               DOLORES
               Yeah...

    Baby Herman slides his baby bottle down the bar to Dolores.

                               BABY HERMAN
               Make it dry.  Baby doesn't like to be
               wet.
                      (to Valiant)
               You're Valiant, right?  The name's Baby
               Herman.

                               VALIANT
               I know who you are.  Kinda out of your
               neighborhood, aren't you?

                               BABY HERMAN
               Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a
               friend of mine's bein' framed.

                               VALIANT
               You mean the rabbit?  They got him
               cold.

                               BABY HERMAN
               You don't believe that.  I mean. the
               guy's an idiot, a moron, a complete
               fool...  but he'd never kill anyone.
               I know the guy.

     Dolores brings Baby Herman his baby bottle cocktail.

                               BABY HERMAN
                      (continuing)
               Thanks, doll.

     When Dolores turns around, Baby Herman pats her on the
     bottom.

                               DOLORES
                      (over her
                       shoulder)
               Oh, a ladies man, huh?

                               BABY HERMAN
                      (sotto voce; to
                       Valiant)
               My problem is I got a fifty-year-old
               lust and a three-year-old dinkie.

                               VALIANT
               My problem is I come here to drink in
               peace.  So if you don't mind...

                               BABY HERMAN
               C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole
               thing smell a bit funny to you?  I
               mean, no offense, but how did a
               mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in
               the first place?

                               DOLORES
                      (chiming in)
               Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an
               ad in the Yellow Pages.

                               VALIANT
               Thanks for the vote of confidence.

                               BABY HERMAN
               And another thing, the paper said no
               will was found.  But every Toon knows
               Acme had a will and, in it he promised
               to leave Toontown to the Toons.

                               VALIANT
               So where is it then?

                               BABY HERMAN
               Somebody took it from him.  That's what
               this whole thing's about.

                               DOLORES
               The papers said the safe door was
               opened, Eddie.

                               VALIANT
               Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya,
               Dolores?

                               BABY HERMAN
               My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always
               was after Acme's property.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?

     Valiant takes the paint chip out of his pocket and dangles it
     in front of Baby Herman.

                               BABY HERMAN
               No.  But neither does Roger.  That's
               Diablo Red.  Roger's pants are Sunrise
               Orange.

                               DOLORES
               Well, I'll be...

                               BABY HERMAN
               So what's your next move, Valiant?

                               VALIANT
               My next move?  That's easy.  I'm
               gettin' up, and I'm walkin' out the
               door, and I'm goin' home to bed.

     Valiant stands.

                               DOLORES
               So you're not even gonna bother to find
               out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?

                               VALIANT
               He's a Toon... who cares?

     Baby Herman shakes his head sorrowfully.  As Valiant heads
     for the door, Dolores whaps her towel down on the bar.

                               DOLORES
               Well, you used to care, Eddie.  And it
               didn t matter if a client's skin was
               black, white, or painted!

     Valiant ignores her and walks out the door.


     INT. VALIANT'S HOUSE - DAY

     Eddie comes in the door with his coat over his shoulder.  He
     tosses the jacket over the chair and walks to the Murphy bed.
     He grabs the strap, and loosening his tie, walks away from
     the wall, pulling the bed down.  What he doesn't see is...


     ROGER RABBIT

     asleep in the bed.


     VALIANT

     still with his back to Roger, sits down exhaustedly on the
     bed and kicks off his shoes.  He lies back and pulls the
     covers over him.  He closes his eyes, rolls over to get
     comfortable.  Now he and Roger are nose-to-nose.  They both
     open their eyes at the same time.  They freak.

                               VALIANT
                      (screams)
               Aah!

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (screams)
               Aah!

     They both jump out of the bed.

                               VALIANT
               What the hell are you doin'?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I needed a place to hide.  I'm in
               trouble, Eddie.

                               VALIANT
               So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could
               get me a rap for aiding and abetting.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm
               here.

                               VALIANT
               Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my
               house?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well, I asked the newsboy on the
               corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked
               a janitor, the fireman and finally the
               green grocer down the way.  He was very
               helpful.

                               VALIANT
               In other words, the whole goddamn world
               knows you're here!  Out!  Get out!

     Eddie tries to open the door, but Roger blocks it
     spider-like, arms and legs extended.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Please, Eddie, don't put me out.  I
               didn't do it, I swear.

     Valiant gives up trying to open the door and grabs Roger.  He
     pulls and he pulls.  Finally Roger snaps off like a broken
     rubber band.  The two of them go tumbling backward.  Valiant
     makes a grab for Roger but he slips out of his grasp like
     quicksilver.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               Sure I wanted to win Jessy back, but
               not that way.

     Valiant lunges again.  Roger dodges.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               After I left you, I went to see her at
               the Ink & Paint Club.

     Valiant picks himself up and tries to catch his breath.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               She was on stage, so I found a piece of
               paper and wrote her a love letter.

     Roger pulls a piece of paper out of his pocket and starts
     reading.

                                ROGER RABBIT
                       (continuing)
               'Dear Jessy.  How do I love thee?  Let
               me count the ways.  1-1000, 2-1000,
               3-1000...

     Valiant leaps for Roger and gets bim by the throat.  He rips
     the paper out of Roger's hand and crumples it up and throws
     it down.  He opens the door, throws Roger outside and quickly
     slams the door shut.  He leans against it, breathing hard.
     Suddenly, Roger comes through the mail slot like a limbo
     dancer.  Valiant, too tired to chase him, just watches him.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               Hey, that wasn't very nice.

     He retrieves the love letter, straightens it and puts it back
     in his pocket.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               It took me almost an hour to compose
               that.  But I decided not to leave it
               anyway.  I'd read it in person, that
               was my plan.

     Valiant crosses to the kitchen area where the dark room is
     still set up.  He opens the cabinet under the sink and comes
     out with a bottle of Scotch.  He takes a shot glass and pours
     himself one.

                               VALIANT
               Look, pal, if you're still here when I
               finish this drink, I'm callin' the
               police.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya.
               The police'll just dip me.  They were
               waitin' for me when I got home last
               night.  I ran.

                               VALIANT
               If you're so innocent, why'd you run?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always
               run.

     Valiant shoots the drink down and holds up the empty glass.
         
                               VALIANT
               That's it.

     He crosses to the phone on the counter.  He lifts the
     receiver and starts to dial.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well, this is the moment of truth!  And
               I've spoken the truth, but you won't
               believe the truth.  So I guess the
               truth is my goose is cooked, my hash is
               slung. my fait is accompli.

     As Valiant finishes dialing, he idly puts the empty shot
     glass down on a photograph on the counter.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               Won't anything change your mind?

     Valiant turns from the pleading rabbit.  Now something he
     sees on the counter gets his attention.


     POV THROUGH SHOT GLASS

     The shot glass is resting on one of the reject pictures of
     Acme and Jessica.  The bottom of the glass is magnifying the
     back of the exuberant Marvin Acme.  Sticking out of his back
     pocket is a legal folder headed "Last Will and Testament".


     CLOSE - VALIANT

     He looks as if the truth has just hit him in the face.

                               VALIANT
               The goddamn will.

                               VOICE
                      (on phone)
               L.A.P.D.?

     Valiant slowly returns the phone to the cradle,

                               ROGER RABBIT
               You mean you believe me?

     Now outside we HEAR TIRES SCREECHING to a stop.  Roger runs
     to the window and pulls back the drapes.  His eyes bug out of
     his head.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               It's Toon Control!

     Valiant comes to the window and looks out, too.


     VALIANT'S POV

     The Toon Control wagon has stopped in front of the house.
     The Weasles pile out.  One of them takes what looks like a
     butterfly net out of the back.  Several others grab violin
     cases.


     EDDIE AND ROGER

     Valiant jerks Roger back behind the curtain.

                               VALIANT
               Get away from that window.

     Roger, elated, jumps into Valiant's arms.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               You're gonna help me?  How can I ever
               thank you?

     He plants a big wet Toon kiss on Valiant's lips.

                               VALIANT
               For starters... don't ever kiss me.


     EXT. BUNGALOW

     The Weasles are filing up the walk to the front door.  The
     leader pounds on the front door.

                               WEASLE
               Police...


     INT. BUNGALOW

     Valiant puts Roger down.

                               VALIANT
               I'll talk to 'em.  Find a place to
               hide.

     Roger zips to the closet door and goes inside.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Not in there.  That's the first place
               they'll look.

     Valiant goes to the closet and opens the door.  REVEAL Roger
     is now dressed in Eddie's trenchcoat and hat.  Playfully,
     Roger snaps one of the handcuffs onto Eddie's wrist.  He's
     got the Other attached to one of his wrists.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest!
               Just kidding...

                               VALIANT
               You idiot.  I lost the key for those
               cuffs.

     BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!  The KNOCKING is more impatient.  Valiant
     looks to the door.

                               WEASLE (O.S.)
               Open up!


     EXT. VALIANT'S DOOR

     The Weasles open the violin cases and take out real tommy guns
     and shoulder them in teams of two.  Suddenly they unleash a
     torrent of MACHINE GUN FIRE, making the outline of a weasle
     in the door with BULLETS.  The leader blows on the cut-out
     and it falls in.  The Weasles file through one by one.


     INT. APARTMENT

     The Weasles don't bother to look around.  They all just start
     BLASTING.  Bullets fly every which way.  The barrage destroys
     Valiant's apartment in a matter of seconds.  When the
     shooting stops and the smoke clears, the Weasles look around.
     The head Weasle spots blood all over the kitchen floor.

                                WEASLE #1
               We got him.

     But when he looks behind the counter, it's only a shattered
     ketchup bottle.


     EXT. REAR OF APARTMENT

     Eddie and Roger, handcuffed together, are beating it down the
     alley.  Roger, being a rabbit, is beating it a lot faster.
     He's kicking up dust, his legs are blur.  Valiant stumbles
     trying to keep up.  When they round the corner, Roger slams
     on the brakes, Toon style.  Valiant goes skidding past him and
     is jerked to a stop like a dog on a short leash.

                               VALIANT
               Hey!  What do you think you're doin'?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a
               Toon.

                               VALIANT
               Don't ever forget that.


     EXT. BUNGALOW - BACK WINDOW - THE WEASLES

     come piling out the window.  They start sniffing the ground.
     Suddenly one of them freezes on point, like a dog.  Another
     blows a HUNTER'S HORN and they're off on the trail.


     EXT. STREET - EDDIE AND ROGER

     emerge from the alley.  They pause momentarily to
     reconnoiter.  Eddie decides to go left, Roger right.  When
     they get to the end of the cuffs, they snap back into a pile.
     Valiant gets back to his feet and hauls Roger up angrily.

                               VALIANT
               This way, goof...

     They start across the street.  But Roger goes on one side of
     the Street sign, Eddie the other.  Roger coils around it like
     a tether ball.  Valiant yanks Roger off the sign and they
     duck across the street just as a trolley car passes.


     THE WEASLES

     come bloodhounding around the corner.  They search the street
     for signs of the fugitive.  But when they get to the trolley
     tracks, they stop, bewildered.

                               WEASLE #1
               Scent's cold.

                               WEASLE #2
               Pssst.

     He points toward the trolley car pulling into the Terminal
     Station.  They fall all over themselves scurrying over to the
     trolley.  They surround it and jump aboard, tommy-gun at the
     ready.


     INT. RED CAR

     The CONDUCTOR raises his hands like it was a hold-up.  A
     couple PASSENGERS scream as the Weasles search the car.  But
     no Roger or Eddie.  As quickly as they got on, they get off.


     EXT. RED CAR

     as it pulls away.  The Weasles look around perplexed.

                               WEASLE #1
               Funny... I could swear I smelled
               rabbit.


     ANGLE FROM ABOVE

     Eddie and Roger are balanced on the trolley wire above the
     Weasles' heads.  As the Weasles sniff around the barn, Eddie
     and Roger ease along the wire, using the wall of the Terminal
     Bar to lean on.


     INT. TERMINAL BAR - KITCHEN

     Dolores is preparing corned beef and cabbage.  The RADIO is
     PLAYING "MARES EAT OATS".  A NEWSCASTER breaks into the
     music.

                               NEWSCASTER
               News flash... Hollywood.  Citywide
               Toonhunt for Roger Rabbit, suspect in
               Acme slaying.  Police describe him as
               short, cuddly...  and psychotic.

     Dolores turns just as Roger's grinning face appears in the
     window.

                               DOLORES
                      (startled)
               Mother Mary...

     Now Eddie's face comes into view.  He motions for her to open
     the window.


     OUTSIDE THE WINDOW

     Roger and Eddie watch another trolley approach.  The contact
     arm sparks its way along the wire as it rolls along towards
     them.  Valiant watches as Dolores struggles to get the window
     open.

                               VALIANT
               Hurry, hurry...

     At the last second, the window opens.  Eddie jumps for the
     sill, Roger dangling from the cuffs as the trolley passes.


     INT. KITCHEN

     Dolores helps pull Valiant through the window.  Then he drags
     Roger inside.

                               DOLORES
               Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it
               is?

                               VALIANT
               Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.

     Roger bows at the waist, takes her hand and kisses it like
     Charles Boyer

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Charmed, enchanted, pleasure's all
               mined.

                               DOLORES
               Where'd you find him?

                               VALIANT
               The Toon Fairy left him under my
               pillow.

     Now Roger spots a plate of freshly shucked corn.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               May I?

     Before she can answer, he grabs an ear, presses it to his
     lips and applies the typewriter method to it.  When he gets
     to the end of a row, we even HEAR the BING!

                               DOLORES
               He's a riot.

                               VALIANT
               Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed
               to him.
                      (holds up
                       cuffs)
               Anybody in the back room?

                               DOLORES
               It's all yours.

     We FOLLOW Dolores as she leads Valiant and Roger across the
     hall.  She stops at a door, unlocks it, and leads them in.


     INT. BACK ROOM

     It's a tiny storage room/office with an institutional metal
     desk, a cot, and assorted janitorial supplies stacked around.
     Dolores shuts and locks the door behind her.  Valiant goes to
     a metal locker and digs through some tools, coming out with a
     hacksaw.  He sits on the cot and starts working on the cuffs.

                               DOLORES
               So you decided to help him after all?

                               VALIANT
               I oughta have my head examined.
                      (to Roger)
               Will you hold still?

     Roger quiets like a child for a moment as Valiant saws
     feverishly.  Then Roger slips his hand out of the cuff and
     holds his side while Eddie keeps sawing.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Does this help?

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, that's better.

     Valiant saws a couple more strokes before the realization of
     what Roger's done hits him.  His face darkens.  Roger sees
     the look and sheepishly tries to recover by sticking his hand
     back in the cuff.

                               VALIANT
               You mean to tell me you coulda taken
               your hand outta that cuff at any time?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well, no, not any time.  Only when it
               was funny.

     Valiant looks at Roger like he's about to brain him.  Roger
     pulls his hand free again, and cowers out of range.  Valiant
     just rubs his forehead.

                               VALIANT
               Are you always this funny, or only on
               days when you're wanted for murder?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               My philosophy is if you don't have a
               sense of humor, you're better off dead.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah... well you just might get your
               wish.

                               DOLORES
               Can you get him out of it, Eddie?

                               VALIANT
               If I can find whoever wanted to kill
               Acme bad enough to get this.

     Valiant throws the pattycake picture down on the table.
     Dolores and Roger both examine it closely.

                               DOLORES
               Acme's will.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               So that's what this little drama is all
               about.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah.  I think Maroon plays the part of
               the sound mind, your wife the sound
               body.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I resent that innuendo!  My wife is
               completely innocent.

                               VALIANT
               Your wife may be a lot of things, pal,
               but innocent isn't one of them.

                               DOLORES
               So what's the scam, Eddie?

                               VALIANT
               Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody
               wants Acme's property.  Cack the old
               man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the
               will.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               The habeus corpus is thickening.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't
               think they got the will.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               How do you know that?

                               VALIANT
               Well, Acme had the will in his pocket
               that night at the club.  It was gone in
               the morning when the cops found the
               body.

                               DOLORES
               Maybe they just took it out of his
               pocket.

                               VALIANT
               Then why'd they bother to crack the
               safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from
               Mount Baldy and it won't open.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your
               logic is specious.  What prevented Mr.
               Acme from putting the will back in the
               safe before they killed him?

                               VALIANT
               Because he's not forty feet tall.  The
               safe was up on the ceiling, remember?

     Dolores whistles over his deductions.

                               DOLORES
               Eddie, you still got it.  Hey, tomorrow
               maybe I'll go down to probate court and
               see who's sniffin' around Acme's
               estate?

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, do that.  I'm gonna go rattle
               Maroon's cage.

     Valiant finishes sawing the cuffs.  He stands and throws the
     cuffs aside.  Valiant and Dolores go to the door.  Roger
     follows them eagerly.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               What should I do?  Who should I see?
               Where should I go?

     Valiant turns.

                               VALIANT
               Nothin', no one, nowhere,

     He slams the door.


     INT. POLO LOUNGE - CLOSE - MAROON

     He's in a booth in the middle of a business lunch.

                               MAROON
               Maybe money grows on trees in Toontown,
               but not at the Maroon Studio.

     WIDEN THE SHOT to REVEAL that Maroon's sharing a booth with
     BUGS BUNNY and his AGENT.  Bugs is chewing on a carrot.

                               BUGS BUNNY
               Look, Doc, fiduciary considerations
               aside, Roger Rabbit may have been
               willing to play second banana to an
               ankle-biter, but I ain't.


     ACROSS THE ROOM

     A MAITRE D' is leading Valiant and Augie, the deaf-mute to a
     table by the door.

                               VALIANT
               This'll be fine, huh, Augie?

      Augie nods his head.  They sit and pick up the menus.  Augie
      takes one peek and looks at Valiant, alarmed.  He scribbles a
      note.  Valiant reads it.

                               VALIANT
               Forget about the prices, pal.  If you
               want the shrimp cocktail, you have a
               shrimp cocktail.
                      (puts menu
                       down)
               Excuse me, Augie, I've got a little
               table-hopping to do.

      Valiant gets up from the table and starts across the room.


      AT MAROON'S BOOTH

                               AGENT
               I think you should know, R.K., we're in
               negotiations for Bugs to star in his
               own series at Warner Brothers.

                               MAROON
               Trying to scare up a bidding war
               between me and Jack Warner, eh?  Well,
               it won't work.  I'll call William
               Morris and I'll have 'em put out a
               rabbit call the likes of which this
               town's never seen!

                               BUGS BUNNY
               It's your dime, Doc.

                               MAROON
               And stop callin' me Doc!

                               BUGS BUNNY
               Eh, sure, Doc.

     Now Valiant arrives, pulls up a chair from next table and
     sits down.

                               VALIANT
               Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?

                               MAROON
               Valiant?  What're you doin' here?

                               VALIANT
               I Just thought I'd drop by and show you
               a photograph.

                               MAROON
               I've already seen your photographs.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, but I enlarged this one.  Thought
               you might be interested.

     Valiant takes an enlargement of the pattycake shot and puts
     it on the table in front of Maroon.  We can clearly see the
     will sticking out of Acme's pocket.

                               VALIANT
               Anyway... enjoy your lunch.

     Valiant stands and departs.  But his visit has done it's
     trick.  Maroon looks l'ike he's seen a ghost.  We FOLLOW
     Valiant across the room to his table where Augie is
     blissfully attacking a shrimp cocktail.

                               VALIANT
               How is that, Augie, pretty good?

     Augie nods enthusiastically.  Valiant keeps an eye on
     Maroon's booth.  Now he nudges Augie as Maroon excuses
     himself and goes into the phone booth just outside the door.
     Augie puts his shrimp fork down and picks up his pencil.


     AUGIE'S POV

     We see Maroon talk on the phone MOS.  As his lips move,
     Valiant supplies his words.

                               VALIANT (V.O.)
               It's me.  Valiant says there's a will.
               I don't know what he's trying to
               pull...


     BACK TO SCENE

     Valiant is reading of Augie's pad as Augie reads Maroon's
     lips, and scribbles down what he says.

                               VALIANT
                      (reading)
               Somebody's gonna have to take care of
               him.

     Augie looks up from his scribbling to exchange an eyebrow
     raising glance with Valiant.  Then he turns back to Maroon
     again.

                               VALIANT
                      (reading)
               The old man had it at the club that
               night.  That's right.  Yeah, I'm sure.
               I'll be there.

     Augie stops writing as Maroon hangs up the phone.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing; to
                       Augie)
               Where?

     Augie shrugs his shoulders.  Disappointed, Valiant lights a
     cigarette.  Now Augie elbows him and gestures across at
     Maroon, who's making another call.  Augie starts writing
     again.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing;
                       reading)
               Iris... cancel my appointments this
               afternoon.  I'll be at Forest Lawn.

     Maroon hangs up the phone and comes out of the phone booth.
     He hustles out of the room.  Valiant stands.

                               VALIANT
               You did great, Augie.  Have another
               shrimp cocktail.

     Valiant drops a twenty on the table and pats Augie on the
     back.


     EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL

     A CARHOP wheels a yellow Packard up in front.  Maroon climbs
     in and ROARS off.  Valiant ENTERS THE FRAME.  He looks after
     Maroon, then calmly starts walking down the driveway.


     EXT. FOREST LAWN CEMETERY - RED CAR STOP - DAY

     A Red Car pulls up.  Valiant climbs off.  He calmly crosses
     the street and ducks behind the cemetery entranceway as
     Maroon's Packard ROARS through.

                               VALIANT
                      (impressed)
               Love that Red Car.

     As Valiant starts to walk up the hill...

                                              CUT TO:


     THE ACME FUNERAL SITE - LONG SHOT - DAY

     A hearse, and a line of black limos are parked in the lane.
     Nearby, Marvin Acme's funeral is in progress.  Clustered
     around a gravesite are the mourners... TOONS of every stripe.
     There's MICKEY MOUSE comforting MINNIE.  TOM AND JERRY.
     HECKLE AND JECKLE.  CHIP 'N DALE.  Everyone from the famous
     to the not so famous is in attendance.  The eulogy is being
     delivered in a familiar blustery Southern VOICE.  It's
     FOGHORN LEGHORN.

                               FOGHORN LEGHORN
               Today we commit the body of brother
               Acme to the cold, I say cold, cold
               ground.  We shed no tears for we know
               that Marvin is going to a better place.
               That high, high, I say that
               high-larious place up in the sky.

     Foghorn Leghorn dramatically points skyward.

                               TOONS
                      (in unison)
               A-men!


     NEW ANGLE - VALIANT

     is leaning up against a palm tree on the hill.  We have been
     watching the proceedings from his POV.  Now he sees Maroon's
     car pull up.  He moves around to the other side of the tree
     as Maroon passes and starts wending his way through the
     crowd.


     AT THE GRAVESITE

     Foghorn Leghorn nods to the funeral DIRECTOR, a pasty-faced
     human in a black mourning coat.  The Director starts to turn
     the crank lowering the coffin into the grave.

                               FOGHORN LEGHORN
               Give us a sign, brother Herman, that
               you've arrived...

     Much to the funeral Director's amazement, the crank starts
     PLINKING Out the tune to "POP GOES THE WEASLE".  Now the Toon
     mourners pick up on it and join in.

                               TOONS
                      (singing)
               Round and round the mullberry bush, The
               monkey chased the weasle...

     The crank and SONG start going FASTER AND FASTER.

                               TOONS
                      (continuing;
                       singing)
               The monkey raid it all was in fun.  POP!
               Goes the weasle.

     Suddenly half of the lid to Acme's coffin flies open and a
     harlequin CLOWN BOI-YOI-YOINGS out.  The funeral Director
     faints dead away as the Toon SOBS turn to LAUGHTER.  The
     Toons turn and head away from the grave comforted by a
     funeral befitting a gag king.  They climb into their cars and
     SCREECH off like the start of the Indy 500.  One mourner is
     left at the gravesite.  Sitting in a chair dabbing at her
     eyes with a handkerchief is Jessica Rabbit.  Maroon walks up
     behind her.

                               MAROON
               So... trying to pull a fast one on me,
               huh?

     Jessica turns, startled.  She stands and faces Maroon.


     VALIANT

     smiles and leans in.  This is the moment he's been waiting
     for.  Now just as the conversation begins, it is drowned out
     by the NOISE from a LAWN MOWER.  Valiant turns to see a
     GARDENER riding around on a small tractor cutting the grass.
     Valiant tries to flag him down as he watches Maroon and
     Jessica having an arguement.  There's accusatory finger
     pointing.  In pantomime, Maroon gestures into his pocket as
     if describing the position of Acme's will.

     Jessica tries to leave.  He grabs her arm.  They're screaming
     at each other but we don't hear a word.  Valiant waves
     frantically for the Gardener to cut the machine.  But the
     Gardener misconstrues it as a friendly greeting and waves
     back.  Valiant turns in time to see Jessica kick Maroon in
     the groin and stomp off to a red Auburn Speedster.  She jumps
     in and speeds away as Maroon staggers back to his car.  The
     Gardener stops the tractor next to Valiant.  He SHUTS OFF THE
     ENGINE.  The cemetery is completely still again.

                               GARDENER
               Somethin' you want, mister?

                               VALIANT
               Not anymore...


     EXT. INK & PAINT CLUB - ALLEY - NIGHT

     A Steinway piano truck is parked next to the stage door.  TWO
     husky PIANO MOVERS are rolling a baby grand up the ramp to
     the stage door.  They knock on the door.  The Gorilla opens
     it and they muscle the piano inside.  After a moment, they
     reemerge.  We FOLLOW them back to the truck where a second
     baby grand stands ready to be moved.

                               MOVER #1
               I don't know about you, but it makes me
               sick to think of these beautiful pianos
               gettin' chopped into match sticks every
               night by those screwy ducks.

     Struggling, they push this second piano into the club.


     INT. CLUB - BACKSTAGE

     They roll the piano over to the wall and park it next to the
     first.

                               MOVER #2
                      (shakes head)
               And they call it entertainment.

     As they go out the stage door, MOVE IN on the baby grand.


     INSIDE THE PIANO - VALIANT

     is lying prone -- using the Steinway as his own Trojan Horse.
     He lifts the piano lid to climb out, but then HEARS FOOTSTEPS
     approaching.  He lowers the lid again.  Now someone starts
     testing the keys.  We see the hammers strike the strings,
     RUNNING UP THE SCALES until they reach the one under
     Valiant's nose.  The hammer whacks Valiant's nose on the
     backswing and strikes the string making a terrible SOUR NOTE.

                               DONALD DUCK (V.O.)
                      (exasperated
                       QUACK)
               Phooey!  Out of tune again!

                               DAFFY DUCK (V.O.)
               Not to worry, Donald.  We can fix that
               with my sledgehammer.

                               DONALD DUCK (V.O.)
               Never mind, Daffy.  I've got an axe in
               my dressing room.

     Valiant's eyes widen.


     ANGLE ON PIANO

     as the VOICES of Daffy and Donald recede, Valiant raises the
     lid and quickly climbs out.  He eases over to Jessica's
     dressing room.  As he starts to open the door, he HEARS
     SCUFFLING from inside.  Valiant puts his ear to the door.
     More SCUFFLING.  Valiant straightens, then suddenly whips the
     door open and flicks on the light.


     INT. DRESSING ROOM

     Nobody's there.  Perplexed, Valiant closes the door behind
     him and checks behind the dressing screen.  In the closet.
     No one.  He shrugs and starts to search the room.  He goes to
     Jessica's dressing table and rifles the drawers.  In her
     purse he discovers a Toon revolver.  He examines it.

                               VALIANT
               Girl's gotta protect herself.

     Valiant puts the gun back in the purse and closes the drawer.
     As he stands, he pauses to consider a Hurrel-like
     black-and-white photo of Roger Rabbit in a silver deco frame.
     He's dramatically posed with a cigarette like he was Tyrone
     Power.

     Valiant shakes his head and turns from the table.  Something
     catches his eye.


     ANGLE ON FLOOR

     Behind the dressing table, the corner of a piece of blue
     paper peeks out.  Valiant stoops down and fishes it out.
     It's a cover for a legal document -- "Last Will and Testament
     -- Marvin Acme".


     VALIANT

     stands, pleased.  He opens the blue folder.  But it's empty.
     Valiant puts it in his inside pocket and turns to go when
     suddenly an unseen hand flicks the lights off.

                               VALIANT
               Son of a bitch...

     We can't see anything in the darkness.  But we hear the SOUND
     of A FISTFIGHT.  There's the CRASHING of lamps and furniture
     breaking.  Now the door opens for a second as the assailant
     escapes.  Light floods in the room, illuminating Valiant on
     the floor with a curtain wrapped around his head.  As he
     struggles free the door closes.  The room is dark again.
     Valiant scrambles to the door.  When he whips it open, REVEAL
     the Gorilla framed in the doorway.  Valiant is frozen.  The
     Gorilla flicks on the light.  He smiles wickedly.

                               GORILLA
               And here I tought we had mice.

     Valiant tries to make a break for it.  WHAM!  The Gorilla
     lays him out cold with a right cross.

                                              BLACKOUT.


     FADE IN:

     VALIANT'S POV FROM FLOOR

     As his vision comes INTO FOCUS, Valiant sees the Gorilla,
     Jessica Rabbit, the Weasles and Judge Doom are standing over
     him.

                               GORILLA
               ... I caught him rummagin' around in
               here.  Then I called you, Judge, on a
               counta you be da one we pay juice to.

                               DOOM
                      (clears throat)
               You did the right thing, Bongo.


     THE WEASLES

     pull a groggy Valiant upright and plop him in a chair in
     front of Doom.

                               DOOM
               Being caught breaking and entering is
               not very good advertising for a
               detective.  What were you looking for,
               Mr. Valiant?

                               VALIANT
               Ask her...

     Valiant nods toward Jessica, who stands coolly smoking a
     cigarette.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Last week some heavy breather wanted
               one of my nylons as a souvenir.  Maybe
               that's what he was after?

                               VALIANT
               Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I
               woulda broken into Frederick's of
               Hollywood.  I was lookin' for Marvin
               Acme's will.

                               DOOM
               Marvin Acme had no will.  I should
               know, the probate is in my court.

                               VALIANT
               He had a will, all right.  She took it
               off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon
               knocked him off.  Then she set up her
               loving husband to take the fall.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               You, Mr. Valiant, are either drunk or
               punch drunk.  Probably both.

                               DOOM
               These are bold accusations, Mr.
               Valiant.  I hope you have some proof?

                               VALIANT
               I found the cover the will came in
               behind the dressing table.

     Valiant reaches into his pocket.  But the blue envelope is
     gone.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               They must've taken it off me.

                               DOOM
               They?

                               VALIANT
               The other people who were in here
               lookin' for the will.  I woulda caught
               'em if Cheetah here hadn't interrupted
               me.

     The Gorilla makes a move for Valiant.  Doom stops him.

                               DOOM
               Take it easy, Bongo.  We'll handle Mr.
               Valiant our own way... downtown.

                               VALIANT
               Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of
               Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk
               to him.

                               DOOM
               Oh, not that downtown.  Toontown.

     The mention of Toontown has a visible impact on Valiant.

                               VALIANT
                      (nervous)
               You're not takin' me to downtown
               Toontown?

                               DOOM
               Indeed we are.  We'll continue the
               interrogation there.

                               VALIANT
                      (very agitated)
               I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me
               Santino.

                               DOOM
               You're a very stubborn man, Mr.
               Valiant.  Very pig-headed.  Boys, show
               Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed
               men at the Toontown station...

     As the Weasles drag Valiant out of the room...

                               VALIANT
                      (screaming)
               No... you bastards!  Leggo of me!


     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     The Toon Control Wagon streaks along with the cat SIREN
     WAILING.  It flashes by then slams on the brakes at the
     entrance to an eerie tunnel.  A sign next to the tunnel says:
     "Toontown".


     INT. WAGON

     The Weasles look over at the bound and gagged Valiant.  One
     of them turns Valiant's head to look at the Toontown sign.

                               WEASLE #1
               What're you shakin' for?  Didn't you
               have a good time last time you were
               here?

     With a wicked WHEEZE, the driver floors it.


     EXT. TUNNEL

     The wagon disappears into the murky darkness.  PAN UP to the
     night sky.

                                              DISSOLVE TO:


     THE SKY - MORNING

     PAN DOWN to the tunnel.  We can't see into the darkness but
     we HEAR HOOTING and HOLLERING from within.  GUNS going off,
     FIRECRACKERS EXPLODING, WHIPS CRACKING, all accompanied by
     the WHEEZING LAUGHTER of the Weasles.

                               WEASLE #1 (O.S.)
               Soo-eey!  Soo-eey!

                               WEASLE #2 (O.S.)
               Let him go, boys.  I think he's got the
               message.

     After a beat, Valiant comes staggering out of the tunnel.
     He's got a burlap sack over his head tied around his waist.
     Behind him, the Weasles emerge holding paint cans and
     brushes.  They watch as he trips and falls by the side of the
     road.  The Weasles GIGGLE victoriously and head back inside.
     Valiant lies there for a moment, catching his breath.  Then
     he struggles to free his hands.  Finally he rips the sack off
     his head and sits up.


     CLOSE - VALIANT

     We see he's got a huge Toon pig with a goofy grin painted
     over his head.  Valiant pulls and tugs on it, but this is a
     costume that won't come off.  Valiant curses, gets to his
     feet and stumbles down the road.


     EXT. RED CAR STOP

     Valiant gets in the back of the line of PASSENGERS boarding
     the Red Car.


     INT. RED CAR - VALIANT

     steps aboard.  The Trolleyman, who we recognize as Earl from
     the Terminal bar, does a double-take when he sees the
     ridiculously silly looking man/Toon.

                               EARL
               Here's one for the books... a Toon
               wearin' human clothes.

                               VALIANT
               Earl... it's me, Valiant.

                               EARL
               Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?

                               VALIANT
               Toon cops worked me over.

                               EARL
               Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real
               Toon-a-Roo.

                               VALIANT
                      (apprehensively)
               What am I, Earl?

     Earl breaks the news to Valiant soberly.

                               EARL
               You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.

                               VALIANT
               No...

                               EARL
               Does it hurt?

                               VALIANT
               Not much.  It's hard to talk.

                               EARL
               Uh, Eddie, do me a favor.  Could you
               sit in the back so you won't cause as
               much of a commotion.

     Valiant tries to pull the brim of his hat down.  But it's
     comically small on the huge head.  He makes his way down the
     aisle past a veritable gauntlet of RAZZING, poking, tripping
     PASSENGERS.  Finally he finds an empty seat in the back as
     the Red Car starts up.


     A LITTLE KID

     wearing a baseball cap is sitting a few seats away with his
     MOTHER.  The Kid looks back at Eddie and laughs.  He leans
     over and whispers something to his Mom.

                               KID
               Can I, Mom?

                               MOMMY
               Go ahead, darling.  Take your bat.

     The Kid takes his baseball bat and approaches Valiant
     innocently.

                               KID
               Hi, Mr. Pig.  If I hit you on the head,
               will you make me a cuckoo bird?

     The Kid starts to take a swing with the bat.

                               VALIANT
               Kid, if you hit me on the head, I'm
               gonna throw you out this window.

     The Kid's eyes widen in terror.  This is not a typical Toon
     response.

                               KID
                      (crying)
                Mommy!


     INT. VALIANT'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY

     We hear the SOUND of the SHOWER.  Valiant's hand reaches out
     past the shower curtain and grabs for a bottle.  But it's not
     shampoo.  It's turpentine.

                               VALIANT (O.S.)
               Dammit!

     CLOSE - TUB DRAIN

     The water swirling down the drain is tinged with paint of
     different colors.


     CLOSE - VALIANT

     He scrubs manically until the last of the pig head is gone.
     He rinses off and he feels around his face.  The absence of
     the Toon mask seems to bring him some relief.  He shuts off
     the shower and slides the shower curtain back.


     VALIANT'S POV - JESSICA RABBIT

     is leaning up against the doorjamb, dressed as usual, in a
     black cocktail dress with elbow length gloves and pearls.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the
               doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear
               it.

                               VALIANT
               That's because I don't have a doorbell.

     Jessica, caught in her lie, flutters her eyelids nervously.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.

                               VALIANT
               Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a
               towel.

     As she hands him a towel, she stares down at his anatomy.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               What's that thing?

     Valiant looks down at what she's referring to.

                               VALIANT
               Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a
               mole before?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Toons aren't given imperfections.

                               VALIANT
               No?  I guess we're not counting lying,
               stealing and murder.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               You've got the wrong idea about me.
               I'a a pawn in this just like poor
               Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll
               pay you anything.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta
               have the rabbit to make the scam work.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               No, no, no... I love my husband.

                               VALIANT
               Oh, sure.  I can just feature you
               standin' outside your little hutch,
               holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby
               to come home.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr,
               Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is
               being a woman looking the way I do.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it
               is bein' a man looking at a woman
               looking the way you do.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.

                               VALIANT
               I'm not complainin'.  But give me
               credit.  I'm the guy who took the
               pictures of you and Acme playin'
               pattycake, remember?

     Jessica takes a cigarette out of her purse.  She lights it
     and blows a cloud of Toon smoke.  It forms a recreation of
     what she describes.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Maroon came to me.  He told me he'd
               fire Roger if I didn't do it.  I went
               along with him for Roger's sake.  It
               was only pattycake, after all.

     Valiant waves at the smoke scene, dispelling it.

                               VALIANT
               So altruistic.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               It's the truth.  Why won't you believe
               it?

                               VALIANT
               Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I
               don't know what you're up to, lady, but
               I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               If I'm as bad as you think, what's
               stopping me from just killing you right
               now?

     Valiant reaches behind him and picks up a small cup on the
     sink.

                               VALIANT
               This cup of turpentine right here.  Go
               for that gun in your purse and I'm
               gonna let you have it.

     Jessica breaks down and starts sobbing.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Oh, Mr, Valiant, please... you're my
               only hope.

     She comes to Eddie and hugs him, burying her head in his
     shoulder.

                                JESSICA RABBIT
               I'm weak... you're strong.  Can't you
               find a place somewhere in your heart to
               help me?

     Valiant looks down at the luscious creature in his arms,
     considering the request.  The moment is interrupted by the
     CLEARING of a VOICE.

                               DOLORES (O.C.)
               Dabblin' in watercolors, Eddie?

     Valiant, still in just a towel, sheepishly turns to face
     Dolores, who's standing in the doorway.

                               VALIANT
               Dolores...

     Dolores regards Jessica with undisguised contempt.

                               DOLORES
               Lemme guess... your cousin from Des
               Moines?

     Jessica straightens her dress.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Perhaps I should go.

                               DOLORES
               Must you?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Goodbye, Eddie... don't hate me.

     Jessica blows Eddie a TOON KISS which flies across the room,
     landing on Eddie's cheek.  She saunters past the smoldering
     Dolores and out the door.  Dolores walks to Eddie and peels
     the kiss off his cheek.  She crumples it up and throws it
     down in the wastebasket.

                               DOLORES
               What was that?

                               VALIANT
               That was the rabbit's wife.

                               DOLORES
               The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what
               she was doin' with her arms around you?

                               VALIANT
               Probably lookin' for a good place to
               stick a knife.

                               DOLORES
               I just stopped by to tell you that I
               checked out the Acme probate.

                               VALIANT
               Maroon, right?

                               DOLORES
               Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit
               again.

                               VALIANT
                      (startled)
               What the hell would they want with a
               gag factory?

                               DOLORES
               Got me.  But unless the will shows up
               by Friday midnight, it's theirs.

     As Valiant considers this new development, he cocks an ear.
     In the distance, we HEAR FAINT SINGING.

                               VALIANT
               What's that comin' from the bar?

                               DOLORES
                      (listens)
               Sounds like singin'.

                               VALIANT
               Oh, no...

     As Valiant grabs his pants...

                                              CUT TO:


     INT. TERMINAL BAR - DAY

     Roger's out all right.  In fact, he's using the bar as a
     stage for a song and dance number.  The tune is extremely
     familiar.  In fact, it's the one that opens every Warner
     Brothers cartoon...  The Looney Tune Anthem.  But we've never
     heard words to go with it.

                               ROGER RAB3IT
               'The merry-go-round broke down
               But you don't see me frown...'

     Roger grabs Augie's pad and pencil, scribbles some drawings
     lightning fast.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               'Things turned out fine
               And now she's mine...'

     Roger flips through the pad which in crude animation, shows
     the story of Roger and Jessica getting back together,
     culminating in them kissing in a heart.  Augie's delighted.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               '... Cause the merry-go-round
               Went round...
               Hoo-hoo, Hoo-hoo...'

     Roger does backflips and acts like an escapee from the acute
     ward.


     THE DOOR OPENS

     Eddie and Dolores enter.  Valiant stops in his tracks at the
     sight of Roger's performance... and the smiles on the faces
     of the sourpusses.


     CLOSE - ROGER

     doesn't see Eddie.  He moves into the next verse.  He twirls
     around on the post.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               'My name is Roger Rabbit
               I've got a crazy habit
               I like to sing and dance and yuk...'

     Roger goes to Angelo, lifts off his cap, and whacks his
     toupee, making it spin like a top.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               '... So brighten up and smile
               You schmuck'.

     All the regulars in the bar have a good laugh at that one.
     Now as Roger twirls around on the post, he smashes into a bar
     tray held by Eddie.  Valiant carries him toward the back
     room, but the irrepressable entertainer gets on his knees Al
     Jolson style and blows kisses to his audience.  The regulars
     are HOWLING as Roger is carried out.


     INT. BACK ROOM

     Valiant flings Roger into the room and slams the door behind
     him.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hey, don't I get an encore?

                               VALIANT
               Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out
               there riskin' my neck for you.   I come
               back here and you're singin' and
               dancin'.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               But that's my calling, my purpose, my
               raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to
               make people laugh... and believe me,
               those people needed a laugh.

                               VALIANT
               And when they're done laughin' , they're
               gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo
               would rat on you for a nickel!

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...

                               VALIANT
               An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He
               just got outta prison.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well... I still don't think he'd turn
               me in.

                               VALIANT
               Just because you got 'em to laugh?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie.
               Sometimes it's the only weapon we have
               in life.

                               VALIANT
               I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson
               variety.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I've met some cynical and miserable
               humans in my time.  But you, Edward
               Valiant, are positively funereal!

                               VALIANT
               Well, right now it's gonna be your
               funereal.

     Valiant takes his fist back to belt Roger.  Roger stands
     stoicly, jaw thrust forward, eyes closed.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Go ahead and throw that punch.
                      (opens one eye)
               But you'd be more successful with a
               punch line.

     Valiant drops his fist and rubs his temples with frustration.

                               VALIANT
               You're driving me crazy, you know that?
               Let's go... you ruined this as a hiding
               place.

     Valiant grabs Roger by the scruff of the neck and opens the
     door.  But he ducks back in quickly.


     VALIANT'S POW - THROUGH DOOR - JUDGE DOOM

     has entered the bar.  He stands FRAMED in the doorway,
     Voltaire perched on his shoulder.  The red light of the neon
     sign flashes on his glasses making him look like he's got
     burning coals for eyes.  With the Weasles at the door backing
     him up, the satanic Doom walks to the bar, his FOOTSTEPS
     CREAKING along the wooden floor.  He surveys the scene, leans
     over the bar for a glass.  Doom holds the glass up to the
     light and looks at it disgustedly.  He picks up a bottle of
     scotch and carries it down to where the one-armed Soldier is
     sitting.  Doom stares at him, then pulls the empty sleeve out
     of the amputee's pocket.  He uses it to wipe the inside of
     the glass.

                               DOOM
               I'm looking for a rabbit.  He was last
               seen in this neighborhood.

     The barflies avoid Doom's stare and shoot covered glances to
     one another.  But nobody says a word.  Doom pours a drink
     into his newly cleaned glass... then gently pours it down
     Voltaire's gullet.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               You couldn't miss him.  Buck teeth.
               Orange pants.  About yea big.

     Doom squashes the Midget's head down to approximate the size.

                               DOLORES
               There's no rabbit here, so don't harass
               my customers.

     Doom turns to Dolores.

                               DOOM
               I didn't come here to harass.  I came
               here to reward.

     Doom walks around Dolores toward the back.  But Doom stops
     next to the blackboard.  On it is written:  "Today's Special
     - French Dip - $ .50".  Doom erases the "French" and the
     decimal point in front of the "50".  Then he picks up the
     chalk and starts to write.  The CHALK SQUEAKS excruciatingly
     on the blackboard.  Everyone winces but watches anyway, as
     Doom writes "Rabbit" where the "French" was, and adds the
     zeroes to the "50".  It now reads:  "Rabbit Dip - $5000".


     AT THE BAR - ALL EYES

     are fixed on the figure on the blackboard.  Angelo licks his
     lips.

                               ANGELO
               Hey, I seen a rabbit...

     Angelo looks defensively at all his cronies and back to Doom.

                               ANGELO
                      (continuing)
               He's right here in the bar.

     But instead of pointing to the back of the bar, he talks to
     the empty barstool beside him.

                               ANGELO
                      (continuing)
               Say 'ello, Harvey.

     The tension is broken.  Everybody at the bar starts HOWLING.


     INT. BACK ROOM

     Roger turns to Eddie victoriously.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               My pal.


     IN THE BAR

     Doom stares down the regulars until the laughter stops.
     Meanwhile, a Weasle has started sniffing around the bar where
     Roger was dancing.  As Doom turns to leave, the Weasle
     whispers in his ear as he points to the back.  Doom smiles
     and pats the Weasle on the head.  He turns to Angelo and the
     others.

                                        DOOM
                Now we'll see who laughs best...

     The Weasle bloodhounds through the bar with Doom striding
     after him.  We FOLLOW them to the door to the back room.
     Doom rips the door open.


     INT. BACK ROON

     It's dark.  Doom flicks on the light.  REVEAL Valiant on the
     cot, his pint bottle cradled in his arm.  He blinks as if
     awakened from a drunken slumber.

                               DOOM
               Valiant?  Why is it that whenever my
               men smell a rabbit, you're there?

     Valiant plumps the pillow behind his head.

                               VALIANT
               Must be my cologne... Eau Dc Carrot.

                               WEASLE #1
                      (sniffs)
               He's in here all right, boss.

     Suddenly the Weasle grabs the pillow from under Valiant's
     head and carves it to shreds with a switchblade.  Feathers
     fly.  But no rabbit fur.

                               WEASLE #2
               Youse want we should take the place
               apart?

     The rest of the Weasles are arrayed behind Doom with Toon
     crowbars, picks, and a jackhammer.

                               DOOM
               No, Sergeant.  That won't be necessary.

     Doom walks over to the locker.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               I know a trick that no Toon can resist.

     Doom raps on the locker with his knuckles.  Da-da-da-da-da...
     It's a familiar pattern that demands a Da-da response.  Doom
     moves to the desk and tries it again.  Da-da-da-da-da...


     INSIDE A MAXWELL HOUSE COFFEE CAN

     Roger is hiding while sweating out the urge to finish the
     familiar coda.  We HEAR the RAPPING again, closer.
     Da-da-da-da-da...  Roger's biting his nails.


     DOOM

     moves to the milk crate the coffee can is on.  Valiant gets
     up off the cot.

                               VALIANT
               You know, Doom, I don't know who's
               Toonier, you or the rabbit.

     Doom just smiles and knocks the pattern out on the crate.

                               DOOM
               Shave... and... a haircut...

     Roger bursts out of the can with the lid on his head.  He
     responds con brio.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Two... bits!
                      (looks around)
               Uh... oh...

     PSSSHEW!  Roger flies out the door.


     INT. THE BAR

     He streaks across the bar and out the front door.   After a
     beat, two Weasles step into the bar holding the butterfly net
     they had stretched across the door.  They WHEEZE with glee at
     the struggling Roger trapped inside.  A third Weasle carries
     the Judge's briefcase.

     Doom strides confidently into the bar.

                               WEASLE
               Oyez... oyez... oyez... court is now in
               session.

     Valiant and Dolores are led out by a couple Weasles holding
     guns on them.  As Doom snaps the briefcase open on the bar,
     the twelve Kangaroos pop up in their jury box.  Doom raps on
     the bar with his gavel-headed cane.  The regulars watch the
     bizarre scene in stunned silence.

                               DOOM
               Roger Rabbit is charged with the cold
               blooded murder of a human... Marvin
               Acme.  The jury will direct their
               attention to exhibits A, B, and C.

     The Weasles display photographs of Jessica and Acme playing
     pattycake, a blow-up of his fingerprints spelling
     RogerRabbitRogerRabbit in the whorls on the photographs, and
     a picture of Acme lying under the safe.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Motive, evidence, modus operandi.  How
               do you find the defendant?

     Once again the Kangaroo court wastes no time delivering the
     verdict.  The Baby Kangaroos pop up with their Y-O-U A-R-E
     G-U-I-L-T-Y signs.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Guilty as charged.  Case closed!

     Doom slams the briefcase shut.  Now two Weasles wheel the
     stainless steel tub filled with dip into the bar.  Another
     hands Doom his black rubber gloves.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               For this heinous crime, I sentence you
               to the dip!

                               ROGER RABBIT
               No, no. not the dip!  Eddie, tell him
               I didn't do it!

                               VALIANT
               I don't think it's gonna matter.
               Sorry, pal, I tried.

                               DOOM
               Yes, and for that you're charged with
               aiding and abetting.  But we'll let
               Santino handle that.

     Doom pulls on the rubber gloves.

                               VALIANT
               Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last
               request?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs?
               Just kidding.

                               VALIANT
               I think you want a drink.
                      (to Doom)
               How about it, Judge?

                               DOOM
               Well, why not?  I'm feeling magnanimous
               tonight.  The successful conclusion of
               this case draws the curtain on my
               career as a jurist. I'm retiring to
               take a new role in the private sector.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah?  Well, don't expect the Toons to
               give you a gold watch.

     Valiant pours a glass of whiskey filling it all the way to
     the rim.  He holds it out to Roger.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper
               for me.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               But, Eddie, you know what happens
               when...

                               VALIANT
               Drink it, jerk.  All of it.

     He grabs Roger's hand and forces the drink into it.  Roger
     shrugs his shoulders and shoots the drink down.  We've seen
     the reaction before.  Suddenly Roger's head turns into a
     STEAM WHISTLE emitting such a PIERCING BLAST that is sends
     everyone into ear-grabbing agony.  Glasses, bottles, mirrors,
     even Doom's glasses SHATTER.  Valiant uses the distraction to
     punch the Weasles holding Roger.  He grabs the rabbit by the
     scruff of the neck. He gets as assist from Augie, who
     couldn't hear the noise.  Unfazed, Augie whacks a Weasle on
     the head with a barstool.  The Midget crawls behind Doom,
     who's been momentarily blinded.  The one-armed Soldier pushes
     him over.  Angelo is turning one Weasle's head around and
     around like a cruller.  Finally, Doom gets to his feet.

                               DOOM
               After them you fools...

     As the Weasles regroup, Valiant tips the stainless steel tub
     over sending the dip spilling toward them.  The Weasles
     recoil from the liquid.  Even Doom takes a step backward.


     EXT. TERMINAL BAR

     Eddie and Roger race down the stairs and toward the Toon
     Control Wagon which is parked in front of Doom's Lincoln,

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'.
               Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the
               noodle, the grey matter...

                               VALIANT
               If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin'
               from the law with a Toon?

     Valiant opens the door of the Toon Control wagon, and flings
     Roger inside roughly.


     INT. CAB

     Eddie goes to start the vehicle but the key is gone.   Now
     from behind them comes a DEEP RUMBLING VOICE somewhere
     between Lord Buckley and Barry White.

                               VOICE
               Excuse me, gentlemen...

     Eddie and Roger turn.  A snazzy TOON ROADSTER whose grill
     functions as it's mouth is talking from behind the liquid
     bars.

                               ROADSTER
                   If you effect my extrication, I
                   could offer you some carburetion.

     Valiant sighs with resignation and slides out of the cab,
     Roger in tow.


     EXT. REAR OF WAGON

     Eddie and Roger come racing around the side of the wagon.
     Valiant searches the back of the truck for the on/off switch.
     He finds it and turns off the flow of acetone.  The Roadster
     zips out of the truck and lands on the pavement, already
     flexing and limbering.   Behind him, a comical number of other
     TOON DETAINEES hop out like midgets out of a Volkswagon.

     They all head for the hills.

                               ROADSTER
               Well... what're we waitin' for, the
               William Tell Overture?


     ANGLE ON TERMINAL BAR - THE WEASLES

     come piling out.  They stack up like an Indian totem pole
     searching every direction.  One of them spots Eddie and
     Roger.  The Weasles stumble all over themselves in a mad
     scramble down the stairs.


     EDDIE AND ROGER

     hop into the sleek two-seater.   Valiant looks at the myriad
     of goofy cartoon gauges and switches on the Roadster's
     dashboard.

                               VALIANT
               What do I do?

                               ROADSTER
               You don't have to do nothin'...

     With a ferocious RUBBER BURNING SQUEAL, the Roadster ROARS
     off in "no frames".  The exit is so fast that Eddie and Roger
     are left behind, hanging mid-air.  But before they hit the
     ground, the Roadster zips back INTO FRAME.  Eddie and Roger
     fall back into their seats.  The Roadster bends around so his
     grill is facing them.

                               ROADSTER
                      (continuing)
               Uh... except hang onto your hat.

     The Roadster ROARS off again in a cloud of Toon dust.


     INT. SANTINO'S COP CAR

     coming the other way.  It's followed by another squad car,
     both with SIRENS BLARING.  When the red blur streaks by, Lt.
     Santino turns to his PARTNER.

                               LT. SANTINO
               What the hell was that?

                               PARTNER
               Speeding rabbit, Lieutenant.

                               LT. SANTINO
               That's what I was afraid of.


     EXT. STREET

     Santino's car does a 180 degree spin, and goes after the
     Roadster.  The second squad car follows.  The Weasles pile
     into the Toon Control wagon and join the chase.


     INT. THE ROADSTER

     rockets down the street, then takes a turn so wide that it
     drives up the front of the corner building, then back down on
     the sidewalk, just avoiding a newsstand.  The squad car
     following is not so dexterous.   It CRASHES into the stand,
     sending newspapers flying.


     THE ROADSTER

     looks back over it's shoulder, admiring his handiwork.

                               ROADSTER
               Read all about it, Benny's back in
               town!

     Up ahead, an egg delivery truck is double-parked in their
     lane.  Benny snaps around just as they're about to crash into
     the back of the truck.  There's nowhere to go.   But Benny's
     cool.

                               ROADSTER
               Going up...

     Suddenly, just before impact, the Toon suspension on the car
     accordions up, giving it a clearance of about fifteen feet...
     just enough to get over the truck.


     THE TOON CONTROL WAGON

     doesn't come with this unique feature.  It tries to avoid the
     truck but SMASHES into the back, splattering hundreds of eggs
     and sending the Weasles flying.


     EDDIE AND ROGER

     look down from their suspended position at the chaos behind.

                               ROADSTER
               Next floor, sundries, knick knacks,
               escaped convicts.  Watch your step.

     The Roadster accordions back down to it's original height and
     speeds past TWO MOTORCYCLE COPS.  The motorcycles ROAR after
     them.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hey, Benny, what were you in for?

                               ROADSTER
               Reckless driving.  Do you believe that?

                               VALIANT
               Hard to imagine.

     Benny zig-zags through traffic, scooting between cars, but
     the Motorcycle Cops manage to stay on his tail.  Up ahead,
     traffic is stopped in his lane.  With nowhere to go, Benny
     passes a trolley car moving down the center of the street.
     Suddenly, he swerves in front of the trolley to elude the
     Cops... only to see another Red Car coming the other way.

                               ROADSTER
               Hold your breath, babies...

     Benny sucks in his girth and gets on his tip-toes as the
     trollies pass on either side of them.


     WIDE SHOT

     When the trollies clear, Benny staggers out from between them
     still on tip-toes.  Benny plops down, squashes, then pops up
     to his old self again.


     BEHIND THEM

     The crippled Toon Control wagon is struggling to keep up.
     Voltaire circles above the truck and picks two Weasles up off
     the roof.  They're each carrying several sticks of dynamite.


     FROM THE AIR

     We see Voltaire flying after the Roadster, which is speeding
     along the palm-lined Elysian Park Drive.  The Weasles light
     the dynamite sticks and with WHEEZING delight, bombard the
     car below.


     BENNY

     swerves right and left dodging the EXPLOSIONS.  Now a stick
     of dynamite falls into the back seat, fuse burning.  Benny
     looks back.

                               ROADSTER
               Hate to sound like Chicken Little, but
               is the sky falling or what?

     Eddie and Roger turn to see the dynamite, fuse burning low.
     Valiant makes a desperate grab for it.  But it rolls under
     the front seat.  Roger jumps in Eddie's lap.


     ABOVE - VOLTAIRE AND THE WEASLES

     satisfied that they've hit their target, swoop back to the
     Toon Control wagon.


     IN THE ROADSTER

     Valiant tries to untangle himself from Roger.

                               VALIANT
               Grab it, you idiot!

     Finally, at the last second, Roger reaches down and picks the
     dynamite up like a hot potato.  He flips it out of the
     Roadster.


     THE DYNAMITE

     spins through the air, finally landing on the roof just as
     Voltaire and the Weasles arrive.  BOOM!  The Toon Control
     wagon is demolished.  When the smoke clears we see the
     Weasles and Voltaire scattered roadside, faces blackened,
     feathers smoking.


     EXT. ECHO PARK STREET

     Benny is leading a merry chase up and down the hills.  Beside
     the two Motorcycles, there are half a dozen squad cars.  But
     as Benny comes over the last rise, we see the road deadends
     at Echo Park Lake.  The police have blocked off the
     perpendicular streets with squad cars.  Eddie and Roger see
     the deadend fast approaching.  Roger covers his eyes with his
     ears.  Valiant braces himself.

                               VALIANT
               The brakes!  The brakes!

     Benny hits the brakes.  Smoke pours out as they burn up and
     the momentum is barely broken.

                               ROADSTER
               Forget the brakes, who brought the
               water wings?

     The Roadster SMASHES through the wooden guard rail and sails
     out over the water.  KERPLOP!  It splashes down in the lake.


     THE POLICE CARS

     SCREECH to a stop at the edge of the lake.  Santino jumps out
     and regards the floating Roadster.  He turns to the other
     cops with a smirk.  When he turns back again, the smirk
     disappears from his face.


     ANGLE ON LAKE

     Benny is calmly swimming away using his fenders to do the
     crawl.  Now they pass a spooning COUPLE in a rowboat.  The
     couple regard them open-mouthed.


     THE EDGE OF THE LAKE

     Benny nears the shoreline, touches bottom and wades out.
     When they hit dry land, Benny shakes off like a dog.  He REVS
     HIS ENGINE.

                               ROADSTER
               Maybe it's my imagination, but I always
               seem to run better after I've had a
               wash.
                     (turns)
               Now where can I drop you cats?

     As Benny ROARS off...

                                              CUT TO:


     EXT. ALLEY - DAY

     Benny peeks around the corner, then tip-toes into view. down
     the alley until he stops in front of a back door.  Eddie and
     Roger climb out.

                               VALIANT
               Thanks, Benny.

                               ROADSTER
               If you ever need me, just stick out
               your thumb.

     WHOOSH!  Benny is gone.  Valiant goes to the door and unlocks
     it.  As he and Roger head up the back stairs...

                                              CUT TO:


     INT. BUILDING - CLOSE - DOORWAY

     A hand painted design on the rippled glass shows a knight on
     a white charger.  On the shield in bold letters it says,
     "Veritas".  And lettered around it -- "Valiant and Valiant -
     Private Investigation".


     VALIANT

     sticks his key in the door and unlocks it.  Roger studies the
     banner.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other
                Valiant?

                               VALIANT
                My brother.  Get inside.

     He pushes Roger into the office.


     INT. OFFICE

     It's a typical detective office -- a couch, a sink, a window
     -- except for the partner's desk in the middle of the room.
     There's a chair on each side.  Valiant closes the door and
     locks it.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                So what's our plan, our scenario, our
                modus operandi?

                               VALIANT
                We can't do anything till it's dark.

     Valiant picks up some yellowed newspapers off the couch and
     dumps them on the floor.  They leave a clean spot on the
     couch.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Guess you haven't been here in a while.
                     (reads
                      headline)
                'Japs Bomb Pearl Harbor'.

     Roger walks over to the wall.  He takes a framed picture off
     the wall which shows two guys clowning with Mickey Mouse.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Say, who's this guy laughin'?

                               VALIANT
                Me.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've
                never seen you laugh before.  That your
                brother makin' the rabbit ears?

                               VALIANT
                What is this, Twenty Questions?

     Valiant grabs the picture from Roger and re-hangs it.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
                I'm gonna get some sleep.  I suggest
                you do the same.
         
     Valiant stretches out on the couch.  Roger nudges him to move
     over so he can lie down.  Grudgingly, Valiant slides over a
     fraction giving Roger a tiny piece of the couch.  They lie
     head to foot.


     CLOSEUP - VALIANT

     The problems of the day are knitting his brow.  Finally his
     eyes close.  After a beat, we HEAR Roger SNORING.  It's LOUD.
     Valiant's eyes pop open.  He rolls over.  WIDEN THE SHOT to
     see what he sees.


     ABOVE ROGER'S HEAD - A TOON DREAM BUBBLE

     has appeared.  Inside the bubble is a saw sawing back and
     forth through a log.  It is SYNCHRONIZED to the SOUND of
     Roger's SNORE.  Valiant kicks Roger, trying to stop the
     infernal SOUND.

     Roger sits up.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Huh?

     In the dream bubble, the saw cuts through the log.  One end
     of the log falls out of the bubble and BONKS Roger on the
     head, knocking him unconscious.  Valiant shakes his head and
     closes his eyes again.  We PAN UP off his face and PAST the
     window where the sun is setting.  As the CAMERA MOVES ALONG
     THE WALL, we see a gallery of framed newspaper clippings.
     "Valiant and Valiant Crack Popeye Kidnapping - Return Sweepea
     to Loving Arms of Parents".  And... "Brothers Find Brothers:
     Heckle and Jeckle Rescued From Redwood Forest!"  And...
     "Goofy Cleared of Atomic Spying Charges".  The PAN CONTINUES
     until we get to the window again.  Now it's dark outside.
     MOVE DOWN to Valiant's sleeping face.  He stirs. then opens
     one eye.  Now they both pop open at what he sees.


     VALIANT'S POV

     Roger has a magnifying glass an inch in front of his face
     that distorts his grinning face hideously.


     VALIANT

     startled from his sleep, reflexively shoves Roger away from
     him.  He flies into a swivel chair and goes spinning around.

                               VALIANT
                You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked
                you for the patsy.  Always gotta play
                the fool.  You make me sick!

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience,
                but what happened to you that was so
                dark, lurid, embittering?

                               VALIANT
                You wanna know?  Well, since you're so
                goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of
                you Toons killed my brother.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                A Toon?  Noooo.

                               VALIANT
                Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who
                killed Bambi's mother.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous,
                despicable... a smear on the drafting
                board.

                               VALIANT
                Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and
                Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All
                Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em.
                And when this guy was accused of
                knockin' over the First National Bank
                of Toontown, we took his case.  But
                when we looked into it, we found out he
                did do it after all.  We went to his
                house to take him in.  But he was wise.
                He got the drop on us... literally.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (wincing)
                Safe?
         
                               VALIANT
                Piano.  Guy got away, disappeared into
                Toontown.  Nobody ever saw him again.

     Now the PHONE on the desk RINGS.  Roger makes a move to it.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                I'll get it.

                               VALIANT
                Get away from there.

     The PHONE RINGS TWO MORE TIMES and stops.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Wrong number?

                               VALIANT
                No, it's not.

     Valiant goes to the phone anticipating a RING which comes
     after a moment.  Valiant picks up the receiver.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Dolores?
         
                                              INTERCUT:


     DOLORES

     on the phone in the Terminal Bar.

                               DOLORES
               I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's
               called here about four times.  He says
               he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He
               says he can help you.

                               VALIANT
               I'll bet.

                               DOLORES
               Are you gonna call him, Eddie?

                               VALIANT
               What've I got to lose?  You okay,
               Dolores?

                               DOLORES
               Yeah... they closed me down for a
               coupla weeks.

                               VALIANT
               That'll work out just fine.  When this
               thing is over, I'll take you to
               Catalina.  How does that sound?

                               DOLORES
               Familiar.  Be careful, Eddie.

     Dolores hangs up the phone.

                                              INTERCUT TO:


     VALIANT

     He CLICKS the switchhook and dials.
         
                               VALIANT
               Maroon?  Whaddaya want?

                               MAROON
                      (on phone)
               Have you got the will?

                               VALIANT
               Maybe.  Why?

                               MAROON
                      (on phone)
               Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock.
               If you've got the will maybe we can
               stop this thing.

                               VALIANT
               Stop what?

     CLICK.  Maroon has hung up.  Valiant hangs up the phone and
     goes to a wall safe.  He spins the combination.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are
               ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine
               o'clock.

                               VALIANT
               That's why I'll be there at 8:45.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I tell you what, maybe I better come
               with you.

                               VALIANT
               Forget it.

     Valiant reaches into the safe for a .38 revolver.  He checks
     the cylinder. Then he takes out a wooden box about 8" X 12".
     He closes the safe, picks up a black doctor's bag and puts
     the box and the revolver into it.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a
               chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you
               think.

                               VALIANT
               How much is a shave and a haircut,
               Roger?

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (sheepish)
               Two bits.

                               VALIANT
               I rest my case.

     Valiant goes to the door, pauses.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               If I don't make it back here by ten...

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Yeah?

                               VALIANT
               ... I'd head for Cucamonga.

     Valiant closes the door, leaving Roger alone.  Roger paces
     back and forth manically.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Cucamonga?  I don't know anybody in
               Cucamonga.


     EXT. MAROON STUDIO - NIGHT

     The lot is dark and deserted.  Now headlights cut through the
     darkness as Maroon's Packard pulls up in front of the
     Administration building.


     INT. CAR - MAROON

     reaches over and opens the glove compartment.  He takes out a
     small automatic.  But his hands are so slippery with
     perspiration, it falls to the floor.  Cursing, he takes out
     a handkerchief, wipes his hands and his face and picks up the
     gun again.  As he gets out of the car, we see the clock says
     8:55.


     INT. ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - NIGHT

     Maroon hustles up to his office door.  He looks nervously
     over his shoulder, then goes inside.


     INT. MAROON'S OFFICE

     Maroon switches on the lights.  He goes to his desk.  He
     takes out the gun and puts it in the left hand drawer.  Then
     he takes it out and puts it in the right hand drawer.  Then
     back to the original drawer.  Finally satisfied, he goes to
     the bar to calm his obviously shattered nerves.  As his
     shakey hand starts to pour from the decanter, another hand
     comes INTO FRAME.

                               VALIANT
               Steady, R.K., that stuff's eighteen
               years old.

     Maroon jumps back as Valiant steps from behind the curtain,
     holding his black bag.

                               MAROON
               Valiant!  You surprised me.

                               VALIANT
               That was the idea.

     Valiant takes over the pouring duties.  He turns and carries
     Maroon's drink to him.  Maroon goes and sits down in his
     chair.  He looks to the pistol hiding place.  Valiant
     casually sits on the desk, putting his legs over the drawer.

                               VALIANT
               You're not too good at this, are you,
               R.K.?

                               MAROON
               No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker,
               not a murderer.

                               VALIANT
               Well, everybody needs a hobby.

                               MAROON
               No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I
               had nothin' to do with Acme gettin'
               killed.  I just wanted to sell my
               studio.  But they wouldn't buy my
               property unless Acme would sell his.
               And he wouldn't.  So I was gonna
               blackmail Acme with pictures of him and
               the rabbit's wife.

     Maroon gets up from his chair, highly agitated.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               But then it all went to hell.  I been
               around Toons all my life.  I can't sit
               around and see them all destroyed.

     Maroon eyes Valiant's black bag.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               You got the will in there, don't ya?

                               VALIANT
               No, I don't.

                               MAROON
               You tricked me, damn you!

                               VALIANT
               Take it easy.

                               MAROON
               There's no time to take it easy!  You
               don't realize the diabolical mind we're
               dealing with!


     ANGLE ON WINDOW

     A gun pokes through the open window past the curtain.  It's a
     Colt .45 Buntline -- an unmistakeable gun with an extra long
     barrel.

                               MAROON
               If I don't get that will by midnight
               tonight, Toontown's just gonna be land
               for the free...


     VALIANT

     sees a reflection of the gun on the glass on a movie poster
     on the wall.  He turns.  But it's too late.  BANG!  BANG!
     BANG!  Maroon crumples, caught mid-sentence.  Valiant dives
     behind the desk and draws his gun.  He looks over at Maroon's
     dead body on the floor.

                               VALIANT
               And the home of the brave?

     Valiant crawls to the window where the shots came from.  He
     looks out.


     VALIANT'S POV

     The comely silhouette of Jessica Rabbit runs to her car,
     jumps in and ROARS out the the studio gates.


     VALIANT

     grabs his black bag, climbs out of the office window and
     jumps off the fire escape to the lot below.


     EXT. STUDIO LOT

     Valiant hops into Maroon's Packard.  He hits the starter
     button and takes off after Jessica.


     NEW ANGLE

     as the car pulls away, the trunk lid lifts.  Roger Rabbit
     peers out, disoriented.  Then closes it.


     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     Jessica's car speeds along.  Valiant is in close pursuit in
     the Packard.  He's about to catch up on the straightaway when
     Jessica's car disappears into a tunnel.


     VALIANT

     slams on his brakes.  The Packard goes fishtailing, finally
     spinning to a stop at the foot of the "Toontown" sign.

     Valiant gets out of the car.  He looks down the tunnel.  He's
     sweating.  He loosens his necktie.  He paces back and forth
     at the tunnel mouth.  He looks up at the Toontown sign and
     suddenly smashes it with his fist.  It spins around like a
     weathervane.

     Valiant walks to the Packard with purpose.  He grabs the
     black bag and puts it on the hood.  He opens it and takes out
     the wooden box.


     CLOSE - BOX

     as the clasp is popped and the box opened, REVEAL a stunning
     presentation model TOON .38 resting on crushed velvet.  It's
     everything a real gun could be... and more.  Each feature is
     exaggerated... the barrel, the cylinder, the ivory grips are
     all Toon-sized.


     VALIANT

     picks the gun up and hefts it respectfully.  Then he opens an
     ammo section in the wooden box. SIX TOON .38 DUM-DUM BULLETS
     are in velvet creases.  The Toon Bullets blink to life as if
     awakening from a long sleep.

                               DUM-DUM #l
                      (rubbing eyes)
               Eddie... is that really you?

                               VALIANT
               Uh-huh.

                               DUM-DUM #2
               What year is it?

                               VALIANT
               '46.

                               DUM-DUM #3
               Who won the war?

                               DUM-DUM #4
               Who do you think, dummy?

                               DUM-DUM #5
               Welcome back, Eddie.

                               DUM-DUM #6
               Where you been the last five years?

                               VALIANT
               Drunk.

     He opens the cylinder.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Feelin' frisky tonight, boys?

                               DUM-DUMS
               Yeah!

     The Bullets eagerly dive into their respective chambers.  He
     snaps the cylinder closed, reaches into his shoulder holster
     and takes out the pint bottle.  He unscrews the cap and pours
     the rest of the booze onto the ground.  When it's drained, he
     flings the bottle in the air and FIRES the Toon .38.  KA-POW!
     It makes a SOUND like a CANNON.


     THE TOON BULLET

     climbs like a rocket into the dark sky.  It SCREECHES up to
     the bottle, puts on the brakes.  The Bullet puts on a
     jeweler's eyepiece, then it whips out a little hammer and
     chisel acd delivers one delicate tap.


     VALIANT

     watches as a cut glass chandelier falls out of the sky and
     CRASHES at his feet.  Valiant holsters his weapon and climbs
     into the Packard.  He puts it in gear and pulls into the
     tunnel.


     IN THE TUNNEL - DRIVING

     As Valiant heads toward the proverbial light at the end of
     the tunnel, suddenly the CAR RADIO COMES ON.

                               RADIO ANNOUNCER
               ... From the tippy tip top of
               Toontown's Tip Top Club, this is Mellow
               Melody Matinee.  Here's our favorite
               cricket, Jimmy, with 'Give A Little
               Whistle'.

                               JIMINY CRICKET
                      (on radio)
               'When you get in trouble, and you don't
               know right from wrong...'

     Valiant turns the on/off switch, then punches all the buttons
     but to no avail.  The SONG PLAYS ON anyway.

                               JIMINY CRICKET
                      (continuing)
               '... Give a little whistle
               Give a little whistle...'

                               VALIANT
               I hate Toontown...

     As Jimmy croons on, Valiant emerges from the tunnel.


     VALIANT'S FOV

     Through the windshield we see we have arrived in Toontown,
     where it's a beautiful sunny day.  Eddie is now driving down
     a phantasmagorical boulevard in a completely animated world.
     It's a Max Fleischer version of a city neighborhood.  The
     trees and buildings are swaying in time with the MUSIC.
     Eddie looks to his left and sees a huge Aphrodite-like hood
     ornament on the front of a TOON CAR.  Then as the car starts
     to pass him he sees hood... hood... hood... more hood then a
     CHAUFFEUR, then more car, and finally the Wolf we remember
     from the Ink & Paint Club.  He's in top hat and tails, a TOON
     LAMB in the passenger seat.  He tips his hat.

                               WOLF
               Helloooo, cousin.

     Now he drives past a Toon building under construction.  Like
     everything else in Toontown. the construction company sports
     the name "Acme".  The sign out frontsays:  WATCH OUR
     PROGRESS.  Eddie looks up, and before he can drive by, the
     building gets built floor by floor with accompanying SFX in
     about two seconds.

     Up ahead, the street is clear for blocks.  Then suddenly cars
     pour out of all side streets at once, clogging the boulevard
     like arteriosclerosis.  There is mad HONKING in this cartoon
     traffic jam.  Eddie shakes his head.  He pulls over, parks
     and gets out.

     Valiant pulls out his Toon .38.  Suddenly, the street empties
     in the blink of an eye.  Shutters close, and the sidewalk
     rolls up like window shades.  It's so quiet you could hear a
     pin drop.  In fact, a PIN DROPS from a second story window,
     landing with the CLANG! of a manhole cover.  All is quiet
     again.  Valiant starts across the street -- there is a CREAK
     behind him.  Valiant whirls around, levelling his pistol at
     the sound.


     ANGLE ON PACKARD - ROGER

     peeks out of the trunk of Maroon's car.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Don't shoot, Eddie.  It's me.

     Valiant lowers the gun as Roger emerges.

                               VALIANT
               What the hell are you doin' in there?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I followed you to the Maroon Studios.
               When I heard those shots, I thought I'd
               help you and investigate the inside of
               this trunk.

     Valiant reaches into the black bag in the car.  He comes out
     with a pair of TOON HANDCUFFS.  He slaps one on Roger's
     wrist.

                               ROGER RA13BIT
                      (continuing)
               Hey, what're you doin'?

     Valiant drags Roger to the steering wheel.

                               VALIANT
               I'm making sure you don't help me
               anymore.

     He locks the cuff to it, and heads across the street.


     AROUND THE CORNER - VALIANT

     stops at a street sign.  The post is bristling with fingers
     pointing in different directions; i.e., Poughkeepsie,
     Transylvania, Walla Walla, South Pole (the finger points down
     of course), and finally a finger which says:  The Dame.
     Eddie follows the finger down the side street to a high rise
     building.

     He catches a glimpse of Jessica darting into the elevators.
     Valiant hustles inside after her.

     Valiant goes to the elevators, and watches the floor
     indicator spinning round and Round, finally stopping with a
     BING at the 125th floor.  The elevator doors open and Valiant
     steps on.


     IN THE ELEVATOR

     Valiant punches 125.  Suddenly the elevator takes out with
     such velocity that Valiant is thrown to the floor.  After a
     moment, it stops so fast that he hits the ceiling.  Then
     bounces back to the floor as the doors open.  He picks
     himself up and steps off the elevator.

     He's in a foyer with four doors.  Valiant opens the first and
     steps inside.  He disappears.


     NEW ANGLE

     Valiant is on the outside of the building hanging onto a
     flagpole for dear life.  He looks down at the street which
     looks miles below.  Valiant inches back along the flagpole to
     the door and pulls himself to safety.


     INSIDE - VALIANT

     tries the next door.  This time more carefully.  A SPEEDING
     TRAIN is coming right at him.  He slams the door.  He tries
     the next one.  A homely OLD TOON LADY is in a bathtub.  She
     lets out a BLOODCURDLING SCREAM.  Valiant closes that door
     quickly, and turns to the last.  When he opens this one, we
     HEAR FOREBODING MUSIC.  We see...


     A DARK ALLEY

     Warily, Valiant walks into the alley, gun drawn.  There's a
     NOISE behind the garbage cans.  Valiant turns as a DEAD BODY
     with a knife in his back falls out of the shadows at
     Valiant's feet.  A SQUEAKY VOICE comes from behind Valiant.

                               VOICE
               I guess they didn't clean up after the
               last moider.

     Valiant whips around to see a TOON RAT perched on a skull
     picking his teeth.  Valiant kicks the skull.  The rat
     scrambles for cover.

     As Valiant continues on, we see...


     JESSICA RABBIT

     Steps out of the shadows behind him and aim the gun at his
     back.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Don't move, Valiant.

     Valiant turns slowly to see Jessica's got a bead on him with
     her revolver.

                               VALIANT
               Well... I always figured I'd get it in
               Toontown.

     BLAM!  She fires.  But Valiant's still standing.  We HEAR a
     CRASH behind Eddie as a figure falls into some boxes from a
     fire escape above.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               I think I got him.

     Jessica runs past Valiant to the figure.  He follows,
     bewildered.


     ANGLE ON GROUND

     We can see two rabbit ears sticking out from behind a box

                               VALIANT
               You shot Roger.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's
               men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.

     Jessica moves the box aside and tugs on the rabbit ears.  The
     rabbit head pops off.  Underneath is a Weasle.  In his hand
     is the Colt .45 Buntline.

                               VALIANT
               Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Don't worry, you're not the first.  We
               better get out of here.

     As they run down the alley...

                                              CUT TO:


     THE PACKARD - ROGER

     is behind the wheel making ENGINE NOISES like a little kid.
     He pushes all the buttons, windshield wipers, convertible
     top, etcetera, until he accidentally hits the starter button.
     VROOM!  The Packard fires to life.  Roger's startled for a
     moment, but quickly regains his composure.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hmmm... What would be the harm if I
               took her for a spin?

     He throws it into gear.  The Packard bucks into the car in
     front of it.  Then Roger shifts again.  The same process is
     repeated in reverse.  He SMASHES back and forth.  BANG!
     BANG!

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
                Ah... the open road.


     AROUND THE CORNER - EDDIE AND JESSICA

     come racing down the street.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?

                               VALIANT
               Why didn't you tell me?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               I didn't know who I could trust.

                               VALIANT
               We're even.  By the way, I did find
               your husband.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (excited)
               Where is he?

                               VALIANT
               He's right here in the...

     Valiant rounds the corner and points toward the spot where
     the car used to be.  But all that remains is a crumpled
     bumper.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               ... car.

     He shakes his head and looks around for signs of Roger.

                                              INTERCUT TO:


     THE PACKARD

     is careening down Toon streets totally out of control.
     Panicked, Roger is spinning the wheel as if it were a
     motorboat.  He drives in one side of Mother Goose's Shoe and
     out the other, diapers all over the windshield.  Unable to
     see, Roger steers right off the road.  The car hurtles
     through space.  As it starts to fall, we see it's Toon
     Monument Valley.  The Packard passes a promontory on which
     WILE E. COYOTE is perched.  As Roger passes, he waves to the
     Coyote.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hi, Roger Rabbit.  Love your work.

                                              INTERCUT TO:


     EDDIE AND JESSICA

     who are now facing a squad of TEN Toon Control Weasles.  They
     unleash a fusilade of bullets.

     Valiant knocks Jessica to the ground.  The bullets pass
     harmlessly overhead going into the window of the Acme Cheese
     Shop, riddling a round of cheese.  The CHEESEMAKER'S hand
     comes INTO FRAME changing the sign that says "Gouda" to
     "Swiss".

     Valiant rolls and FIRES his Toon .38 Special.  The Toon
     Bullet turns into a cannonball, which rolls down the street
     busting up the Weasle squad like a bowling ball through ten
     pins.

     As Eddie pulls Jessica to her feet, two more Weasles descend
     on them.  They fling Toon knives, which pin Eddie to a wooden
     fence.  Valiant rips one hand free, and BLASTS two shots at
     them.

     The Toon Bullets get to the Weasles, and open their nose
     cones.  Two frying pans emerge and BONK the Weasles on the
     head.

     Jessica starts to pull the knives out, releasing Eddie.

                               VALIANT
               How did you get onto Doom?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Marvin told me.  Doom was after his
               land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he
               brought me his will.

     Valiant sees a Weasle skulking at them with a tommygun.
     BLAM!  Valiant fires at him.  The Weasle ducks back around
     the corner.  But Valiant's Dum-Dum SCREECHES to a stop and
     goes around the corner, too.  We HEAR an EXPLOSION.  The
     Weasle come staggering out and falls in the street.

                               VALIANT
               So where is it?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               When I opened up the blue envelope, all
               that was inside was a blank piece of
               paper.

                               VALIANT
               A joker to the end.

     Now Weasles are coming at them from every direction.  Valiant
     aims the Toon .38 at a Toon tank rolling their way.  But when
     he pulls the trigger, the gun just CLICKS.  Empty.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Looks like our goose is cooked, our
               hash is slung, our fait is accompli...

                               VALIANT
               Lemme guess where you got that from.
               Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see
               in that guy anyway?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               He made me laugh.

     Valiant shakes his head.  Now they are completely surrounded
     by Weasles.  The situation looks bleak.

                               VALIANT
               Well, do you prefer to die this way or
               that way?

     Valiant jerks his thumb indicating the direction behind him.
     Suddenly, there's a rubber-burning SCREECH as Benny the
     Roadster arrives next to Valiant's hitchhiker-posed thumb.

                               ROADSTER
               Need a lift?

     Valiant does a take.

                               VALIANT
               Benny.

     The Roadster looks back approvingly as Jessica climbs in with
     Eddie.

                               ROADSTER
               Mr. Valiant, you've made a vast
               improvement in the company you keep.

     Benny blasts through a couple of Weasles.  They swing back
     and forth like tavern doors, then topple.

     He takes a hard right into the next block which is the Toon
     Arctic.  His tires turn into skis.  He slaloms back and forth
     between trees.  The Weasles pursue on dogsled.

     Benny grabs a striped barber's pole -- the North Pole -- and
     slides down it.  They land in the Toon Sahara.  Benny crawls
     up a large sand dune, his tongue hanging out of his radiator.
     He glances back at the Weasles who are mounted on camels,
     waving scimitars.  When they reach the top of the sand dune,
     we see they're on the precipice of a bottomless chasm.

                               ROADSTER
               Look, the drawbridge -- we're gonna
               make it.

                               VALIANT
               I don't see any bridge.

                               ROADSTER
               That's because you gotta draw it first.

     Benny takes a pencil hanging from a post lettered "Draw
     Bridge".  He wets the pencil point and in a flash draws a
     bridge.  It's a rickety rope bridge.  Using the pencil as a
     balancing pole, Benny starts to tiptoe across.

     The Weasles jump off t'heir camels and start filing onto the
     bridge after them.

     When Benny finally reaches the other side, Valiant grabs the
     pencil from him and gets out of the car.

                               VALIANT
               Hold on a second.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Eddie, come on.

     But Valiant stands facing the Weasles, who are charging at
     him, swords raised.  With a sly smile, Valiant holds up the
     eraser end of the pencil.  This freezes the Weasles.  But as
     Valiant starts to erase a rope support, the eraser breaks off
     the pencil and falls down into the chasm.  The Weasles WHEEZE
     with relief and advance for the kill.  At the last second,
     Valiant takes the business end of the pencil and scribbles a
     handsaw.  He grabs it by the handle and saws the rope.  The
     bridge swings away, smacking the Weasles into the opposite
     canyon wall.  One by one, they slide off and disappear into
     the abyss.


     VALIANT

     climbs back into Benny.  The Roadster takes off again, making
     a skidding left turn onto the main drag.  As they make their
     break into the Toontown tunnel...


     EXT. TOONTOWN TUNNEL - L.A. SIDE - NIGHT

     A ten gallon drum is sitting by the side of the road under
     the Toontown sign.  From in the tunnel we hear the SOUND of
     Benny's ENGINE coming closer.  Now a foot comes out of the
     shadows and rests on the ten gallon drum.  As the SOUND of
     the ROADSTER gets VERY LOUD, the foot kicks the drum over,
     spilling a clear liquid across the road.


     NEW ANGLE - THE FOOT

     belongs to Judge Doom.  Doom smiles sadistically as the
     Roadster with Eddie and Jessica aboard comes shooting out of
     the tunnel.  When Benny hits the liquid, he starts to skid.

                               ROADSTER
               Uh-oh... whoaaa...!  Look out!

     His tires smoke, then disappear. It's a dip slick.  Without
     tires, Benny spins out of control, finally ending up in the
     bushes roadside.

     Before Eddie and Jessica can make a move, they are surrounded
     by a horde of Weasles pointing what looks like a hundred guns
     at them.

                               DOOM
               Are you two all right?

     Doom opens one of the Roadster's doors and helps Jessica out.
     Valiant climbs out after her.  The Weasles quickly relieve
     him of his Toon pistol.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               These roads can be very treacherous at
               night, especially in a maniacal Toon
               vehicle.

                               VALIANT
               The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.

                               DOOM
               I've had enough of your insolence!
                      (to Weasles)
               Put him in my car.  I think they'll
               enjoy attending our ribbon cutting at
               the Acme factory.

     The Weasles prod Valiant and Jessica into Doom's Lincoln.  A
     Weasle refers to Benny WHIMPERING in the bushes.

                               WEASLE
               What about him?

                               DOOM
               He's not going anywhere.  We'll send
               the mobile unit after him.

     Doom climbs into the car and it zooms off, Weasles jumping
     onto the running boards.


     BENNY

     crawls out of the bushes on his axles.

                               ROADSTER
               The boinin', the boinin'...

     He makes it down into the drainage ditch, dipping his
     tootsies one by one.  There's a HISS as they hit the water
     and the chemicals from the dip are extinguished.

                               ROADSTER
                      (continuing)
               Oh, yeah... that's better.

     Now Benny hears the SOUND of another VEHICLE COMING out of
     the Toontown Tunnel.  He ducks down and peeks over the ditch
     to see...


     ROGER IN THE PACKARD

     come SCREAMING out of the tunnel backwards.  Maroon's Packard
     looks like the winner of a demolition derby.

     Benny stands and waves to him.

                               ROADSTER
               Roger!

     Roger sees him and slams on the brakes, skidding the Packard
     into the Toontown sign.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Benny?

     Benny hobbles over to the Packard.  He pops his trunk and
     rummages around.  He comes out with Toon boltcutters.  He
     clips Roger's cuffs off.

                               ROADSTER
               Doom's got your wife and Valiant.  He
               took them to the Acme factory,

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Let's go!

     Benny nudges Roger to the passenger side.

                               ROADSTER
               Slide over, son.  It looks like you've
               done enough drivin' for tonight.

     Now the Toon Roadster gingerly gets behind the wheel of the
     Packard.  He hits the gas and the Packard lurches down the
     road.


     INT. ACME FACTORY - NIGHT

     Doom's car is parked inside.  There are several other
     vehicles as well.  There's a steamroller, a road grader, and
     a huge modified tanker truck.  It's mounted with a thousand
     gallon vat, the contents of which are being stirred by a
     motorized unit.  All the vehicles are marked with a large
     green four-leaf clover logo.


     VALIANT AND JESSICA

     are held at gunpoint by a couple of Weasles, while several
     others are busy JACKHAMMERING the brick wall at the far end
     of the factory.  Doom pulls on his rubber gloves, turns to
     the Weasles.

                               DOOM
               Frisk them.  See if they have the will.

     Several Weasles rush for the opportunity to frisk Jessica.
     The head Weasle slaps the others away.  Then WHEEZING
     laciviously, he turns to the task.  He starts to move his
     hands over her body when Jessica stomps her heel on his feet.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Get your hands off me, you little
               rodent!

     The Weasle hops away angrily and quickly frisks Valiant.  He
     turns to Doom and shakes his head.

                               DOOM
               No matter.
                      (checks watch)
               I don't expect the will to show up in
               the next fifteen minutes.  By then
               Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite
               legally.

                               VALIANT
               So you're Cloverleaf?

                               DOOM
               No one person is Cloverleaf.  We're a
               vast company with diverse interests...
               gasoline, tires, automobiles.


     AT THE BRICK WALL

     The jackhammering has stopped.  A Weasle plucks one brick out
     of the wall.  Toon light beams through.  He reaches into the
     hole in the wall and comes out holding a bunch of Toon
     bananas.  WHEEZING wickedly, he passes them out to his
     compatriots.  They devour the bananas, throwing the peels
     helter-skelter.


     VALIANT

     turns his attention from the brick wall back to Doom.

                               VALIANT
               Come on, Doom.  What would a company
               like that want with Toontown?

                               DOOM
               It wasn't Toontown they wanted.  It was
               my idea of how to put the land to
               better use.

     Doom goes to the truck and starts turning on valves and
     starting compressors.
                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               In fact, they thought my concept so
               brilliant, that they offered me the
               Directorship of Transportation.  I've
               accepted.
                      (to Weasle)
               Bring me Mr. Valiant's gun.

     The Weasle trots over and delivers Valiant's Toon .38.  Doom
     inspects it.  He reads an engraving on the frame.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               'Thanks for getting me out of the
               hoosegow.  Yosemite Sam'.
                      (looks up)
               How sweet.

     Doom throws the gun on the ground.  He pushes back a long
     lever on the truck, letting loose a tiny spurt of fluid from
     the discharge valve.  The gun disappears.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Dip?

                               DOOM
               That's right.  Enough to dip Toontown
               off the face of the earth.


     EXT. ACME FACTORY - ROGER AND BENNY

     have been watching the proceedings through a window.  They
     turn to each other stunned.

                               BENNY/ROGER RABBIT
               Dip Toontown?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               We gotta do something!

     Roger scurries back to the Packard hidden outside the gates.
     He opens Valiant's black bag and comes out holding Eddie's
     real pistol.  Benny comes tenderfooting up.

                               ROADSTER
               Roger, what're you gonna do with that
               gun?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I'm gonna save them, of course.  You go
               for help.  Find Dolores at the Terminal
               Bar.  She'll know what to do.

                               ROADSTER
               Well... all right...

     Reluctantly, Benny gets behind the wheel of the Packard.

                               ROADSTER
                      (continuing)
               But you be careful now with that gun.
               This ain't no cartoon.

     Benny pulls away.  Roger turns with determination and zips
     back to the window


     INT. FACTORY

     Doom pulls the tarp off the top of the truck, revealing a
     modified water cannon.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               You're sick, Doom.  Where do people
               like you come from?

                               DOOM
               Never mind where I come from.  Just
               watch where I'm going.

                               VALIANT
               Don't you think anyone's gonna notice
               that Toontown's gone?

                               DOOM
               They won't care.  Who's going to miss
               some ridiculous talking mice when they
               can have the future?


     EXT. BACK OF FACTORY - ROGER

     is trying to jimmy open a window using his whole body for
     leverage.  He finally pops the window open.  Gun drawn, he
     climbs over the sill.  And falls head first.


     INT. BATHROOM

     Roger splashes into the toilet bowl in the Acme washroom.  He
     bobs up.  He drains the water out of the pistol barrel and
     peeks over the bowl.  He gets a determined look in his eye.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               It's time to make my move.

     Roger starts to climb out of the toilet.  He reaches for
     something to grab onto.  Unwittingly, he gets the toilet
     chain hanging from the tank above.  As he pulls himself out,
     the toilet flushes.   Roger has only a moment to register a
     dumbfounded expression before he is sucked down the john.


     IN THE FACTORY - DOOM

     continues expansively.

                               DOOM
               Right here where we're standing, will
               be the cornerstone of my idea... the
               cloverleaf -- an elegant cement
               structure that intertwines freeways.

                               VALIANT
               What the hell's a freeway?

                               DOOM
               A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes
               of asphalt running uninterrupted from
               L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to
               Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica.
               Someday everyone will be in cars
               driving happily, non-stop from one end
               of the L.A. Basin to another.

                               VALIANT
               That's what this is all about?  Tell
               me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway?
               We got the Red Cars, the best public
               transportation in the country.

                               DOOM
               Not for long.  We're retiring the Red
               Cars.  People will drive, Mr. Valiant,
               because they'll have to.  And when they
               drive, they'll have to buy our cars,
               our tires, our gasoline.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Why'd you bother to call it a freeway?

     Doom steps up into their faces.  Behind him, several Weasles
     are fashioning a noose.

                               DOOM
               Has a nice ring.  Too bad you two won't
               be around to enjoy it.

     Suddenly Roger EXPLODES out of the drainage grate in the
     floor.  His entrance sends the Weasles flying.  Roger lands
     on his feet, James Cagney-like, levelling his gun on Judge
     Doom.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Get 'em up.  All of you!  Or I let the
               Judge have it!

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Roger, darling!

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Yes, it's me, my dearest.  I'd embrace
               you but first I have to take care of
               some unfinished business.

                               DOOM
               Put that gun down, you buck-toothed
               fool.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Go ahead.  Give me an excuse to fill
               you full of holes, pump you full of
               lead.
                      (over shoulder)
               How'm I doin', Eddie?

                               VALIANT
               Real good, Rog... but maybe you better
               let me take over.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Not before I satisfy my sense of moral
               outrage.

     Milking the moment, he shifts the gun from one hand to
     another.  He circles Doom, poking and prodding him with the
     gun.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               You think you could get away with this?
               Hah!  We Toons may be idiotic, but
               we're not stupid!


     POV OVERHEAD

     We LOOK DOWN on the proceedings from high in the rafters.
     PULL BACK TO REVEAL we're watching from the POV of Voltaire,
     who's perched on the top inventory rack.  Voltaire cleans his
     fingernails, casually.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Yes, justice, Judge Doom.  The real
               meaning of the word probably hits you
               like a ton of bricks!

     Voltaire calmly nudges an Acme Ton-Of-Bricks off the shelf.


     CLOSE - ROGER

     He never sees it coming.  SMASH!  The bricks land on his head
     and bury him.  The only thing we can see of Roger is his hand
     with the gun in it.

                               DOOM
               Well, this is turning out better than
               I thought.

     Doom picks the gun up.  The Weasles drag Roger out from under
     the bricks.  Big bright stars are circling his head.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (delirious)
               Look, stars!  Ready when you are,
               Raoul.

     Valiant shakes his head, but Jessica starts to laugh.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               I have missed you, Roger.

                               DOOM
               Tie the lovebirds together.

     The Weasles twirl Toon rope around Roger and Jessica like a
     cocoon.  They hook them on a power winch.  Then hit a button
     and raise Roger and Jessica until they're suspended fifteen
     feet above the floor... right in the path of the Dipmobile.

     Doom hands Valiant's gun to the head Weasle.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Let him watch his Toon friends get
               dipped...  then shoot him.

     Doom turns and starts to walk away.


     ANGLE ON GROUND

     He steps on a Toon banana peel and goes flat on his keester.


     THE WEASLES

     always quick with a laugh, BREAK UP at their boss'
     misfortune.  The one guarding Eddie is so overcome with
     LAUGHTER that he's slapping his thigh with his gun hand.
     Valiant sees his opportunity.  He starts to make a move
     toward the distracted Weasle and almost gets his hands on the
     gun when:

                               DOOM
               Watch out, you idiot... he's going for
               the gun!

     The Weasle turns at the last second, sticking the barrel up
     against Valiant's nose.  Doom gets to his feet.  He glowers
     at the Weasle and knocks him on the head with the gavel head
     of his cane.  Doom stalks out of the room.

     The Weasles scramble to positions on the Dipmobile.  One
     FIRES UP the ENGINE.

     The streetcleaner brushes start to turn.  The vehicle starts
     to creep forward.

     Another Weasle climbs into the turret.  He puts Roger and
     Jessica in the crosshairs of the cannon.

     Beads of sweat break out on Valiant's face.

     The Weasle, WHEEZING with evil glee, starts to press his
     finger to the trigger.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               You guys think this is real funny,
               doncha?
                      (to Valiant)
               Eddie, do somethin'!

     At the last second, Eddie shouts at the Weasle.

                               VALIANT
               Hey!

     The Weasle turns to him.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Before you pull the trigger, I want you
               to know somethin' about the guy you're
               about to dip.

     Suddenly, Eddie breaks into the "Looney Tooney Song".  The
     song Roger had sung in the bar.  The silly voice that comes
     out of his mouth surprises everybody, especially Roger.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing;
                       sings)
               'His name is Roger Rabbit
               He's got a crazy habit...'

     Valiant starts skulking across the floor.  It's a cross
     between Groucho Marx and a Chuck Berry Duck Walk.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing;
                       sings)
               'He likes to sing and dance and yuk
               So brighten up and smile you
                  schmuck...'

     Valiant starts "hoo-hooing", slapping himself in the
     forehead.  Now the Weasles start GIGGLING.  They've never
     seen a human do this before.

                               VALIANT
               'Now my name's Eddie V
               I'm looney too you'll see'

     Valiant flips into a handstand and starts walking on his
     hands.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               'I walk with my hands
               And I shake with my feet...'

     He offers his foot to a Weasle who shakes it.  The others
     HOWL.  Eddie flips upright and grabs a stick of Acme
     dynamite.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               'I think dynamite
               Is swell to eat'.

     Eddie takes a bite out of the Toon dynamite and acts like
     he's savoring it.  The spectacle of this human doing this is
     too much to bear.  Now the Weasles are rolling on the ground,
     holding their sides.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               He's lost his mind!

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Yeah, isn't it great?  Keep it up,
               Eddie... you're killing 'em, you're
               slayin' 'em, you're knockin' 'em dead.

     Roger means it.  The Weasles are laughing so hard they're
     giving themselves heart attacks.  Valiant spins around on the
     floor like a clock dial gone berserk.

                               VALIANT
               Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo...

     One by one, the Weasles keel over... dead.  Opaque WEASLE
     SPIRITS leave their bodies with wings and harps, and float
     heavenward, still laughing.


     VOLTAIRE

     alarmed at the scene below, grabs a brick and flaps toward
     the ceiling.  He throws the brick through the skylight and
     flies out.

                               VOLTAIRE
               Doom!  Doom!


     ON THE DIPMOBILE

     The Weasle on the turret collapses onto the trigger.  The
     unmanned dip cannon starts spraying, as the arm sweeps
     slowly back and forth like an, automatic lawn sprinkler.


     VALIANT

     hitches a ride on the last ascending Weasle Spirit, letting
     it hoist him to the top of the truck.  As he moves the Weasle
     body off the trigger...


     VOLTAIRE

     CRASHES back through the skylight and swoops down on Eddie.
     He sinks his talons into Eddie's back and lifts him into the
     air.

     As Valiant is being pulled skyward he reaches for something
     along the wall of inventory.  He grabs a handful of Acme
     Small Pills and jams a couple dowm the buzzard's mouth.
     Instantly, Voltaire starts to shrink.  As he gets smaller, he
     can no longer hold Eddie up.  They both descend as Voltaire
     shrinks to the size of a chick.

     The sprayer is swinging back towards Roger and Jessica.  At
     the last second, Valiant reaches up and blocks it.  It swings
     back the other way.

     As Valiant scrambles up on the vehicle to turn it off,
     Voltaire has found a box of Acme Big Pills.  He pecks into
     it... and after a beat, EXPLODES out of the box.  He's now
     three times the size he was before.  Voltaire flaps in for
     the kill.

     Valiant reaches the turret just in time to swing the cannon
     around.  The spray of dip blasts one of Voltaire's wings off.
     He spins earthward like a flaming Messerschmidt, finally
     landing in the dip vat and dissolving into a black pool.

     Doom arrives just in time to see his pet bird dissolved.
     Angrily, he steps onto a giant Acme Mousetrap.  He uses a
     piece of Acme cheese to spring it, catapulting him through
     the air.

     Just as Valiant is about to turn off the dip cannon, Doom
     lands on the truck.  He knocks Eddie off the turret with a
     flying tackle.  They both hit the floor.

     Doom gets up, leaving Eddie stunned.  He sprints to where the
     Weasle had dropped Eddie's pistol.  Finally Eddie shakes it
     off.  He sees Doom about to reach the gun.  He straps on a
     pair of Acme Rocket Skates, fires them up and shoots across
     the floor.  He knocks Doom into a stack of Acme boxes,
     toppling the whole shelf down on top of him.

     As the sprayer swings back toward Roger and Jessica, they
     have their last moment together.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Roger, I want you to know I love you.
               I loved you more than any woman has
               ever loved a rabbit.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Be comforted in the knowledge that as
               we face the Grim Dipper, our paint will
               be comingled for eternity.

     They both close their eyes, waiting for the end.  But it
     never cames.  The truck runs up on some boxes and the sprayer
     arm swings back the other way.

     Doom grabs an Acme slingshot, loads an Acme boulder and fires
     it at Valiant.  BLAM!  It whacks Valiant on the head, laying
     him out cold in front of the Cloverleaf steamroller,

     Doom climbs into the steamroller and starts it up.  He puts
     it into gear and starts it rolling toward Valiant.

     Valiant comes around to see the huge roller bearing down on
     him.  At the last second, Valiant rolls out of the way and
     grabs an Acme boxing glove.  It accordians out and smashes
     Doom in the face.  He goes flying out of the driver's seat,
     turning the wheel as he falls.  The steamroller starts to
     turn in circles.

     Valiant jumps Doom.  But Doom is stronger.  He throws Valiant
     off and starts whacking him with his fist.  He pummels
     Valiant backward toward the drum of the steamroller.  Valiant
     grabs the nearest thing for defense.  It's a can of Acme
     Stay-Put Adhesive.  He whips it up in front of his face.
     Doom puts his fist right through it, covering his hand with
     glue.  He smiles at Valiant and hauls off again.  Valiant
     ducks.  Doom's fist strikes the top of the drum of the
     steamroller.  Frantically he tries to pull it off.  But it
     "Stays-Put".  The roller starts to suck his fist down and
     under.

                               DOOM
               Nooooo!

     Jessica and Roger avert their eyes as the steamroller crushes
     Doom.

     Valiant breathes a sigh of relief.  He starts for the dip
     truck as the cannon swings back toward Roger and Jessica.
     But neither of them are watching the cannon.  Their eyes are
     fixed on the ground behind the steamroller.


     ANGLE ON GROUND

     There isn't the messy pile of blood and guts you'd expect to
     see if a human got run over.  Instead, we see that Judge
     Doom's remains have rolled out like a flat black pancake.
     After a beat, an edge curls up with a CREAK.  Now the whole
     shape peels off the floor and wobbles to it's feet. REVEALING
     DOOM IS A TOON.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Eddie, look out!


     VALIANT

     turns to see Doom stick his flattened thumb in his mouth.  He
     blows, re-inflating himself.  His glasses CRACK and fall off.
     Then his prosthetic eyeballs pop out.  His teeth shatter and
     fall out of his mouth like china.  Underneath his latex mask
     we can see his Toon mouth and evil red Toon eyes.

                               VALIANT
               Holy shit, he's a Toon!

                               DOOM
               Surprised?

                               VALIANT
               Not really.  Only a Toon could think of
               something as goofy as that freeway
               idea.

     Doom takes the black rubber gloves off, REVEALING red hands
     with long fingernails.  He makes his fist into an anvil and
     advances on Valiant.

                               DOOM
               Is that so?  Well, we'll see who's the
               goofy one.

     BLAM!  From ten feet away, he smashes Valiant with a
     bone-crushing punch.  Valiant staggers backwards.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               By the way, when I killed your brother,
               Teddy, I used to talk just like this.

     Doom spesks in a Toony high-pitched squeak.  Valiant
     recognizes him now.

                               VALIANT
               You?

                               DOOM
               That's right, me.

     BLAM!  Doom hammers Valiant again.  He's defenseless against
     Doom's super human strength.  BLAM!  Valiant goes
     sprawling to the ground.  Now Doom's hand turns into a
     buzzsaw.  He goes to administer the coup de grace.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Now Eddie's gonna be deady, just like
               Teddy.

     With his last ounce of strength, Valiant grabs the Acme
     Boxing Glove.  He pops it.  The glove extends across the
     room, punching the release lever on the dip truck.


     CLOSE - VALVE

     A flood of dip gushes out of the valve and rolls toward Doom
     like a wave.


     DOOM

     SCREAMS as the torrent hits him with a CRASH.  But there's no
     escape for him this time.  The flood of liquid envelopes him
     at the ankles.  He dissolves into it like a melting candle.


     THE DIPMOBILE

     continues forward inexorably.  The arm is swinging towards
     Roger and Jessica.  It gets closer and closer...

     Valiant tries to get to the truck, but it's too late.  The
     cannon has reached them.


     CLOSE - ROGER AND JESSICA

     They close their eyes, preparing to meet their Maker.  But
     nothing happens.

     The spray of the cannon suddenly peters out.  It dries up in
     a harmless drip as the tank has completely emptied.

     Valiant gets to the controls of the power winch.  He hoists
     Roger and Jessica up out of the way.  The Dipmobile passes
     harmlessly underneath them and SMASHES through the brick
     wall.


     TOONTOWN

     is REVEALED in all its splendor.  It's a bucolic setting.  A
     rainbow shares the blue sky with a smiling sun.  Fawns and
     butterflies, chipmunks and flowers watch curiously as the dip
     truck rolls past.  Suddenly it's lifted off the ground.  We
     see it's resting on the top of a TOON GIANT's head.  This
     Giant plucks the truck off his head, regards it, then pops it
     in his mouth.


     VALIANT

     lowers Roger and Jessica to the ground.  We HEAR POLICE
     SIRENS approach.  When Valiant unties them, Jessica turns and
     exclaims...

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               My hero!

     Then she hugs Roger passionately.  Valiant can only shrug.


     THROUGH THE WALL - TOONS

     start coming in.  They look around at the scene, bewildered,
     then gather around Doom's robe, mask and shoes lying in the
     puddle of dip.  There's a reddish slick floating on top.
     Valiant wanders over and joins them.

                               VALIANT
               Hi-ho, the Doom is dead.


     ANGLE ON DOOR

     Dolores, Lt. Santino, and several other COPS rush in, guns
     drawn.  Dolores runs to Eddie and puts her arms around him.
     Santino looks down at the remains on the floor.

                               LT. SANTINO
               What the hell is that?

                               VALIANT
               Doom.

                               LT. SANTINO
               Jesus Christ... that was the Judge?

     Valiant takes the paint chip out of his pocket.  He puts it
     up against the red slime on the robe.  It's a match.

                               VALIANT
               That was the murderer of Herman Acme,
               Maroon... and my brother.

     Dolores looks down at the front of Valiant's shirt.  A dark
     stain is appearing.

                               DOLORES
               Eddie, we better get you to hospital.
               You're bleedin'.

     Valiant looks down at the stain.

                               VALIANT
               That's not blood.  That's ink.  That
               goof Acme squirted me with some the
               other day.  Why it's comin' 'through
               now, I don't know.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               That's because it's
               Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up
               three days later.  Gives you enough
               time to get away from the victim so he
               doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great
               gag.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah...

                               DOLORES
               I'll treat you to a new shirt.  After
               all, you did save Toontown.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Problem is without Marvin's will, the
               land still goes to Cloverleaf.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               That's right.  If only we knew what
               happened to that will...

     Valiant looks up from his shirt.

                               VALIANT
               Say Roger, remember that love letter
               you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint
               Club?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Yeah?

                               VALIANT
               I think you oughta read it to her.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Good idea.

     He reaches in his pocket, pulls out the paper and clears his
     throat.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing;
                       reads)
               Dear Jessy... How do I love thee?  Let
               me count the... I, Marvin Acme, of
               sound mind and body... Hey?


     CLOSE - PAPER

     The Disappearing-Reappearing Ink is coming up over Roger's
     scribbling.

                               VALIANT
               Keep reading...

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (reads)
               Hey, it's the will.  I, Marvin Acme, of
               sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo,
               do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the
               property known as Toontown to those
               loveable characters...

     PAN the Toon crowd, who are listening to the reading of the
     will.  It is a gallery of recognizable faces.  Everyone from
     Mickey to Bugs, Yakky Doodle to Yosemite Sam, Dumbo to Dopey,
     Bambi to Droopy, Tweety Bird to Tinkerbell.  They're all
     there.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               ... who have given me and the rest of
               humanity so much mirth and merriment...
               the Toons.

     The Toon crowd erupts with a CHEER!  Hats go in the air and
     they descend on Roger, slapping his back.  Roger breaks away
     from the crowd and joins Eddie.


     TWO SHOT - EDDIE AND ROGER

     They stand side by side, looking out over Toontown.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well, Eddie, you still think I'm a
               patsy, a simp, a chump?

     Eddie wipes the spit off his face.

                               VALIANT
               No, kid, you're a real hero.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I guess I am at that.  Cigar?

     Roger holds out a large stogie.

                               VALIANT
               Why not?

     Roger lights Eddie's and one for himself.

                               VALIANT
                       (continuing)
               By the way, Roger, you were right about
               your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm
               glad you got her back.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               And I'm glad you got your sense of
               humor back.  Think you'll keep it?

                               VALIANT
               Only time will tell.

     Valiant puffs on the cigar.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               From this box here...

     Valiant glances down.  The box says, "Acme Exploding Cigars".
     He looks to Roger, but it's too late.  KABOOM!  KABOOM!
     Their cigars blow up in classic Toon tradition, blackening
     both their faces.  Roger starts laughing.  Eddie stares at
     Roger for a moment, then he starts laughing too.  They throw
     their heads back in a HOWL.  The other Toons join in.  Pretty
     soon the whole factory is shaking with LAUGHTER.


     A TOON COP

     dressed in blue uniform and hat with his back to us tries to
     restore order in the Acme factory.  As soon as he talks, we
     recognize the stutter.  It's PORKY PIG.

                               PORKY PIG
               O-k-k-k, mmmove along.  There's
               nnnothin' else to see.  T-t-that's it.
               T-t-that's all, folks.
                      (turns to
                       CAMERA)
               Hmm, I l-l-like the sound of that.

     Then, savoring the phrase, Porky stutters out the famous
     sign-off.

                               PORKY PIG
                      (continuing)
                Eee-ba-da, eee-ba-da... t-t-that's all,
                folks!

     CARTOON MUSIC UP.

                                                THIRD DRAFT

                                                September 2, 1986









                        WHO SHOT ROGER RABBIT?

     This movie starts the way all movies should... with a
     cartoon.  It's not a Disney or a Warner's.  It's not a
     Fleischer, an MGM, or a Lanz.  This is a lesser known
     studio.


     FADE IN:

     ON A "MAROON CARTOON"

     Accompanied by zany CARTOON MUSIC, the TITLE CARD reads:

                   MAROON CARTOONS PRESENT
                BABY HERMAN AND ROGER RABBIT
                           IN
                      "THE BUNNYSITTER"

     Below are two cameos of the cartoon's stars.  One picture is
     of a cherubic baby in a bonnet innocently posed with his
     thumb in his mouth.  The other is of a paunchy rabbit with a
     gap between his front teeth.  He has a loveable, if slightly
     shell-shocked look.  The cartoon begins...


     BABY HERMAN AND ROGER RABBIT

     are in a playpen when TWO FEMALE LEGS in high heels walk INTO
     FRAME.  The VOICE belonging to the legs talks down to Baby
     Herman in a maternal coo.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
               Mommy's going to the beauty parlor,
               darling.  But I'm leaving you with your
               favorite friend, Roger.  He's going to
               take very, very good care of you...
                      (voice turns
                       ominous)
               ... cause if he doesn't, he's going
               back to the science lab!

     Roger gulps as he watches the legs disappear.  We HEAR
     FOOTSTEPS recede and a DOOR SLAM.  Roger turns confidently
     back to his charge.  But the little tyke is already squeezing
     through the playpen bars.

                               BABY HERMAN
               Baby bye-bye...

     Roger makes a dive for him, misses, and gets his head stuck
     between the bars.  He pleads with the Baby in a voice that
     resonates of Huntz Hall in "The Bowery Boys".

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hey, come back!  You heard what your
               mother said!


     BABY HERMAN

     ignores Roger.  We FOLLOW HIM as he crawls into the kitchen.
     He stops to regard something that has caught his attention...
     a cookie jar.  It's sitting on top of the refrigerator.

                               BABY HERMAN
               Coo-kie.


     ROGER

     wearing the playpen like a pillory, comes running toward the
     kitchen.  But the playpen is too wide to clear the door.  The
     impact SHATTERING the playpen and sends Roger sprawling
     across the kitchen floor.  When he looks up...


     BABY HERMAN

     is swinging precariously on the door of the freeer.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hang on, Baby.  I'll save you!

     Roger makes a desperate leap across the kitchen for the kid.
     But Baby Herman swings the door to the freezer open and Roger
     disappears inside.  Baby Herman grabs a cookie and swings
     back, shutting the door.  He climbs down and crawls out of
     the kitchen.  After a beat, the freezer door opens.


     ROGER

     now shaped like a block of ice, falls out and hits the floor.
     The block SHATTERS into ice cubes.  Roger looks around,
     dazed.


     BABY HERMAN

     has taken this opportunity to crawl out the window.  Roger
     races to the window.  His eyes pop out of his head at what he
     sees.


     ROGER'S POV

     Baby Herman is crawling along the sidewalk under the shadow
     of a safe being hoisted into a second floor window by the
     Acme Safe Moving Company.  The rope holding the safe is
     fraying down to a slender thread.


     ROGER

     gasps and rockets out the window toward Baby Herman.  The
     rope snaps.  The safe falls.  Roger arrives just in time to
     pluck the Baby out of harm's way.  But not in time to save
     himself.  The safe CRUNCHES down on his head, burying Roger
     into the sidewalk.  After a beat, Roger's hand appears and
     spins the tumbler.  The safe door opens.  Inside, we see the
     dazed rabbit with little TWEETING BIRDS circling his head.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
               Cut, cut, cut!

     The cartoon action stops abruptly, but the goofy CARTOON
     MUSIC PLAYS ON.  We begin a slow PULL BACK TO REVEAL that
     this cartoon is being filmed LIVE ON A SOUND STAGE.  The
     title card sits on an easle.  The female legs are paper
     mache' props manipulated by two HUMAN CREW MEMBERS.  Wearily,
     they lean the legs up against the stage wall.  A human
     DIRECTOR, wearing a tweed jacket and baggy pleated pants,
     steps onto the set.  From the equipment and the dress of the
     crew, we can tell it's the 1940's.  Baby Herman throws his
     cookie down in disgust.  He talks in a gravelly voice an
     octave lower than Wallace Beery's.

                               BABY HERMAN
               What the hell was wrong with that
               take??

                               DIRECTOR
               Nothin' with you, Baby Herman.  It's on
               Roger... again!
                      (over shoulder)
               Hey!  Could we lose the playback?

     The MUSIC suddenly STOPS as, off to the side, the SOUNDMAN
     lifts the needle off a phonograph record.  The Director leans
     over Roger and angrily plucks one of the birds circling his
     head.

                               DIRECTOR
                      (continuing)
               What's this, Roger?

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (sheepish)
               A tweeting bird?

                               DIRECTOR
               That's right, a tweeting bird.  But
               what does the script say?  'Rabbit gets
               conked.  Rabbit sees stars!'  Not
               birds, stars!

                               BABY HERMAN
               Aw, for cryin' out loud, Roger!  I'll
               be in my trailer... takin' a nap!

     Baby Herman pulls himself up to his full height of two feet
     and walks off the set.  He chooses a route that takes him
     under the dress of the SCRIPT GIRL.  She jumps as if goosed.
     Now two CREW MEMBERS lift the safe off Roger.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars,
               I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my
               head one more time.

                               DIRECTOR
               I've already dropped it on you
               twenty-three times.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Don't worry about me.  I can take it.

                               DIRECTOR
               I'm not worried about you.  I'm worried
               about the safe.

     CONTINUED PULLBACK.

     What we've been seeing has been from the POV of a MAN in a
     shiny brown suit standing unobtrusively at the back of the
     sound stage.  Under a beat-up fedora is a craggy face that's
     seen a lot in its life... but apparently didn't think much of
     it was funny.  EDDIE VALIANT takes a jolt from a pint of
     whiskey, evidently in reaction to what he's seen.  He opens
     his coat and returns the pint bottle to a shoulder holster
     which had formerly held a .38.  Nerves steadied, he walks out
     the stage door.


     EXT. MAROON STUDIO - DAY

     Valiant emerges from the stage onto a bustling Hollywood
     studio lot where CARTOON CHARACTERS (TOONS) and humans are
     comingling as if it were the most natural thing in the world.
     Valiant stops by an Acme Novelty truck which is unloading
     Toon props.  There are bombs, rockets, flattened pocket
     watches, anvils, giant slingshots, etcetera.  The license
     plate is California 1946.  He fishes out a pack of
     Chesterfields and taps out a half a butt that had been
     stubbed out.  As he lights it, Valiant regards a chubby,
     balding man wearing a three-piece suit and a worried
     expression coming towards him.  He is R.K. MAROON, studio
     boss.  Maroon is leading an entourage of ASSISTANTS trying to
     keep up.

                               MAROON
               Starting tomorrow there'll be no more
               roast beef lunches.  What happened to
               cheese sandwiches?  I was raised on
               cheese sandwiches.

     As the Assistants dutifully record his thoughts, Maroon sees
     a GUY taking a nap in the shade of a palm tree.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               And tell that guy sleepin' over there
               he's fired!
 
                               ASSISTANT
               It's your wife's brother, R.K.

                               MAROON
                      (reconsiders)
               Oh... tell him he's promoted.  But get
               him out of my sight.

     As the Assistants disperse, Maroon approaches Valiant.

                               MAROON
               Valiant, did you see the rabbit?

                               VALIANT
               He was blowin' his lines, all right.
               So what?

                               MAROON
               So what?  He's already put me three
               weeks behind on the shooting schedule!

     Now an EDITH HEAD-TYPE hustles up to show Maroon several
     costume designs.

                               COSTUMER
               Your reaction, R.K.?

     Maroon quickly checks out the drawing.

                               MAROON
               No!  That's not funny.
 
     She flips another drawing.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               That's funny.  Put a homburg on him
               it'll even be funnier.  Huh, Valiant?

     He grabs the pad and shows Valiant.  The rendering is of a
     hippo in a pink polka-dot tu-tu.

                               VALIANT
                      (deadpan)
               Yeah, that'd be a riot.

     Maroon responds to Valiant's sarcasm with raised eyebrows.

                               MAROON
               Boy, I hope what you have ain't
               contagious or I'll be out of business.

     He hands the pad back to the designer, who departs.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               How much do you know about show
               business, Valiant?

                               VALIANT
               Only there's no business like it, no
               business I know.

     Valiant watches an ALLIGATOR in a rebel uniform dragging a
     brace of cannons and several TOADSTOOLS parade by.

                               MAROON
               Yeah, and there's no business as
               expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over
               budget on the latest Bunnysitter
               cartoon and it's all because that
               rabbit can't keep his mind on his work.
               And you know why?

                               VALIANT
               One too many safes dropped on his head?

                               MAROON
               Nah, that goes with the territory.
               He's a stunt bunny.

     Maroon takes a copy of the "Hollywood Tattler" out of his
     pocket.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               Here's the problem...
                      (reads)
               "Seen cooing over calamari with
               notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica
               Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger".
                      (looks up)
               His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's
               Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him
               up.

                               VALIANT
               So what do you want me to do?

                               MAROON
               Get me a couple juicy pictures.
               Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up
               with.

                               VALIANT
               I don't work in Toontown.

                               MAROON
               You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife
               sings at an underground Toon revue
               joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You
               can catch her in action there.

                               VALIANT
               The job's gonna cost you a hundred
               bucks.

                               MAROON
               A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.

                               VALIANT
               So's the job.

     Valiant starts to walk away.

                               MAROON
               All right, all right... You got your
               hundred bucks.

     Maroon turns, snaps his fingers.  His Assistant appears out
     of nowhere with Maroon's checkbook and a pen.  The Assistant
     turns and stoops so that Maroon can write the check on his
     back.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               Fifty now, fifty when you deliver the
               pictures.

     Maroon tears the check off and hands it to Valiant.  Suddenly
     Valiant ducks in reflex to a large shadow that passes
     overhead.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing;
                       chuckles)
               Kinda jumpy aren't you, Valiant?  It's
               just Dumbo.


     ABOVE THEIR HEADS - DUMBO

     swoops back and forth, then hovers, ears flapping like a
     hummingbird.

                               MAROON
               I got him on loan from Disney.

                               VALIANT
               Aren't you the lucky one...

     Valiant grabs the check from Maroon and starts for the gate.

                               MAROON
               When will I hear from you?

                               VALIANT
               As soon as is humanly possible.

     We FOLLOW Valiant out the gate under a wrought iron sign that
     reads "Maroon Cartoon Studios".  As he starts across the road
     he's almost run over by a Toon roadster that ROARS out of the
     gates.  When it BLASTS ITS HORN, it's the FIRST FIVE NOTES
     from the WOODY WOODPECKER SONG:  "HA-HA-HA-HA-HA".  Valiant
     jumps back as the roadster passes.  WOODY THE WOODPECKER'S
     behind the wheel with a self-important smile on his face.
     Valiant angrily waves the cloud of Toon dust away.

                               VALIANT
                      (coughs)
               Damn Toons.


     ACROSS THE STREET - A TROLLEY CAR

     is slowing to a stop in front of the studio.  It's a Pacific
     and Electric "Red Car", part of a vast system of electric
     trollies that once criss-crossed the L.A. Basin.  Valiant
     steps onto the "Red Car".  He reaches into his pocket to give
     the CONDUCTOR his nickel fare.  But he comes up with a
     handful of lint.  He holds out the check.

                               CONDUCTOR
               What do I look like, a bank?

     The Conductor jerks his thumb toward the door.  Valiant
     suffers the public humiliation,of having to step down past
     the rest of the boarding passengers.  He walks around to the
     back of the Red Car where a gang of TEN-YEAR-OLDS are
     loitering.  When the BELL SOUNDS and the Red Car starts to
     pull away, the Kids make a dash for a place on the cow
     catcher.  Valiant joins them.  We HOLD as the Red Car moves
     away and the street urchins regard their older partner in
     crime with curiosity.

                                              DISSOLVE TO:


     A BILLBOARD SIGN

     It reads:  "L.A.'s Pacific and Electric Red Car -- America's
     Finest Public Transportation System".  PAN DOWN to see that
     the sign is on the roof of the trolley terminal.  Red Cars
     are going in and out of the shed.  MOVE IN on one car
     approaching the terminal from down the street.  As it passes
     by...


     VALIANT

     hops off his freeloader's seat on the back,

                               KID
               So long, mister.

     Valiant waves laconically.

                               VALIANT
               Thanks for the cigarettes.

     We FOLLOW Valiant as he crosses the street to a seedy
     bungalow.  A note is push-pinned to the door.


     CLOSE - NOTE

     It says:  "Tomorrow's Friday... Well?  Dolores".


     VALIANT

     takes the note and walks back across the street toward the
     terminal.  He climbs up a flight of stairs, heading for a bar
     on the mezzanine.  The bar sports a red neon sign that used
     to blink, "The Terminal Station Bar".  But now it just says,
     "Terminal".


     INT. TERMINAL BAR - DAY

     The place must have been pretty swanky at the turn of the
     century when it was built in the first burst of enthusiasm
     over the new public transportation system.  It's in the motif
     of a trolley car.  There's a large map on the wail above the
     bar showing all the different lines.  Behind the bar is
     DOLORES.  If you scraped off all the makeup, you'd find an
     attractive woman in her late thirties.  She ministers to a
     rag-tag assortment of Hollywood low-lifes -- who are truly at
     the end of the line.


     VALIANT

     enters this den, lets his eyes adjust for a moment, then
     bellies up to the bar.  He finds a spot between a ONE-ARMED
     BLACK SOLDIER and a MIDGET stretched out on the bar passed
     out.  Now a TROLLEY RUMBLES underneath them.  The bar starts
     to shake like an earthquake, the lights flicker.  All the
     drinkers, observing a time honored ritual, lift their glasses
     simultaneously to avoid spilling any drops.  Even the Midget
     lifts his head until the trolley has passed.  Valiant reaches
     over the bar and blind-grabs a bottle of rye he obviously
     knows is there.  He pours himself a shot.

                               VALIANT
               Hey, fellas, what's the good word?

                               SOLDIER
               Lost my job.

     An ARTHRITIC COWBOY pipes up.

                               COWBOY
               Mule died.

     A DEAF-MUTE scribbles a note on a pad hanging around his
     neck.  He hands the note to Valiant.  It says "My girl dumped
     me".  Valiant pats him on the back, consoling.

                               VALIANT
               Well, you know what they say about
               dames, Augie...

     Then Valiant mouths the rest of it for Augie's benefit only.
     Augie reads his lips, then starts to roar silently, slapping
     his thigh.  Now Dolores makes her way down the bar.  She
     grabs the Midget by the suspenders and slides him out of the
     way.

                               DOLORES
               So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie?
               Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a
               dame who took a hundred bucks out of
               the till so your landlord would't
               throw you out of your dump.  And it was
               a dame who trusted you for the money
               when no one else in town would.  And
               it's a dame who's tired of waitin' for
               you to straighten yourself out and get
               a job!

                               VALIANT
               Would this be the same dame who's going
               to feel awfully foolish when she finds
               out I've got her money.

     Valiant slides the check across the bar.  Dolores studies it.
     She calms down a little.

                               DOLORES
               This is fifty bucks.  I need
               seventy-five before they check the
               books tomorrow.

                               VALIANT
               You'll have it in the morning.  Now be
               a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to
               put in my pocket.

                               DOLORES
               Is this paper even good?

                               VALIANT
               Check the scrawl.

                               DOLORES
                      (reads)
               R.K. Maroon.

     Now ANGELO, a Neanderthal sitting a few stools down, is
     tapping the shell of a hardboiled egg.

                               ANGELO
               Maroon?  Valiant, don't tell me you're
               workin' for a Toon?  Who's your client?
               Chilly Willy or Screwy Squirrel?

     Angelo chuckles at his own joke and goes to eat his egg.
     Suddenly Valiant darkens.  He grabs Angelo by the shirt and
     pulls him up to his face.

                               VALIANT
               Get this straight, greaseball.  I'm not
               workin' for a Toon!  I'd never work for
               a Toon!  Got that?

     Valiant jams the whole egg into Angelo's mouth, turns and
     storms out the door.  Angelo sputters and spits out the egg.

                               ANGELO
               What's his problem?

                               DOLORES
               Toon killed his brother.


     EXT. INK & PAINT CLUB - NIGHT

     Valiant knocks on the door of, a non-descript building in a
     run-down factory area.  A speakeasy style peephole slides
     open REVEALING the face of a TOON GORILLA.  Valiant offers
     the password.

                               VALIANT
               Walt sent me.

     The peephole slides closed and after a beat the door swings
     open.


     INT. CLUB

     The Gorilla, dressed in a tux, gives Valiant the once over.
     Valiant resents the assessment.

                               VALIANT
               Like your monkey suit.

                               GORILLA
               Wise ass...

     We FOLLOW Valiant down the hall toward the main room.  We can
     HEAR LAUGHTER and ZANY MUSIC from within.


     INT. MAIN ROOM

     When Valiant steps through the doorway, we see the place is
     no dive.  It's a white tablecloth nightclub on a par with the
     El Morroco or the Garden of Allah.  Behind the bar A
     CATERPILLAR BARTENDER is using his many arms to shake and
     pour several drinks at once.  Meanwhile a dozen PENGUIN
     WAITERS are gliding back and forth along the tables serving
     drinks to the well-heeled crowd.


     ON STAGE

     DONALD DUCK and DAFFY DUCK are seated opposite each other at
     matching grand pianos.  What begins as a decorous Duck duet
     on a Tchaikovsky piece (complete with knuckle-cracking,
     seat-spinning preparations) quickly accelerates to a loony
     game of one-upsmanship between these two irascible Ducks.
     There is keyboard stomping, lid-banging, piano wire plucking
     zaniness.


     THE AUDIENCE

     is HOWLING.  People are wiping the tears from their eyes
     they're laughing so hard.  All except...


     VALIANT

     He lights a cigarette impassively, not humored by the Toon
     hijinx.  He spots an empty table off to the side and makes
     his way towards it.  A SILLY GEEZER in a loud suit is at the
     next table.  The Geezer nods to him soberly as Valiant pulls
     Out the chair and sits down.  A LOUD FLATULENCE SOUND erupts
     from under Valiant.  The Geezer slaps his thigh with the
     hilarity of it all.

                               GEEZER
               Will you listen to that?  It's a pip!
               I'm thinking of callin' it a Whoopee
               Cushion.

     Valiant reaches under himself and comes up holding a deflated
     rubber bladder.  The Geezer retrieves it from him.

                               GEEZER
                       (continuing)
                No hard feelings, I hope.  Put 'er
                there...

     The Geezer grabs Valiant's hand before he can say no.  We
     HEAR A BUZZ.  Valiant retracts his hand as if shocked.  The
     Geezer howls with laughter and turns his palm to Eddie.

                               GEEZER
                      (continuing)
               Hand buzzer... real gasser.

     Valiant rolls his eyes and grabs a Penguin as it glides by.

                               VALIANT
               Scotch.

                               PENGUIN
               There's a two drink minimum.

                               VALIANT
               Just as long as there's no maximum.

                               GEEZER
               Waiter, I'll sign my check now.

     The Penguin puts a bill down on the Geezer's table and zips
     off.  The Geezer takes a fountain pen out of his jacket and
     writes on the bill.  But there doesn't seem to be any ink
     coming out.  He shakes and shakes the pen to get it flowing.
     It flows all right.  Ink splatters all over Valiant's shirt
     and pants.  Valiant looks down at the stain, doing a slow
     burn.  The Geezer starts laughing.  Valiant jumps up and
     grabs him by the lapels.

                               VALIANT
               That's it for you, pops!

                               GEEZER
                      (freaked)
               Calm down, son.  Look, the ink is gone.

     Valiant looks down at his shirt.  The stain is gone.

                               GEEZER
                      (continuing)
               See?  It disappears.

                               VALIANT
               Well, why don't you make like the ink?

     Valiant drops him into his chair and returns to his seat.
     The Penguin glides up with his drinks.  Valiant swallows the
     first one with one quick jerk of the head.


     ON STAGE

     Donald and Daffy's PIANO COMPETITION has reached a CRESCENDO
     of mayhem.  They've got the axes out, and in time with the
     MUSIC they reduce their pianos to matchsticks.  At the
     completion of the piece, they step to the front of the stage
     and with great decorum, arms around each other, they take
     their bows.  The curtain comes down to GREAT APPLAUSE.  We
     HEAR SFX of CRASHING AND BASHING backstage.  Now from behind
     Valiant, we HEAR a familiar high-pitched VOICE.

                               CIGARETTE GIRL
               Cigars... cigarettes... Eddie?

     Valiant turns to see BETTY BOOP standing with a box of
     tobacco wares strapped around her neck.  In contrast to all
     the other Toons, Betty's in black and white.

                               BETTY BOOP
                      (continuing)
               Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We
               miss you in Toontown.

                               VALIANT
               Wish I could say the same.  What're you
               doin' here, Betty?

                               BETTY BOOP
               Work's been slow for me since the
               cartoons went to color.  But I still
               got it, Eddie...
                      (sings)
               'Boop boop be-doop'.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, you still got it, Betty.
                      (indicates
                       Geezer)
               Who's Mr. Jocularity?

                               BETTY BOOP
                      (leans in)
               That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.

                               VALIANT
               Shoulda guessed.

                               BETTY BOOP
               He comes here every night to see
               Jessica Rabbit.

                               VALIANT
               Big on the musical comedy, huh?

                               BETTY BOOP
               Sounds like you ve never seen her,
               Eddie.

     Now the lights dim and Betty moves on.


     ON STAGE

     the dour DROOPY walks out with the spotlight following him.
     He's the evening's emcee.

                               DROOPY
                      (deadpan)
               Hello, everybody.  I hope you're all
               having as much fun as I am.  I have a
               small announcement to make.  Jessica
               Rabbit will not be able to sing
               tonight.

     There's a ROAR OF DISAPPROVAL from the men in the crowd.
     They shower him with debris.

                               DROOPY
                      (continuing;
                       deadpan)
               I was merely jesting.  Without further
               ado... here's woman times two,
               Toontown's own chanteuse par
               excellance... Jessica Rabbit!

     There is excited APPLAUSE as the lights dim. A TOON COMBO
     made up of CROWS in shades STRIKES UP the intro to the smokey
     song, "Why Don't You Do Right".  A spotlight hits the
     curtain. Now a curvaceous leg pokes out, teasingly.  The
     crowd goes wild as the rest of the body belonging to the leg
     emerges.  JESSICA RABBIT is a generously endowed red-headed
     bombshell.  She's a humanoid Toon... in her case, more
     beautiful than human.  Her figure is testimony to what a guy
     can do with a pencil and a fertile imagination,


     REACTION - VALIANT

     This is not quite the bunny he expected Roger to be married
     to.  His jaw drops.  And his reaction is mirrored all around
     the room.  The men are panting so hard you couldn't keep a
     match lit.


     CLOSEUP - JESSICA

     as she steps to the mike.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (sings)
               'You had plenty of money back
                  in '22
               You let other woman make a fool
                  of you
               Why don't you do right.
               Like some other men do...
               Get out of here and
               Get me the money too...'

     Jessica takes the mike and comes off the stage.  Slinkily.
     she wanders among the tables, teasing the men as she goes.

     Now there's a HOWL from behind Valiant.  A Tex Avery type
     TOON WOLF, who came masquerading as a human, couldn't help
     but show his true colors at the sight of Jessica.  He HOWLS
     as if it were a full moon.  His tongue rolls out of his head
     and piles up on the floor like so much clothesline.  His
     eyeballs telescope out of his head.  And finally, the Wolf
     levitates and snaps rigid like an open jacknife.  As the Wolf
     makes a rush for the stage, the Gorilla Bouncer grabs him by
     the suspenders.  The Wolf, legs spinning madly, practically
     knocks Valiant's table over as he grabs at Jessica.  But the
     Wolf has come to the end of his suspenders.  He snaps back
     toward the Gorilla who is holding an anvil in front of the
     suspenders.  CLANG!  The Wolf hits the anvil and slides to
     the floor.  The Gorilla calmly whisks him into a dustpan and
     carries him out.


     JESSICA

     like all good saloon singers, has continued her act
     undaunted.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (singing)
               'Why don't you do right.
               Like some other men do...'

     She sashays over to the Geezer's table.  Teasingly, she
     swirls the whisps of white hair onto his head into a Dairy
     Queen.  He giggles gleefully and makes a grab at Jessica.
     But she slips out of his grasp like mercury.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               'You ain't got no money
               Ain't got no use for you...'

     Now Jessica works her way over to Eddie.  She stops at his
     table and sings tauntingly.  Then with a flourish, she throws
     herself in his lap, and belts out the finale.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               'So get out of here...
               And get me the money toooo!'

     There is RAUCOUS APPLAUSE when she finishes.  Jessica looks
     deep into Eddie's eyes.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               Thanks for your lap.

     Before Eddie can reply, she jumps off, and slinks offstage,
     leaving Eddie a pile of human wreckage.  Valiant slugs the
     rest of his drink down to put out the fire in his libido.

     When the lights come up, Valiant looks over to where Acme is
     slicking down his eyebrows and patting his hair down.  He
     stands, picks up a bouquet of roses from the chair beside
     him, and as he passes Valiant's table, gives him a big wink.
     Valiant watches Acme disappear backstage.  He stands, drops
     a couple bucks on the table, and follows after him.


     BACKSTAGE

     Valiant steps past the curtain, keeping a discreet distance.
     He follows Marvin Acme down a corridor and around the corner.
     Acme stops and knocks on a dressing room door.  After a
     moment, it opens and Acme goes inside.  Valiant checks over
     his shoulder, but the backstage area is empty.  He eases over
     to the door and puts his eye to the keyhole.


     POV THROUGH KEYHOLE

     Jessica is seated at her dressing table.  Acme is on his
     knees next to her, kissing his way up her gloved hand, eyes
     closed in ecstasy.  Jessica takes her hand out of the glove
     and starts combing her hair, leaving Marvin kissing a
     suspended Toon glove.


     ANGLE ON VALIANT

     while he continues his peeping.  The Gorilla bouncer sneaks
     up behind him.

                               GORILLA
               Hey, whaddaya think you're doin',
               chump?

                               VALIANT
               Who're you callin' chump, chimp?

     The Gorilla smiles sadistically when he recognizes Valiant.

                               GORILLA
               Oh, it's da comedian...

     The Gorilla grabs Valiant by the belt and lifts him off the
     ground.  He opens the fire door and heaves Valiant out.


     EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

     Valiant comes flying out the door and CRASHES into a bunch of
     garbage cans in the alley.  The Gorilla stands in the doorvay
     regarding the dazed Valiant.

                               GORILLA
               And don't lemme catch your peepin' face
               around here again.  Got it?

                               VALIANT
               Ooga-booga.

     The Gorilla slams the door.  Valiant picks himself up out of
     the garbage.  He brushes himself off, then starts down the
     alley toward the rear of the building.  We FOLLOW him around
     the corner where he stops under Jessica's dressing room
     window.  He drags over a milk crate to stand on, takes a
     small camera out of his pocket and opens the bellows.  He
     stands on the crate and aims the camera through the corner of
     the window, as we HEAR the MUFFLED CONVERSATION from within.

                               ACME (O.S.)
               Are we going to play pattycake tonight?

                               JESSICA RABBIT (0.5.)
               Marvin, I have a headache...

                               ACME (O.S.)
                      (hurt)
               But you promised...

                               JESSICA RABBIT (O.S.)
               Oh, all right.  But this time take that
               hand buzzer off...

     Valiant's eyes widen in disgust.

                               VALIANT
               Jesus Christ...

     As he starts CLICKING pictures...

                                              CUT TO:


     EXT. MAROON STUDIO - LATE NIGHT

     There's one light on in the Administration building.


     INT. MAROON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     It's a large art deco office with walls covered with photos
     of Maroon and various celebrities, human and Toon.  R.K.
     Maroon is seated behind his desk.  Standing nearby is
     Valiant.  They are both regarding a hysterical Roger Rabbit,
     who's holding a set of 8 x lO glossies.  He's WAILING and
     CRYING, Toon tears flooding off him in a torrent.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Pattycake!  Pattycake!

                               VALIANT
               Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a
               good pair of shoes over it.

     ANGLE ON RUG

     Roger's tears have formed a puddle around the desk.  Valiant
     lifts a well-worn oxford and shakes the water off it.


     MAROON

     hands Roger his handkerchief.  Roger AAH-OO-GA'S his nose.

                               MAROON
               Take comfort, son, you're not the first
               man whose wife played pattycake on him.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I don't believe it.  I won't believe
               it.

                               MAROON
               The pictures don't lie.  Mr. Valiant
               here took them himself.

     Roger takes another look at the pictures.


     CLOSE - PHOTOS

     They're shots of Jessica Rabbit and Marvin Acme seated knee
     to knee, caught in the act of slapping palms... really
     playing pattycake.


     BACK TO SCENE

     Maroon gets up and crosses to a bar table set up by the
     window.  He pours a drink from a crystal decanter as Roger
     starts sobbing again.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               But Jessy... she's the light of my
               life, the apple of my eye, the cream in
               my coffee...

     Valiant eyes the booze longingly as he mutters to himself.

                               VALIANT
               Well, you better start thinkin' about
               drinkin' it black.

                               MAROON
               Frankly, I'm shocked.  Marvin Acme's
               been my friend and neighbor for thirty
               years.

     Maroon gestures out the window.  We see a blinking neon sign
     on the roof of the building across the street -- "Acme - If
     It's Acme - It's A Gasser!"

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               Who would have thought he was the Sugar
               Daddy?

     Maroon turns and carries the drink to Roger.  Meanwhile,
     Valiant sidles over to the bar to help himself.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               Well, the important thing now Roger, is
               to put all this behind you.
                      (hands him
                       drink)
               Drink this, son, you'll feel better.

     Roger takes the glass and shoots it down in one gulp.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               I know this all seems painful now, but
               you'll find someone new.  Won't he, Mr,
               Valiant?

     Eddie has just picked up the decanter to pour one for
     himself.

                               VALIANT
                      (over shoulder)
               Oh, yeah.  Good lookin' guy like him.
               Dames'll be breakin' his door down.


     CLOSE - ROGER

     The booze is taking its effect.  There's a RUMBLE like a
     volcano about to erupt.  Suddenly Roger's head turns into a
     Toon steam whistle SHRIEKING.  The HIGH PITCH causes glass
     objects in the room to SHATTER... including the crystal
     decanter that Valiant's holding in his hand.  It EXPLODES,
     soaking his suit with booze.  Valiant looks down at the
     damage, completely exasperated.

                               VALIANT
               Son-of-a-bitch...
                      (turns)
               Mr. Maroon, I think I'll be goin' now,
               so about the rest of my fee...

                               MAROON
               Sure, Valiant, sure...

     Maroon sits at the desk and writes a check.

                               MAROON
               Being experienced in these matrimonial
               matters, you have any advice for our
               friend here?

     Valiant crosses to the desk and takes the check.

                               VALIANT
               My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get
               yourself a quickie divorce.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Divorce?  Never!

     Suddenly Roger jumps onto Maroon's desk and grabs Valiant by
     the lapels.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Marriage is a two-way street and we're
               just experiencing a detour!  Jessica
               and I are going to get back together.
               We're going to be happy!   H-A-P-P-I!

     Roger zips off the desk and CRASHES out the window, leaving a
     rabbit outline in the glass... backlit by the blinking Acme
     sign.  Maroon and Valiant walk to the window and look out the
     rabbit-shaped hole in the window.

                               VALIANT
               At least he took it well.


     INT. VALIANT'S BUNGALOW - CLOSE - EMPTY BOOZE BOTTLE - EARLY
     MORNING

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL the bottle's on the floor next to the
     couch Valiant's passed out on.  He's still dressed in his
     clothes.  PAN the small studio apartment.  In the
     kitchen/alcove, Valiant has created a makeshift darkroom.  We
     see a curtain on a clothesline.  Various trays, and some
     pictures clipped up on clothespins.  The pictures depict
     Jessica Rabbit and Marvin Acme in various states of
     pattycake.  Now there is LOUD POUNDING on the door.  But it
     doesn't break through VaLiant's subconscious for several
     seconds.  Finally, he rouses, gets up and walks a crooked
     line to the door.  Valiant opens it and squints into the
     excruciating sunlight.  When his eyes focus, REVEAL a
     hang-dog POLICE DETECTIVE holding Eddie's morning paper.

                               VALIANT
               Lieutenant Santino... how ya doin'?

     Santino ignores the question and regards Valiant with a
     mixture of disgust and pity.

                               LT. SANTINO
               Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for
               a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.

                               VALIANT
               That's what you woke me up for?

     Santino flops open the morning paper.  Valiant's eyes narrow
     as he reads it.  The headline screams:  "TOON KILLS MAN!" And
     underneath:  "Marvin Acme Murdered at the Hands of Jealous
     Rabbit".  Santino throws the paper on the sofa.

                               LT. SANTINO
               You got trouble, Eddie.

     EXT. ACME FACTORY - DAY

     An L.A. police car turns into the yard of the Acme factory
     and pulls up in front of the old factory building.  There's
     all kinds of official activity in the yard... cop cars, a
     Coroner's truck, etcetera.

     Valiant and Santino get out of the police car.  Santino
     starts into the factory.  But he realizes Valiant's not
     following him.  He turns to see Valiant looking over the wall
     behind the factory, transfixed.

                               LT. SANTINO
               Now what?

                               VALIANT
               Just haven't been this close to
               Toontown for awhile.


     VALIANT'S POV

     The sky above the wall is a different color, a little bit
     more vibrant, a "Toon Blue", you might call it.


     SANTINO

     walks back and takes Valiant's arm.

                               LT. SANTINO
               Let's go, somebody wants to see you.

     Santino leads Valiant into the factory.


     INT. FACTORY - DAY

     It's a large warehouse filled with stacks of Toon gags,..
     boxes of dynamite, giant slingshots, boulders, everything
     you've ever seen in a Roadrunner cartoon.  Santino stops
     where a large black safe is imbedded at a cockeyed angle in
     the floor.  A FORENSIC TEAM is at work around the safe.
     They're chalking the outline around a body half obscured by
     the safe.

                               LT. SANTINO
               They say the rabbit got the safe idea
               from a cartoon he was makin' the other
               day.

                               VALIANT
               What a gasser.

                               LT. SANTINO
               Wait here...

     Santino walks to Acme's glassed office where a sobbing
     Jessica Rabbit is being interrogated.  We can only see her,
     not the person doing the interrogating.  Valiant sidles over
     to where the Forensic Guys are dusting the photographs he had
     taken for prints.  One of the Forensic Guys looks up from his
     work.

                               FORENSIC #1
               Say, didn't you used to be Eddie
               Valiant?

     Valiant ignores the slings and arrows and surveys the scene
     of the crime.  The door of the safe is ajar.  Valiant tries
     to look inside.  Forensic #2 closes the door with his knee.

     Now we HEAR the VOICE of Jessica Rabbit from behind them.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Mr. Valiant?

     Valiant turns to the voice.  WHAP!  Jessica slaps him hard
     enough across the face to make his head turn.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               I hope you're proud of yourself.

     She turns on her heel and storms off, sobbing into a
     handkerchief.  Valiant, rubbing his jaw, looks after her.  So
     do the Forensic Guys.

                               FORENSIC #1
               She likes you, Valiant.

                               FORENSIC #2
                      (low wolf
                       whistle)
               When they drew her, they broke the
               pencil.

     Now two WHITE-JACKETS from the Coroner's office start to
     carry Acme out on a stretcher.  As they pass Valiant, a hand
     still wearing a Hand Buzzer flops out.  Valiant grabs it --
     stopping the stretcher.

                               VALIANT
               Makes you wonder what in the world she
               was doin' with a guy who didn't clean
               his fingernails.


     CLOSE - HAND

     Imbedded under the fingernails is a reddish-brown substance.

                               FORENSIC #1
               So... it's blood.


     VALIANT

     peels a piece of it off... it chips and falls to the ground.
     He squats to examine it.

                               VALIANT
               It's not blood, it's paint.

     Suddenly the end of a cane comes down on Valiant's hand,
     pinning it to the floor.  Valiant follows the cane UP to it's
     gavel-shaped head -- past black pants, a black robe, to a
     cadaver-like complected face, and a large hooked proboscis.
     The head is shaved.  Rimless tinted glasses obscure the eyes.
     Although he's human, the total appearance is frighteningly
     vulture-like.  JUDGE DOOM is accompanied by Santino.

                               DOOM
               Is this man removing evidence from the
               scene of a crime?

                               LT. SANTINO
                      (deferential)
               Uh... no, Judge Doom.  Valiant here was
               just about to hand it over, weren't
               you, Valiant?

                               DOOM
               I'll take that.

     Doom takes his cane off Eddie's hand and reaches out for the
     paint chip.  Valiant palms a piece and drops a smaller piece
     into Doom's hand.  Doom examines it.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Looks like the deceased grabbed a
               handful of your client's pantaloons,
               Mr. Valiant.

     Valiant stands to face the Judge, who towers over him.

                               VALIANT
               He's not my client.  I was workin' for
               R.K. Maroon.

                               DOOM
               Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told
               us the rabbit became quite agitated
               when you showed him the pictures, and
               said nothing would stand in the way of
               him getting his wife back.  Is that
               true?

                               VALIANT
               Hey, pal, do I look like a
               stenographer?

                               LT. SANTINO
               Watch your mouth, Eddie, he's a judge.

     Doom smiles thinly at Valiant, tarns and walks with purpose
     towards the door.  Santino and Valiant follow.

                               DOOM
               The rabbit's movements are fairly clear
               after leaving the Maroon Studios.  He
               ran across the street, jimmied this
               door open, hoisted the safe on a block
               and tackle...


     EXT. ACME FACTORY

     Doom leads them outside and indicates a window.

                               DOOM
               ... then stood out here waiting for his
               prey.  After he cold-bloodedly
               accomplished his task, he went home.
               He was almost apprehended there by my
               men.

     Doom nods his head toward a group of sinister WEASLES (a la
     Disney's "Wind In The Willows").  They're loitering by a
     dogcatcher's wagon with "Toontown Control" on the side,
     cleaning their fingernails with switchblades and polishing
     Toon revolvers.
         
                               VALIANT
               Men?  They look more like weasles to
               me.

                               DOOM
               Yes, I find that weasles have a special
               gift for the work.
                      (turns back to
                       Valiant)
               The rabbit didn't contact you by any
               chance, did he?

                               VALIANT
               Why would he contact me?  I just took
               some lousy pictures.

                               DOOM
               So you wouldn't have any idea where he
               might be?

                               VALIANT
               Have you tried Walla Walla?  Kokomo's
               very nice this time of year.

     Doom steps into Valiant's face.

                               DOOM
               I'm surprised you aren't more
               cooperative, Mr. Valiant.  A human has
               been murdered by a Toon.  Don't you
               appreciate the magnitude of that?  My
               goal as Judge of Toontown, has been to
               rein in the insanity.  To bring a
               semblance of law and order to a place
               where no civilized person has ever been
               able to step foot.
               The only way to do that is to make the
               Toons respect the law.

     Suddenly a "YA-HA-HOOEY" interrupts his pontification, as a
     scruffy little TOON GOPHER comes hurtling over the wall from
     the Toontown side.  He's holding his blackened rear end...
     apparently the result of a run-in with a stick of dynamite.
     BONK!  The Gopher hits Doom in the back of the head, sending
     them both sprawling.  The Gopher picks himself up and shakes
     off the effects of the concusion.  When he sees who he's
     knocked down, he panics.

                               GOPHER
                      (petrified)
               Judge Doom!  Here, let me get that for
               ya.

     He whips a clothes brush out of his back pocket and furiously
     tries to clean the Judge's cloak.  Doom picks up the Gopher
     by the scruff of the neck and gets to his feet.

                               DOOM
               Why, you filthy little vagrant, you've
               soiled my robe!

                               GOPHER
               It's cleanin' up real good. Judge.

                               DOOM
               You've defiled a symbol of justice.

     As Doom carries the Gopher to the "Toontown Control" wagon,
     Valiant shoots a look to Santino.

                               VALIANT
                      (aside)
               Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?

                               LT. SANTINO
               No one knows.  He bought the election
               a few years back.  He's been rulin'
               Toontown ever since.

     When Doom gets to the wagon, the Weasles open up the back.
     In place of steel bars is a stream of fluid.  A Weasle turns
     a key and the flow of liquid stops.  The Gopher starts
     kicking furiously, trying to avoid the lock-up.

                                       GOPHER
                Oh, no, Judge, please, please, lemme
                go.  I think I hear my mother callin'
                me.

     Finally, the Gopher breaks free and makes a desperate dash
     for the wall.  Doom watches him run and calmly turns to where
     his car is parked.  It's a black Lincoln touring car with an
     ugly bird-like hood ornament.

                               DOOM
               Voltaire... the Gopher!

     Suddenly. the hood ornament SQUAWKS to life.  It's a hideous
     TOON VULTURE.  The Vulture flaps into flight.

     Just as the Gopher is about to make it over the top of the
     wall the Vulture's talons sink into his rear end and lift him
     airborne.  The Vulture drops the Gopher off with the Weasles.
     They pin him down.

                               GOPHER
               Hey, don't I have any rights?

                               DOOM
               Yes, you do... to a swift and speedy
               trial.

     One of the Weasles retrieves a briefcase from the sedan, puts
     it on the hood and snaps it open.  Twelve TOON KANGAROOS pop
     up, arranged in a jury box.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Court is now in session.

     He raps the Gopher on the head with the gavel end of his
     cane.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               The defendant is charged with vagrancy,
               assault and resisting arrest.  How do
               you find him?

     The Kangaroo court delivers the verdict instantly. Twelve
     LITTLE KANGAROOS pop up out of their Momma's pouches, holding
     up small cards, each with a letter spelling Y-O-U A-R-E
     G-U-I-L-T-Y.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Guilty as charged.  Case closed!

     Doom slams the briefcase shut.  He turns his attention back
     to the Gopher.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               I hereby sentence you to the dip!

                               GOPHER
               Oh no, not the dip!  Anything but the
               dip!  I'm too young to die...

     As the Judge pulls on a black rubber glove, the Weasles take
     out a stainless steel tub WHEEZING with sadistic glee.  They
     fill it from a spigot on the truck.

                               VALIANT
               What's with the dip?

                               LT. SANTINO
               That's how he gets rid of the
               troublemakers.  It's a combination of
               acetone, turpentine and paint remover.
               He calls it the...  Final Solution.


     THE GOPHER

     is wriggling and SCREAMING bloody murder as Doom lifts him up
     and holds him over the tub.  Then, as he's lowered into the
     solution, he starts to disappear. His pathetic SCREAMS are
     snuffed MID-YELP.

                               GOPHER
               Help!  Help!  He...

     The Gopher's gone.  All that's left of him is a paint slick
     on the surface of the liquid.

                               VALIANT
               Jesus.

     Doom pulls off the black rubber gloves finger by finger and
     hands them to a Weasle.  He turns to Valiant.

                               DOOM
                They're not kid gloves, Mr. Valiant.
                but that's how we handle things in
                Toontown.  I would think you'd
                appreciate that.

     He gets into his car, he pauses and looks back at Valiant.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               After all, didn't a Toon kill your
               brother?


     INT. TERMINAL BAR - DAY

     Dolores is behind the bar cutting lemon peels and preparing
     for the day's bartending.  There's one early customer, a
     grey-haired TROLLEYMAN in his Red Car uniform.  His hat's on
     the stool next to him and he's already drunk.  The door
     opens.  It's Valiant.  He walks over to the bar, reaches for
     a bottle and a shot glass and helps himself.  Dolores picks
     up a copy of the morning paper.

                               DOLORES
               Hey, Eddie, looks like you really
               stepped in it this time.

                               VALIANT
               What are you complaining about?  Here's
               your fifty bucks.

     Valiant slides the check across the bar.

                               TROLLEYMAN
                      (mumbling to
                       himself)
               Thirty-five years and all I got to show
               for it is a ticket punch.

                               VALIANT
               What's with Earl?

                               DOLORES
               A new outfit bought the Red Car.  Some
               big company called Cloverleaf
               Industries.

                               VALIANT
               No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?

                               DOLORES
               Bastards put him on notice.

     Valiant picks up his glass. lifts it in toast to the
     Trolleyman.

                               VALIANT
               Here's to the pencil pushers.  May they
               all get lead poisoning.

     Now the Trolleyman unsteadily climbs up on his stool to get
     close to the Holy Grail... the Red Car route map over the
     bar.

                               TROLLEYMAN
                      (wistfully)
               The old Number Six Line... who'da
               thought they'd close that one down?

                               DOLORES
               Eddie, get him down from there.  He's
               gonna break his neck.

     Eddie grabs Earl around the legs and throws him over his
     shoulder like a sack of potatoes.  He carries him over to a
     booth and puts him down carefully, covering him with a
     tablecloth.

                               TROLLEYMAN
               Took you right to Toontown, it did.

                               VALIANT
               I know, I know... poor S.O.B.

     Valiant walks back to his drink at the bar.

                               DOLORES
               Do you think the rabbit did it?

                               VALIANT
               I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
               Make that a round.

     Valiant and Dolores look down the bar, but there's no one
     there.  Finally the familiar cowlick of Baby Herman rises to
     the top of the bar as he clambers up a barstool.

                               DOLORES
               We don't serve formula. Snookums.

                               BABY HERMAN
               You serve martinis, doncha?

                               DOLORES
               Yeah...

    Baby Herman slides his baby bottle down the bar to Dolores.

                               BABY HERMAN
               Make it dry.  Baby doesn't like to be
               wet.
                      (to Valiant)
               You're Valiant, right?  The name's Baby
               Herman.

                               VALIANT
               I know who you are.  Kinda out of your
               neighborhood, aren't you?

                               BABY HERMAN
               Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a
               friend of mine's bein' framed.

                               VALIANT
               You mean the rabbit?  They got him
               cold.

                               BABY HERMAN
               You don't believe that.  I mean. the
               guy's an idiot, a moron, a complete
               fool...  but he'd never kill anyone.
               I know the guy.

     Dolores brings Baby Herman his baby bottle cocktail.

                               BABY HERMAN
                      (continuing)
               Thanks, doll.

     When Dolores turns around, Baby Herman pats her on the
     bottom.

                               DOLORES
                      (over her
                       shoulder)
               Oh, a ladies man, huh?

                               BABY HERMAN
                      (sotto voce; to
                       Valiant)
               My problem is I got a fifty-year-old
               lust and a three-year-old dinkie.

                               VALIANT
               My problem is I come here to drink in
               peace.  So if you don't mind...

                               BABY HERMAN
               C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole
               thing smell a bit funny to you?  I
               mean, no offense, but how did a
               mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in
               the first place?

                               DOLORES
                      (chiming in)
               Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an
               ad in the Yellow Pages.

                               VALIANT
               Thanks for the vote of confidence.

                               BABY HERMAN
               And another thing, the paper said no
               will was found.  But every Toon knows
               Acme had a will and, in it he promised
               to leave Toontown to the Toons.

                               VALIANT
               So where is it then?

                               BABY HERMAN
               Somebody took it from him.  That's what
               this whole thing's about.

                               DOLORES
               The papers said the safe door was
               opened, Eddie.

                               VALIANT
               Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya,
               Dolores?

                               BABY HERMAN
               My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always
               was after Acme's property.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?

     Valiant takes the paint chip out of his pocket and dangles it
     in front of Baby Herman.

                               BABY HERMAN
               No.  But neither does Roger.  That's
               Diablo Red.  Roger's pants are Sunrise
               Orange.

                               DOLORES
               Well, I'll be...

                               BABY HERMAN
               So what's your next move, Valiant?

                               VALIANT
               My next move?  That's easy.  I'm
               gettin' up, and I'm walkin' out the
               door, and I'm goin' home to bed.

     Valiant stands.

                               DOLORES
               So you're not even gonna bother to find
               out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?

                               VALIANT
               He's a Toon... who cares?

     Baby Herman shakes his head sorrowfully.  As Valiant heads
     for the door, Dolores whaps her towel down on the bar.

                               DOLORES
               Well, you used to care, Eddie.  And it
               didn t matter if a client's skin was
               black, white, or painted!

     Valiant ignores her and walks out the door.


     INT. VALIANT'S HOUSE - DAY

     Eddie comes in the door with his coat over his shoulder.  He
     tosses the jacket over the chair and walks to the Murphy bed.
     He grabs the strap, and loosening his tie, walks away from
     the wall, pulling the bed down.  What he doesn't see is...


     ROGER RABBIT

     asleep in the bed.


     VALIANT

     still with his back to Roger, sits down exhaustedly on the
     bed and kicks off his shoes.  He lies back and pulls the
     covers over him.  He closes his eyes, rolls over to get
     comfortable.  Now he and Roger are nose-to-nose.  They both
     open their eyes at the same time.  They freak.

                               VALIANT
                      (screams)
               Aah!

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (screams)
               Aah!

     They both jump out of the bed.

                               VALIANT
               What the hell are you doin'?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I needed a place to hide.  I'm in
               trouble, Eddie.

                               VALIANT
               So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could
               get me a rap for aiding and abetting.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm
               here.

                               VALIANT
               Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my
               house?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well, I asked the newsboy on the
               corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked
               a janitor, the fireman and finally the
               green grocer down the way.  He was very
               helpful.

                               VALIANT
               In other words, the whole goddamn world
               knows you're here!  Out!  Get out!

     Eddie tries to open the door, but Roger blocks it
     spider-like, arms and legs extended.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Please, Eddie, don't put me out.  I
               didn't do it, I swear.

     Valiant gives up trying to open the door and grabs Roger.  He
     pulls and he pulls.  Finally Roger snaps off like a broken
     rubber band.  The two of them go tumbling backward.  Valiant
     makes a grab for Roger but he slips out of his grasp like
     quicksilver.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               Sure I wanted to win Jessy back, but
               not that way.

     Valiant lunges again.  Roger dodges.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               After I left you, I went to see her at
               the Ink & Paint Club.

     Valiant picks himself up and tries to catch his breath.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               She was on stage, so I found a piece of
               paper and wrote her a love letter.

     Roger pulls a piece of paper out of his pocket and starts
     reading.

                                ROGER RABBIT
                       (continuing)
               'Dear Jessy.  How do I love thee?  Let
               me count the ways.  1-1000, 2-1000,
               3-1000...

     Valiant leaps for Roger and gets bim by the throat.  He rips
     the paper out of Roger's hand and crumples it up and throws
     it down.  He opens the door, throws Roger outside and quickly
     slams the door shut.  He leans against it, breathing hard.
     Suddenly, Roger comes through the mail slot like a limbo
     dancer.  Valiant, too tired to chase him, just watches him.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               Hey, that wasn't very nice.

     He retrieves the love letter, straightens it and puts it back
     in his pocket.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               It took me almost an hour to compose
               that.  But I decided not to leave it
               anyway.  I'd read it in person, that
               was my plan.

     Valiant crosses to the kitchen area where the dark room is
     still set up.  He opens the cabinet under the sink and comes
     out with a bottle of Scotch.  He takes a shot glass and pours
     himself one.

                               VALIANT
               Look, pal, if you're still here when I
               finish this drink, I'm callin' the
               police.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya.
               The police'll just dip me.  They were
               waitin' for me when I got home last
               night.  I ran.

                               VALIANT
               If you're so innocent, why'd you run?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always
               run.

     Valiant shoots the drink down and holds up the empty glass.
         
                               VALIANT
               That's it.

     He crosses to the phone on the counter.  He lifts the
     receiver and starts to dial.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well, this is the moment of truth!  And
               I've spoken the truth, but you won't
               believe the truth.  So I guess the
               truth is my goose is cooked, my hash is
               slung. my fait is accompli.

     As Valiant finishes dialing, he idly puts the empty shot
     glass down on a photograph on the counter.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               Won't anything change your mind?

     Valiant turns from the pleading rabbit.  Now something he
     sees on the counter gets his attention.


     POV THROUGH SHOT GLASS

     The shot glass is resting on one of the reject pictures of
     Acme and Jessica.  The bottom of the glass is magnifying the
     back of the exuberant Marvin Acme.  Sticking out of his back
     pocket is a legal folder headed "Last Will and Testament".


     CLOSE - VALIANT

     He looks as if the truth has just hit him in the face.

                               VALIANT
               The goddamn will.

                               VOICE
                      (on phone)
               L.A.P.D.?

     Valiant slowly returns the phone to the cradle,

                               ROGER RABBIT
               You mean you believe me?

     Now outside we HEAR TIRES SCREECHING to a stop.  Roger runs
     to the window and pulls back the drapes.  His eyes bug out of
     his head.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               It's Toon Control!

     Valiant comes to the window and looks out, too.


     VALIANT'S POV

     The Toon Control wagon has stopped in front of the house.
     The Weasles pile out.  One of them takes what looks like a
     butterfly net out of the back.  Several others grab violin
     cases.


     EDDIE AND ROGER

     Valiant jerks Roger back behind the curtain.

                               VALIANT
               Get away from that window.

     Roger, elated, jumps into Valiant's arms.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               You're gonna help me?  How can I ever
               thank you?

     He plants a big wet Toon kiss on Valiant's lips.

                               VALIANT
               For starters... don't ever kiss me.


     EXT. BUNGALOW

     The Weasles are filing up the walk to the front door.  The
     leader pounds on the front door.

                               WEASLE
               Police...


     INT. BUNGALOW

     Valiant puts Roger down.

                               VALIANT
               I'll talk to 'em.  Find a place to
               hide.

     Roger zips to the closet door and goes inside.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Not in there.  That's the first place
               they'll look.

     Valiant goes to the closet and opens the door.  REVEAL Roger
     is now dressed in Eddie's trenchcoat and hat.  Playfully,
     Roger snaps one of the handcuffs onto Eddie's wrist.  He's
     got the Other attached to one of his wrists.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest!
               Just kidding...

                               VALIANT
               You idiot.  I lost the key for those
               cuffs.

     BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!  The KNOCKING is more impatient.  Valiant
     looks to the door.

                               WEASLE (O.S.)
               Open up!


     EXT. VALIANT'S DOOR

     The Weasles open the violin cases and take out real tommy guns
     and shoulder them in teams of two.  Suddenly they unleash a
     torrent of MACHINE GUN FIRE, making the outline of a weasle
     in the door with BULLETS.  The leader blows on the cut-out
     and it falls in.  The Weasles file through one by one.


     INT. APARTMENT

     The Weasles don't bother to look around.  They all just start
     BLASTING.  Bullets fly every which way.  The barrage destroys
     Valiant's apartment in a matter of seconds.  When the
     shooting stops and the smoke clears, the Weasles look around.
     The head Weasle spots blood all over the kitchen floor.

                                WEASLE #1
               We got him.

     But when he looks behind the counter, it's only a shattered
     ketchup bottle.


     EXT. REAR OF APARTMENT

     Eddie and Roger, handcuffed together, are beating it down the
     alley.  Roger, being a rabbit, is beating it a lot faster.
     He's kicking up dust, his legs are blur.  Valiant stumbles
     trying to keep up.  When they round the corner, Roger slams
     on the brakes, Toon style.  Valiant goes skidding past him and
     is jerked to a stop like a dog on a short leash.

                               VALIANT
               Hey!  What do you think you're doin'?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a
               Toon.

                               VALIANT
               Don't ever forget that.


     EXT. BUNGALOW - BACK WINDOW - THE WEASLES

     come piling out the window.  They start sniffing the ground.
     Suddenly one of them freezes on point, like a dog.  Another
     blows a HUNTER'S HORN and they're off on the trail.


     EXT. STREET - EDDIE AND ROGER

     emerge from the alley.  They pause momentarily to
     reconnoiter.  Eddie decides to go left, Roger right.  When
     they get to the end of the cuffs, they snap back into a pile.
     Valiant gets back to his feet and hauls Roger up angrily.

                               VALIANT
               This way, goof...

     They start across the street.  But Roger goes on one side of
     the Street sign, Eddie the other.  Roger coils around it like
     a tether ball.  Valiant yanks Roger off the sign and they
     duck across the street just as a trolley car passes.


     THE WEASLES

     come bloodhounding around the corner.  They search the street
     for signs of the fugitive.  But when they get to the trolley
     tracks, they stop, bewildered.

                               WEASLE #1
               Scent's cold.

                               WEASLE #2
               Pssst.

     He points toward the trolley car pulling into the Terminal
     Station.  They fall all over themselves scurrying over to the
     trolley.  They surround it and jump aboard, tommy-gun at the
     ready.


     INT. RED CAR

     The CONDUCTOR raises his hands like it was a hold-up.  A
     couple PASSENGERS scream as the Weasles search the car.  But
     no Roger or Eddie.  As quickly as they got on, they get off.


     EXT. RED CAR

     as it pulls away.  The Weasles look around perplexed.

                               WEASLE #1
               Funny... I could swear I smelled
               rabbit.


     ANGLE FROM ABOVE

     Eddie and Roger are balanced on the trolley wire above the
     Weasles' heads.  As the Weasles sniff around the barn, Eddie
     and Roger ease along the wire, using the wall of the Terminal
     Bar to lean on.


     INT. TERMINAL BAR - KITCHEN

     Dolores is preparing corned beef and cabbage.  The RADIO is
     PLAYING "MARES EAT OATS".  A NEWSCASTER breaks into the
     music.

                               NEWSCASTER
               News flash... Hollywood.  Citywide
               Toonhunt for Roger Rabbit, suspect in
               Acme slaying.  Police describe him as
               short, cuddly...  and psychotic.

     Dolores turns just as Roger's grinning face appears in the
     window.

                               DOLORES
                      (startled)
               Mother Mary...

     Now Eddie's face comes into view.  He motions for her to open
     the window.


     OUTSIDE THE WINDOW

     Roger and Eddie watch another trolley approach.  The contact
     arm sparks its way along the wire as it rolls along towards
     them.  Valiant watches as Dolores struggles to get the window
     open.

                               VALIANT
               Hurry, hurry...

     At the last second, the window opens.  Eddie jumps for the
     sill, Roger dangling from the cuffs as the trolley passes.


     INT. KITCHEN

     Dolores helps pull Valiant through the window.  Then he drags
     Roger inside.

                               DOLORES
               Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it
               is?

                               VALIANT
               Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.

     Roger bows at the waist, takes her hand and kisses it like
     Charles Boyer

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Charmed, enchanted, pleasure's all
               mined.

                               DOLORES
               Where'd you find him?

                               VALIANT
               The Toon Fairy left him under my
               pillow.

     Now Roger spots a plate of freshly shucked corn.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               May I?

     Before she can answer, he grabs an ear, presses it to his
     lips and applies the typewriter method to it.  When he gets
     to the end of a row, we even HEAR the BING!

                               DOLORES
               He's a riot.

                               VALIANT
               Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed
               to him.
                      (holds up
                       cuffs)
               Anybody in the back room?

                               DOLORES
               It's all yours.

     We FOLLOW Dolores as she leads Valiant and Roger across the
     hall.  She stops at a door, unlocks it, and leads them in.


     INT. BACK ROOM

     It's a tiny storage room/office with an institutional metal
     desk, a cot, and assorted janitorial supplies stacked around.
     Dolores shuts and locks the door behind her.  Valiant goes to
     a metal locker and digs through some tools, coming out with a
     hacksaw.  He sits on the cot and starts working on the cuffs.

                               DOLORES
               So you decided to help him after all?

                               VALIANT
               I oughta have my head examined.
                      (to Roger)
               Will you hold still?

     Roger quiets like a child for a moment as Valiant saws
     feverishly.  Then Roger slips his hand out of the cuff and
     holds his side while Eddie keeps sawing.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Does this help?

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, that's better.

     Valiant saws a couple more strokes before the realization of
     what Roger's done hits him.  His face darkens.  Roger sees
     the look and sheepishly tries to recover by sticking his hand
     back in the cuff.

                               VALIANT
               You mean to tell me you coulda taken
               your hand outta that cuff at any time?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well, no, not any time.  Only when it
               was funny.

     Valiant looks at Roger like he's about to brain him.  Roger
     pulls his hand free again, and cowers out of range.  Valiant
     just rubs his forehead.

                               VALIANT
               Are you always this funny, or only on
               days when you're wanted for murder?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               My philosophy is if you don't have a
               sense of humor, you're better off dead.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah... well you just might get your
               wish.

                               DOLORES
               Can you get him out of it, Eddie?

                               VALIANT
               If I can find whoever wanted to kill
               Acme bad enough to get this.

     Valiant throws the pattycake picture down on the table.
     Dolores and Roger both examine it closely.

                               DOLORES
               Acme's will.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               So that's what this little drama is all
               about.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah.  I think Maroon plays the part of
               the sound mind, your wife the sound
               body.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I resent that innuendo!  My wife is
               completely innocent.

                               VALIANT
               Your wife may be a lot of things, pal,
               but innocent isn't one of them.

                               DOLORES
               So what's the scam, Eddie?

                               VALIANT
               Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody
               wants Acme's property.  Cack the old
               man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the
               will.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               The habeus corpus is thickening.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't
               think they got the will.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               How do you know that?

                               VALIANT
               Well, Acme had the will in his pocket
               that night at the club.  It was gone in
               the morning when the cops found the
               body.

                               DOLORES
               Maybe they just took it out of his
               pocket.

                               VALIANT
               Then why'd they bother to crack the
               safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from
               Mount Baldy and it won't open.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your
               logic is specious.  What prevented Mr.
               Acme from putting the will back in the
               safe before they killed him?

                               VALIANT
               Because he's not forty feet tall.  The
               safe was up on the ceiling, remember?

     Dolores whistles over his deductions.

                               DOLORES
               Eddie, you still got it.  Hey, tomorrow
               maybe I'll go down to probate court and
               see who's sniffin' around Acme's
               estate?

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, do that.  I'm gonna go rattle
               Maroon's cage.

     Valiant finishes sawing the cuffs.  He stands and throws the
     cuffs aside.  Valiant and Dolores go to the door.  Roger
     follows them eagerly.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               What should I do?  Who should I see?
               Where should I go?

     Valiant turns.

                               VALIANT
               Nothin', no one, nowhere,

     He slams the door.


     INT. POLO LOUNGE - CLOSE - MAROON

     He's in a booth in the middle of a business lunch.

                               MAROON
               Maybe money grows on trees in Toontown,
               but not at the Maroon Studio.

     WIDEN THE SHOT to REVEAL that Maroon's sharing a booth with
     BUGS BUNNY and his AGENT.  Bugs is chewing on a carrot.

                               BUGS BUNNY
               Look, Doc, fiduciary considerations
               aside, Roger Rabbit may have been
               willing to play second banana to an
               ankle-biter, but I ain't.


     ACROSS THE ROOM

     A MAITRE D' is leading Valiant and Augie, the deaf-mute to a
     table by the door.

                               VALIANT
               This'll be fine, huh, Augie?

      Augie nods his head.  They sit and pick up the menus.  Augie
      takes one peek and looks at Valiant, alarmed.  He scribbles a
      note.  Valiant reads it.

                               VALIANT
               Forget about the prices, pal.  If you
               want the shrimp cocktail, you have a
               shrimp cocktail.
                      (puts menu
                       down)
               Excuse me, Augie, I've got a little
               table-hopping to do.

      Valiant gets up from the table and starts across the room.


      AT MAROON'S BOOTH

                               AGENT
               I think you should know, R.K., we're in
               negotiations for Bugs to star in his
               own series at Warner Brothers.

                               MAROON
               Trying to scare up a bidding war
               between me and Jack Warner, eh?  Well,
               it won't work.  I'll call William
               Morris and I'll have 'em put out a
               rabbit call the likes of which this
               town's never seen!

                               BUGS BUNNY
               It's your dime, Doc.

                               MAROON
               And stop callin' me Doc!

                               BUGS BUNNY
               Eh, sure, Doc.

     Now Valiant arrives, pulls up a chair from next table and
     sits down.

                               VALIANT
               Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?

                               MAROON
               Valiant?  What're you doin' here?

                               VALIANT
               I Just thought I'd drop by and show you
               a photograph.

                               MAROON
               I've already seen your photographs.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, but I enlarged this one.  Thought
               you might be interested.

     Valiant takes an enlargement of the pattycake shot and puts
     it on the table in front of Maroon.  We can clearly see the
     will sticking out of Acme's pocket.

                               VALIANT
               Anyway... enjoy your lunch.

     Valiant stands and departs.  But his visit has done it's
     trick.  Maroon looks l'ike he's seen a ghost.  We FOLLOW
     Valiant across the room to his table where Augie is
     blissfully attacking a shrimp cocktail.

                               VALIANT
               How is that, Augie, pretty good?

     Augie nods enthusiastically.  Valiant keeps an eye on
     Maroon's booth.  Now he nudges Augie as Maroon excuses
     himself and goes into the phone booth just outside the door.
     Augie puts his shrimp fork down and picks up his pencil.


     AUGIE'S POV

     We see Maroon talk on the phone MOS.  As his lips move,
     Valiant supplies his words.

                               VALIANT (V.O.)
               It's me.  Valiant says there's a will.
               I don't know what he's trying to
               pull...


     BACK TO SCENE

     Valiant is reading of Augie's pad as Augie reads Maroon's
     lips, and scribbles down what he says.

                               VALIANT
                      (reading)
               Somebody's gonna have to take care of
               him.

     Augie looks up from his scribbling to exchange an eyebrow
     raising glance with Valiant.  Then he turns back to Maroon
     again.

                               VALIANT
                      (reading)
               The old man had it at the club that
               night.  That's right.  Yeah, I'm sure.
               I'll be there.

     Augie stops writing as Maroon hangs up the phone.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing; to
                       Augie)
               Where?

     Augie shrugs his shoulders.  Disappointed, Valiant lights a
     cigarette.  Now Augie elbows him and gestures across at
     Maroon, who's making another call.  Augie starts writing
     again.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing;
                       reading)
               Iris... cancel my appointments this
               afternoon.  I'll be at Forest Lawn.

     Maroon hangs up the phone and comes out of the phone booth.
     He hustles out of the room.  Valiant stands.

                               VALIANT
               You did great, Augie.  Have another
               shrimp cocktail.

     Valiant drops a twenty on the table and pats Augie on the
     back.


     EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL

     A CARHOP wheels a yellow Packard up in front.  Maroon climbs
     in and ROARS off.  Valiant ENTERS THE FRAME.  He looks after
     Maroon, then calmly starts walking down the driveway.


     EXT. FOREST LAWN CEMETERY - RED CAR STOP - DAY

     A Red Car pulls up.  Valiant climbs off.  He calmly crosses
     the street and ducks behind the cemetery entranceway as
     Maroon's Packard ROARS through.

                               VALIANT
                      (impressed)
               Love that Red Car.

     As Valiant starts to walk up the hill...

                                              CUT TO:


     THE ACME FUNERAL SITE - LONG SHOT - DAY

     A hearse, and a line of black limos are parked in the lane.
     Nearby, Marvin Acme's funeral is in progress.  Clustered
     around a gravesite are the mourners... TOONS of every stripe.
     There's MICKEY MOUSE comforting MINNIE.  TOM AND JERRY.
     HECKLE AND JECKLE.  CHIP 'N DALE.  Everyone from the famous
     to the not so famous is in attendance.  The eulogy is being
     delivered in a familiar blustery Southern VOICE.  It's
     FOGHORN LEGHORN.

                               FOGHORN LEGHORN
               Today we commit the body of brother
               Acme to the cold, I say cold, cold
               ground.  We shed no tears for we know
               that Marvin is going to a better place.
               That high, high, I say that
               high-larious place up in the sky.

     Foghorn Leghorn dramatically points skyward.

                               TOONS
                      (in unison)
               A-men!


     NEW ANGLE - VALIANT

     is leaning up against a palm tree on the hill.  We have been
     watching the proceedings from his POV.  Now he sees Maroon's
     car pull up.  He moves around to the other side of the tree
     as Maroon passes and starts wending his way through the
     crowd.


     AT THE GRAVESITE

     Foghorn Leghorn nods to the funeral DIRECTOR, a pasty-faced
     human in a black mourning coat.  The Director starts to turn
     the crank lowering the coffin into the grave.

                               FOGHORN LEGHORN
               Give us a sign, brother Herman, that
               you've arrived...

     Much to the funeral Director's amazement, the crank starts
     PLINKING Out the tune to "POP GOES THE WEASLE".  Now the Toon
     mourners pick up on it and join in.

                               TOONS
                      (singing)
               Round and round the mullberry bush, The
               monkey chased the weasle...

     The crank and SONG start going FASTER AND FASTER.

                               TOONS
                      (continuing;
                       singing)
               The monkey raid it all was in fun.  POP!
               Goes the weasle.

     Suddenly half of the lid to Acme's coffin flies open and a
     harlequin CLOWN BOI-YOI-YOINGS out.  The funeral Director
     faints dead away as the Toon SOBS turn to LAUGHTER.  The
     Toons turn and head away from the grave comforted by a
     funeral befitting a gag king.  They climb into their cars and
     SCREECH off like the start of the Indy 500.  One mourner is
     left at the gravesite.  Sitting in a chair dabbing at her
     eyes with a handkerchief is Jessica Rabbit.  Maroon walks up
     behind her.

                               MAROON
               So... trying to pull a fast one on me,
               huh?

     Jessica turns, startled.  She stands and faces Maroon.


     VALIANT

     smiles and leans in.  This is the moment he's been waiting
     for.  Now just as the conversation begins, it is drowned out
     by the NOISE from a LAWN MOWER.  Valiant turns to see a
     GARDENER riding around on a small tractor cutting the grass.
     Valiant tries to flag him down as he watches Maroon and
     Jessica having an arguement.  There's accusatory finger
     pointing.  In pantomime, Maroon gestures into his pocket as
     if describing the position of Acme's will.

     Jessica tries to leave.  He grabs her arm.  They're screaming
     at each other but we don't hear a word.  Valiant waves
     frantically for the Gardener to cut the machine.  But the
     Gardener misconstrues it as a friendly greeting and waves
     back.  Valiant turns in time to see Jessica kick Maroon in
     the groin and stomp off to a red Auburn Speedster.  She jumps
     in and speeds away as Maroon staggers back to his car.  The
     Gardener stops the tractor next to Valiant.  He SHUTS OFF THE
     ENGINE.  The cemetery is completely still again.

                               GARDENER
               Somethin' you want, mister?

                               VALIANT
               Not anymore...


     EXT. INK & PAINT CLUB - ALLEY - NIGHT

     A Steinway piano truck is parked next to the stage door.  TWO
     husky PIANO MOVERS are rolling a baby grand up the ramp to
     the stage door.  They knock on the door.  The Gorilla opens
     it and they muscle the piano inside.  After a moment, they
     reemerge.  We FOLLOW them back to the truck where a second
     baby grand stands ready to be moved.

                               MOVER #1
               I don't know about you, but it makes me
               sick to think of these beautiful pianos
               gettin' chopped into match sticks every
               night by those screwy ducks.

     Struggling, they push this second piano into the club.


     INT. CLUB - BACKSTAGE

     They roll the piano over to the wall and park it next to the
     first.

                               MOVER #2
                      (shakes head)
               And they call it entertainment.

     As they go out the stage door, MOVE IN on the baby grand.


     INSIDE THE PIANO - VALIANT

     is lying prone -- using the Steinway as his own Trojan Horse.
     He lifts the piano lid to climb out, but then HEARS FOOTSTEPS
     approaching.  He lowers the lid again.  Now someone starts
     testing the keys.  We see the hammers strike the strings,
     RUNNING UP THE SCALES until they reach the one under
     Valiant's nose.  The hammer whacks Valiant's nose on the
     backswing and strikes the string making a terrible SOUR NOTE.

                               DONALD DUCK (V.O.)
                      (exasperated
                       QUACK)
               Phooey!  Out of tune again!

                               DAFFY DUCK (V.O.)
               Not to worry, Donald.  We can fix that
               with my sledgehammer.

                               DONALD DUCK (V.O.)
               Never mind, Daffy.  I've got an axe in
               my dressing room.

     Valiant's eyes widen.


     ANGLE ON PIANO

     as the VOICES of Daffy and Donald recede, Valiant raises the
     lid and quickly climbs out.  He eases over to Jessica's
     dressing room.  As he starts to open the door, he HEARS
     SCUFFLING from inside.  Valiant puts his ear to the door.
     More SCUFFLING.  Valiant straightens, then suddenly whips the
     door open and flicks on the light.


     INT. DRESSING ROOM

     Nobody's there.  Perplexed, Valiant closes the door behind
     him and checks behind the dressing screen.  In the closet.
     No one.  He shrugs and starts to search the room.  He goes to
     Jessica's dressing table and rifles the drawers.  In her
     purse he discovers a Toon revolver.  He examines it.

                               VALIANT
               Girl's gotta protect herself.

     Valiant puts the gun back in the purse and closes the drawer.
     As he stands, he pauses to consider a Hurrel-like
     black-and-white photo of Roger Rabbit in a silver deco frame.
     He's dramatically posed with a cigarette like he was Tyrone
     Power.

     Valiant shakes his head and turns from the table.  Something
     catches his eye.


     ANGLE ON FLOOR

     Behind the dressing table, the corner of a piece of blue
     paper peeks out.  Valiant stoops down and fishes it out.
     It's a cover for a legal document -- "Last Will and Testament
     -- Marvin Acme".


     VALIANT

     stands, pleased.  He opens the blue folder.  But it's empty.
     Valiant puts it in his inside pocket and turns to go when
     suddenly an unseen hand flicks the lights off.

                               VALIANT
               Son of a bitch...

     We can't see anything in the darkness.  But we hear the SOUND
     of A FISTFIGHT.  There's the CRASHING of lamps and furniture
     breaking.  Now the door opens for a second as the assailant
     escapes.  Light floods in the room, illuminating Valiant on
     the floor with a curtain wrapped around his head.  As he
     struggles free the door closes.  The room is dark again.
     Valiant scrambles to the door.  When he whips it open, REVEAL
     the Gorilla framed in the doorway.  Valiant is frozen.  The
     Gorilla flicks on the light.  He smiles wickedly.

                               GORILLA
               And here I tought we had mice.

     Valiant tries to make a break for it.  WHAM!  The Gorilla
     lays him out cold with a right cross.

                                              BLACKOUT.


     FADE IN:

     VALIANT'S POV FROM FLOOR

     As his vision comes INTO FOCUS, Valiant sees the Gorilla,
     Jessica Rabbit, the Weasles and Judge Doom are standing over
     him.

                               GORILLA
               ... I caught him rummagin' around in
               here.  Then I called you, Judge, on a
               counta you be da one we pay juice to.

                               DOOM
                      (clears throat)
               You did the right thing, Bongo.


     THE WEASLES

     pull a groggy Valiant upright and plop him in a chair in
     front of Doom.

                               DOOM
               Being caught breaking and entering is
               not very good advertising for a
               detective.  What were you looking for,
               Mr. Valiant?

                               VALIANT
               Ask her...

     Valiant nods toward Jessica, who stands coolly smoking a
     cigarette.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Last week some heavy breather wanted
               one of my nylons as a souvenir.  Maybe
               that's what he was after?

                               VALIANT
               Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I
               woulda broken into Frederick's of
               Hollywood.  I was lookin' for Marvin
               Acme's will.

                               DOOM
               Marvin Acme had no will.  I should
               know, the probate is in my court.

                               VALIANT
               He had a will, all right.  She took it
               off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon
               knocked him off.  Then she set up her
               loving husband to take the fall.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               You, Mr. Valiant, are either drunk or
               punch drunk.  Probably both.

                               DOOM
               These are bold accusations, Mr.
               Valiant.  I hope you have some proof?

                               VALIANT
               I found the cover the will came in
               behind the dressing table.

     Valiant reaches into his pocket.  But the blue envelope is
     gone.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               They must've taken it off me.

                               DOOM
               They?

                               VALIANT
               The other people who were in here
               lookin' for the will.  I woulda caught
               'em if Cheetah here hadn't interrupted
               me.

     The Gorilla makes a move for Valiant.  Doom stops him.

                               DOOM
               Take it easy, Bongo.  We'll handle Mr.
               Valiant our own way... downtown.

                               VALIANT
               Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of
               Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk
               to him.

                               DOOM
               Oh, not that downtown.  Toontown.

     The mention of Toontown has a visible impact on Valiant.

                               VALIANT
                      (nervous)
               You're not takin' me to downtown
               Toontown?

                               DOOM
               Indeed we are.  We'll continue the
               interrogation there.

                               VALIANT
                      (very agitated)
               I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me
               Santino.

                               DOOM
               You're a very stubborn man, Mr.
               Valiant.  Very pig-headed.  Boys, show
               Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed
               men at the Toontown station...

     As the Weasles drag Valiant out of the room...

                               VALIANT
                      (screaming)
               No... you bastards!  Leggo of me!


     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     The Toon Control Wagon streaks along with the cat SIREN
     WAILING.  It flashes by then slams on the brakes at the
     entrance to an eerie tunnel.  A sign next to the tunnel says:
     "Toontown".


     INT. WAGON

     The Weasles look over at the bound and gagged Valiant.  One
     of them turns Valiant's head to look at the Toontown sign.

                               WEASLE #1
               What're you shakin' for?  Didn't you
               have a good time last time you were
               here?

     With a wicked WHEEZE, the driver floors it.


     EXT. TUNNEL

     The wagon disappears into the murky darkness.  PAN UP to the
     night sky.

                                              DISSOLVE TO:


     THE SKY - MORNING

     PAN DOWN to the tunnel.  We can't see into the darkness but
     we HEAR HOOTING and HOLLERING from within.  GUNS going off,
     FIRECRACKERS EXPLODING, WHIPS CRACKING, all accompanied by
     the WHEEZING LAUGHTER of the Weasles.

                               WEASLE #1 (O.S.)
               Soo-eey!  Soo-eey!

                               WEASLE #2 (O.S.)
               Let him go, boys.  I think he's got the
               message.

     After a beat, Valiant comes staggering out of the tunnel.
     He's got a burlap sack over his head tied around his waist.
     Behind him, the Weasles emerge holding paint cans and
     brushes.  They watch as he trips and falls by the side of the
     road.  The Weasles GIGGLE victoriously and head back inside.
     Valiant lies there for a moment, catching his breath.  Then
     he struggles to free his hands.  Finally he rips the sack off
     his head and sits up.


     CLOSE - VALIANT

     We see he's got a huge Toon pig with a goofy grin painted
     over his head.  Valiant pulls and tugs on it, but this is a
     costume that won't come off.  Valiant curses, gets to his
     feet and stumbles down the road.


     EXT. RED CAR STOP

     Valiant gets in the back of the line of PASSENGERS boarding
     the Red Car.


     INT. RED CAR - VALIANT

     steps aboard.  The Trolleyman, who we recognize as Earl from
     the Terminal bar, does a double-take when he sees the
     ridiculously silly looking man/Toon.

                               EARL
               Here's one for the books... a Toon
               wearin' human clothes.

                               VALIANT
               Earl... it's me, Valiant.

                               EARL
               Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?

                               VALIANT
               Toon cops worked me over.

                               EARL
               Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real
               Toon-a-Roo.

                               VALIANT
                      (apprehensively)
               What am I, Earl?

     Earl breaks the news to Valiant soberly.

                               EARL
               You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.

                               VALIANT
               No...

                               EARL
               Does it hurt?

                               VALIANT
               Not much.  It's hard to talk.

                               EARL
               Uh, Eddie, do me a favor.  Could you
               sit in the back so you won't cause as
               much of a commotion.

     Valiant tries to pull the brim of his hat down.  But it's
     comically small on the huge head.  He makes his way down the
     aisle past a veritable gauntlet of RAZZING, poking, tripping
     PASSENGERS.  Finally he finds an empty seat in the back as
     the Red Car starts up.


     A LITTLE KID

     wearing a baseball cap is sitting a few seats away with his
     MOTHER.  The Kid looks back at Eddie and laughs.  He leans
     over and whispers something to his Mom.

                               KID
               Can I, Mom?

                               MOMMY
               Go ahead, darling.  Take your bat.

     The Kid takes his baseball bat and approaches Valiant
     innocently.

                               KID
               Hi, Mr. Pig.  If I hit you on the head,
               will you make me a cuckoo bird?

     The Kid starts to take a swing with the bat.

                               VALIANT
               Kid, if you hit me on the head, I'm
               gonna throw you out this window.

     The Kid's eyes widen in terror.  This is not a typical Toon
     response.

                               KID
                      (crying)
                Mommy!


     INT. VALIANT'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY

     We hear the SOUND of the SHOWER.  Valiant's hand reaches out
     past the shower curtain and grabs for a bottle.  But it's not
     shampoo.  It's turpentine.

                               VALIANT (O.S.)
               Dammit!

     CLOSE - TUB DRAIN

     The water swirling down the drain is tinged with paint of
     different colors.


     CLOSE - VALIANT

     He scrubs manically until the last of the pig head is gone.
     He rinses off and he feels around his face.  The absence of
     the Toon mask seems to bring him some relief.  He shuts off
     the shower and slides the shower curtain back.


     VALIANT'S POV - JESSICA RABBIT

     is leaning up against the doorjamb, dressed as usual, in a
     black cocktail dress with elbow length gloves and pearls.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the
               doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear
               it.

                               VALIANT
               That's because I don't have a doorbell.

     Jessica, caught in her lie, flutters her eyelids nervously.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.

                               VALIANT
               Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a
               towel.

     As she hands him a towel, she stares down at his anatomy.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               What's that thing?

     Valiant looks down at what she's referring to.

                               VALIANT
               Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a
               mole before?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Toons aren't given imperfections.

                               VALIANT
               No?  I guess we're not counting lying,
               stealing and murder.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               You've got the wrong idea about me.
               I'a a pawn in this just like poor
               Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll
               pay you anything.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta
               have the rabbit to make the scam work.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               No, no, no... I love my husband.

                               VALIANT
               Oh, sure.  I can just feature you
               standin' outside your little hutch,
               holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby
               to come home.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr,
               Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is
               being a woman looking the way I do.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it
               is bein' a man looking at a woman
               looking the way you do.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.

                               VALIANT
               I'm not complainin'.  But give me
               credit.  I'm the guy who took the
               pictures of you and Acme playin'
               pattycake, remember?

     Jessica takes a cigarette out of her purse.  She lights it
     and blows a cloud of Toon smoke.  It forms a recreation of
     what she describes.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Maroon came to me.  He told me he'd
               fire Roger if I didn't do it.  I went
               along with him for Roger's sake.  It
               was only pattycake, after all.

     Valiant waves at the smoke scene, dispelling it.

                               VALIANT
               So altruistic.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               It's the truth.  Why won't you believe
               it?

                               VALIANT
               Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I
               don't know what you're up to, lady, but
               I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               If I'm as bad as you think, what's
               stopping me from just killing you right
               now?

     Valiant reaches behind him and picks up a small cup on the
     sink.

                               VALIANT
               This cup of turpentine right here.  Go
               for that gun in your purse and I'm
               gonna let you have it.

     Jessica breaks down and starts sobbing.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Oh, Mr, Valiant, please... you're my
               only hope.

     She comes to Eddie and hugs him, burying her head in his
     shoulder.

                                JESSICA RABBIT
               I'm weak... you're strong.  Can't you
               find a place somewhere in your heart to
               help me?

     Valiant looks down at the luscious creature in his arms,
     considering the request.  The moment is interrupted by the
     CLEARING of a VOICE.

                               DOLORES (O.C.)
               Dabblin' in watercolors, Eddie?

     Valiant, still in just a towel, sheepishly turns to face
     Dolores, who's standing in the doorway.

                               VALIANT
               Dolores...

     Dolores regards Jessica with undisguised contempt.

                               DOLORES
               Lemme guess... your cousin from Des
               Moines?

     Jessica straightens her dress.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Perhaps I should go.

                               DOLORES
               Must you?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Goodbye, Eddie... don't hate me.

     Jessica blows Eddie a TOON KISS which flies across the room,
     landing on Eddie's cheek.  She saunters past the smoldering
     Dolores and out the door.  Dolores walks to Eddie and peels
     the kiss off his cheek.  She crumples it up and throws it
     down in the wastebasket.

                               DOLORES
               What was that?

                               VALIANT
               That was the rabbit's wife.

                               DOLORES
               The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what
               she was doin' with her arms around you?

                               VALIANT
               Probably lookin' for a good place to
               stick a knife.

                               DOLORES
               I just stopped by to tell you that I
               checked out the Acme probate.

                               VALIANT
               Maroon, right?

                               DOLORES
               Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit
               again.

                               VALIANT
                      (startled)
               What the hell would they want with a
               gag factory?

                               DOLORES
               Got me.  But unless the will shows up
               by Friday midnight, it's theirs.

     As Valiant considers this new development, he cocks an ear.
     In the distance, we HEAR FAINT SINGING.

                               VALIANT
               What's that comin' from the bar?

                               DOLORES
                      (listens)
               Sounds like singin'.

                               VALIANT
               Oh, no...

     As Valiant grabs his pants...

                                              CUT TO:


     INT. TERMINAL BAR - DAY

     Roger's out all right.  In fact, he's using the bar as a
     stage for a song and dance number.  The tune is extremely
     familiar.  In fact, it's the one that opens every Warner
     Brothers cartoon...  The Looney Tune Anthem.  But we've never
     heard words to go with it.

                               ROGER RAB3IT
               'The merry-go-round broke down
               But you don't see me frown...'

     Roger grabs Augie's pad and pencil, scribbles some drawings
     lightning fast.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               'Things turned out fine
               And now she's mine...'

     Roger flips through the pad which in crude animation, shows
     the story of Roger and Jessica getting back together,
     culminating in them kissing in a heart.  Augie's delighted.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               '... Cause the merry-go-round
               Went round...
               Hoo-hoo, Hoo-hoo...'

     Roger does backflips and acts like an escapee from the acute
     ward.


     THE DOOR OPENS

     Eddie and Dolores enter.  Valiant stops in his tracks at the
     sight of Roger's performance... and the smiles on the faces
     of the sourpusses.


     CLOSE - ROGER

     doesn't see Eddie.  He moves into the next verse.  He twirls
     around on the post.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               'My name is Roger Rabbit
               I've got a crazy habit
               I like to sing and dance and yuk...'

     Roger goes to Angelo, lifts off his cap, and whacks his
     toupee, making it spin like a top.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               '... So brighten up and smile
               You schmuck'.

     All the regulars in the bar have a good laugh at that one.
     Now as Roger twirls around on the post, he smashes into a bar
     tray held by Eddie.  Valiant carries him toward the back
     room, but the irrepressable entertainer gets on his knees Al
     Jolson style and blows kisses to his audience.  The regulars
     are HOWLING as Roger is carried out.


     INT. BACK ROOM

     Valiant flings Roger into the room and slams the door behind
     him.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hey, don't I get an encore?

                               VALIANT
               Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out
               there riskin' my neck for you.   I come
               back here and you're singin' and
               dancin'.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               But that's my calling, my purpose, my
               raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to
               make people laugh... and believe me,
               those people needed a laugh.

                               VALIANT
               And when they're done laughin' , they're
               gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo
               would rat on you for a nickel!

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...

                               VALIANT
               An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He
               just got outta prison.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well... I still don't think he'd turn
               me in.

                               VALIANT
               Just because you got 'em to laugh?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie.
               Sometimes it's the only weapon we have
               in life.

                               VALIANT
               I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson
               variety.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I've met some cynical and miserable
               humans in my time.  But you, Edward
               Valiant, are positively funereal!

                               VALIANT
               Well, right now it's gonna be your
               funereal.

     Valiant takes his fist back to belt Roger.  Roger stands
     stoicly, jaw thrust forward, eyes closed.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Go ahead and throw that punch.
                      (opens one eye)
               But you'd be more successful with a
               punch line.

     Valiant drops his fist and rubs his temples with frustration.

                               VALIANT
               You're driving me crazy, you know that?
               Let's go... you ruined this as a hiding
               place.

     Valiant grabs Roger by the scruff of the neck and opens the
     door.  But he ducks back in quickly.


     VALIANT'S POW - THROUGH DOOR - JUDGE DOOM

     has entered the bar.  He stands FRAMED in the doorway,
     Voltaire perched on his shoulder.  The red light of the neon
     sign flashes on his glasses making him look like he's got
     burning coals for eyes.  With the Weasles at the door backing
     him up, the satanic Doom walks to the bar, his FOOTSTEPS
     CREAKING along the wooden floor.  He surveys the scene, leans
     over the bar for a glass.  Doom holds the glass up to the
     light and looks at it disgustedly.  He picks up a bottle of
     scotch and carries it down to where the one-armed Soldier is
     sitting.  Doom stares at him, then pulls the empty sleeve out
     of the amputee's pocket.  He uses it to wipe the inside of
     the glass.

                               DOOM
               I'm looking for a rabbit.  He was last
               seen in this neighborhood.

     The barflies avoid Doom's stare and shoot covered glances to
     one another.  But nobody says a word.  Doom pours a drink
     into his newly cleaned glass... then gently pours it down
     Voltaire's gullet.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               You couldn't miss him.  Buck teeth.
               Orange pants.  About yea big.

     Doom squashes the Midget's head down to approximate the size.

                               DOLORES
               There's no rabbit here, so don't harass
               my customers.

     Doom turns to Dolores.

                               DOOM
               I didn't come here to harass.  I came
               here to reward.

     Doom walks around Dolores toward the back.  But Doom stops
     next to the blackboard.  On it is written:  "Today's Special
     - French Dip - $ .50".  Doom erases the "French" and the
     decimal point in front of the "50".  Then he picks up the
     chalk and starts to write.  The CHALK SQUEAKS excruciatingly
     on the blackboard.  Everyone winces but watches anyway, as
     Doom writes "Rabbit" where the "French" was, and adds the
     zeroes to the "50".  It now reads:  "Rabbit Dip - $5000".


     AT THE BAR - ALL EYES

     are fixed on the figure on the blackboard.  Angelo licks his
     lips.

                               ANGELO
               Hey, I seen a rabbit...

     Angelo looks defensively at all his cronies and back to Doom.

                               ANGELO
                      (continuing)
               He's right here in the bar.

     But instead of pointing to the back of the bar, he talks to
     the empty barstool beside him.

                               ANGELO
                      (continuing)
               Say 'ello, Harvey.

     The tension is broken.  Everybody at the bar starts HOWLING.


     INT. BACK ROOM

     Roger turns to Eddie victoriously.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               My pal.


     IN THE BAR

     Doom stares down the regulars until the laughter stops.
     Meanwhile, a Weasle has started sniffing around the bar where
     Roger was dancing.  As Doom turns to leave, the Weasle
     whispers in his ear as he points to the back.  Doom smiles
     and pats the Weasle on the head.  He turns to Angelo and the
     others.

                                        DOOM
                Now we'll see who laughs best...

     The Weasle bloodhounds through the bar with Doom striding
     after him.  We FOLLOW them to the door to the back room.
     Doom rips the door open.


     INT. BACK ROON

     It's dark.  Doom flicks on the light.  REVEAL Valiant on the
     cot, his pint bottle cradled in his arm.  He blinks as if
     awakened from a drunken slumber.

                               DOOM
               Valiant?  Why is it that whenever my
               men smell a rabbit, you're there?

     Valiant plumps the pillow behind his head.

                               VALIANT
               Must be my cologne... Eau Dc Carrot.

                               WEASLE #1
                      (sniffs)
               He's in here all right, boss.

     Suddenly the Weasle grabs the pillow from under Valiant's
     head and carves it to shreds with a switchblade.  Feathers
     fly.  But no rabbit fur.

                               WEASLE #2
               Youse want we should take the place
               apart?

     The rest of the Weasles are arrayed behind Doom with Toon
     crowbars, picks, and a jackhammer.

                               DOOM
               No, Sergeant.  That won't be necessary.

     Doom walks over to the locker.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               I know a trick that no Toon can resist.

     Doom raps on the locker with his knuckles.  Da-da-da-da-da...
     It's a familiar pattern that demands a Da-da response.  Doom
     moves to the desk and tries it again.  Da-da-da-da-da...


     INSIDE A MAXWELL HOUSE COFFEE CAN

     Roger is hiding while sweating out the urge to finish the
     familiar coda.  We HEAR the RAPPING again, closer.
     Da-da-da-da-da...  Roger's biting his nails.


     DOOM

     moves to the milk crate the coffee can is on.  Valiant gets
     up off the cot.

                               VALIANT
               You know, Doom, I don't know who's
               Toonier, you or the rabbit.

     Doom just smiles and knocks the pattern out on the crate.

                               DOOM
               Shave... and... a haircut...

     Roger bursts out of the can with the lid on his head.  He
     responds con brio.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Two... bits!
                      (looks around)
               Uh... oh...

     PSSSHEW!  Roger flies out the door.


     INT. THE BAR

     He streaks across the bar and out the front door.   After a
     beat, two Weasles step into the bar holding the butterfly net
     they had stretched across the door.  They WHEEZE with glee at
     the struggling Roger trapped inside.  A third Weasle carries
     the Judge's briefcase.

     Doom strides confidently into the bar.

                               WEASLE
               Oyez... oyez... oyez... court is now in
               session.

     Valiant and Dolores are led out by a couple Weasles holding
     guns on them.  As Doom snaps the briefcase open on the bar,
     the twelve Kangaroos pop up in their jury box.  Doom raps on
     the bar with his gavel-headed cane.  The regulars watch the
     bizarre scene in stunned silence.

                               DOOM
               Roger Rabbit is charged with the cold
               blooded murder of a human... Marvin
               Acme.  The jury will direct their
               attention to exhibits A, B, and C.

     The Weasles display photographs of Jessica and Acme playing
     pattycake, a blow-up of his fingerprints spelling
     RogerRabbitRogerRabbit in the whorls on the photographs, and
     a picture of Acme lying under the safe.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Motive, evidence, modus operandi.  How
               do you find the defendant?

     Once again the Kangaroo court wastes no time delivering the
     verdict.  The Baby Kangaroos pop up with their Y-O-U A-R-E
     G-U-I-L-T-Y signs.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Guilty as charged.  Case closed!

     Doom slams the briefcase shut.  Now two Weasles wheel the
     stainless steel tub filled with dip into the bar.  Another
     hands Doom his black rubber gloves.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               For this heinous crime, I sentence you
               to the dip!

                               ROGER RABBIT
               No, no. not the dip!  Eddie, tell him
               I didn't do it!

                               VALIANT
               I don't think it's gonna matter.
               Sorry, pal, I tried.

                               DOOM
               Yes, and for that you're charged with
               aiding and abetting.  But we'll let
               Santino handle that.

     Doom pulls on the rubber gloves.

                               VALIANT
               Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last
               request?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs?
               Just kidding.

                               VALIANT
               I think you want a drink.
                      (to Doom)
               How about it, Judge?

                               DOOM
               Well, why not?  I'm feeling magnanimous
               tonight.  The successful conclusion of
               this case draws the curtain on my
               career as a jurist. I'm retiring to
               take a new role in the private sector.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah?  Well, don't expect the Toons to
               give you a gold watch.

     Valiant pours a glass of whiskey filling it all the way to
     the rim.  He holds it out to Roger.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper
               for me.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               But, Eddie, you know what happens
               when...

                               VALIANT
               Drink it, jerk.  All of it.

     He grabs Roger's hand and forces the drink into it.  Roger
     shrugs his shoulders and shoots the drink down.  We've seen
     the reaction before.  Suddenly Roger's head turns into a
     STEAM WHISTLE emitting such a PIERCING BLAST that is sends
     everyone into ear-grabbing agony.  Glasses, bottles, mirrors,
     even Doom's glasses SHATTER.  Valiant uses the distraction to
     punch the Weasles holding Roger.  He grabs the rabbit by the
     scruff of the neck. He gets as assist from Augie, who
     couldn't hear the noise.  Unfazed, Augie whacks a Weasle on
     the head with a barstool.  The Midget crawls behind Doom,
     who's been momentarily blinded.  The one-armed Soldier pushes
     him over.  Angelo is turning one Weasle's head around and
     around like a cruller.  Finally, Doom gets to his feet.

                               DOOM
               After them you fools...

     As the Weasles regroup, Valiant tips the stainless steel tub
     over sending the dip spilling toward them.  The Weasles
     recoil from the liquid.  Even Doom takes a step backward.


     EXT. TERMINAL BAR

     Eddie and Roger race down the stairs and toward the Toon
     Control Wagon which is parked in front of Doom's Lincoln,

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'.
               Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the
               noodle, the grey matter...

                               VALIANT
               If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin'
               from the law with a Toon?

     Valiant opens the door of the Toon Control wagon, and flings
     Roger inside roughly.


     INT. CAB

     Eddie goes to start the vehicle but the key is gone.   Now
     from behind them comes a DEEP RUMBLING VOICE somewhere
     between Lord Buckley and Barry White.

                               VOICE
               Excuse me, gentlemen...

     Eddie and Roger turn.  A snazzy TOON ROADSTER whose grill
     functions as it's mouth is talking from behind the liquid
     bars.

                               ROADSTER
                   If you effect my extrication, I
                   could offer you some carburetion.

     Valiant sighs with resignation and slides out of the cab,
     Roger in tow.


     EXT. REAR OF WAGON

     Eddie and Roger come racing around the side of the wagon.
     Valiant searches the back of the truck for the on/off switch.
     He finds it and turns off the flow of acetone.  The Roadster
     zips out of the truck and lands on the pavement, already
     flexing and limbering.   Behind him, a comical number of other
     TOON DETAINEES hop out like midgets out of a Volkswagon.

     They all head for the hills.

                               ROADSTER
               Well... what're we waitin' for, the
               William Tell Overture?


     ANGLE ON TERMINAL BAR - THE WEASLES

     come piling out.  They stack up like an Indian totem pole
     searching every direction.  One of them spots Eddie and
     Roger.  The Weasles stumble all over themselves in a mad
     scramble down the stairs.


     EDDIE AND ROGER

     hop into the sleek two-seater.   Valiant looks at the myriad
     of goofy cartoon gauges and switches on the Roadster's
     dashboard.

                               VALIANT
               What do I do?

                               ROADSTER
               You don't have to do nothin'...

     With a ferocious RUBBER BURNING SQUEAL, the Roadster ROARS
     off in "no frames".  The exit is so fast that Eddie and Roger
     are left behind, hanging mid-air.  But before they hit the
     ground, the Roadster zips back INTO FRAME.  Eddie and Roger
     fall back into their seats.  The Roadster bends around so his
     grill is facing them.

                               ROADSTER
                      (continuing)
               Uh... except hang onto your hat.

     The Roadster ROARS off again in a cloud of Toon dust.


     INT. SANTINO'S COP CAR

     coming the other way.  It's followed by another squad car,
     both with SIRENS BLARING.  When the red blur streaks by, Lt.
     Santino turns to his PARTNER.

                               LT. SANTINO
               What the hell was that?

                               PARTNER
               Speeding rabbit, Lieutenant.

                               LT. SANTINO
               That's what I was afraid of.


     EXT. STREET

     Santino's car does a 180 degree spin, and goes after the
     Roadster.  The second squad car follows.  The Weasles pile
     into the Toon Control wagon and join the chase.


     INT. THE ROADSTER

     rockets down the street, then takes a turn so wide that it
     drives up the front of the corner building, then back down on
     the sidewalk, just avoiding a newsstand.  The squad car
     following is not so dexterous.   It CRASHES into the stand,
     sending newspapers flying.


     THE ROADSTER

     looks back over it's shoulder, admiring his handiwork.

                               ROADSTER
               Read all about it, Benny's back in
               town!

     Up ahead, an egg delivery truck is double-parked in their
     lane.  Benny snaps around just as they're about to crash into
     the back of the truck.  There's nowhere to go.   But Benny's
     cool.

                               ROADSTER
               Going up...

     Suddenly, just before impact, the Toon suspension on the car
     accordions up, giving it a clearance of about fifteen feet...
     just enough to get over the truck.


     THE TOON CONTROL WAGON

     doesn't come with this unique feature.  It tries to avoid the
     truck but SMASHES into the back, splattering hundreds of eggs
     and sending the Weasles flying.


     EDDIE AND ROGER

     look down from their suspended position at the chaos behind.

                               ROADSTER
               Next floor, sundries, knick knacks,
               escaped convicts.  Watch your step.

     The Roadster accordions back down to it's original height and
     speeds past TWO MOTORCYCLE COPS.  The motorcycles ROAR after
     them.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hey, Benny, what were you in for?

                               ROADSTER
               Reckless driving.  Do you believe that?

                               VALIANT
               Hard to imagine.

     Benny zig-zags through traffic, scooting between cars, but
     the Motorcycle Cops manage to stay on his tail.  Up ahead,
     traffic is stopped in his lane.  With nowhere to go, Benny
     passes a trolley car moving down the center of the street.
     Suddenly, he swerves in front of the trolley to elude the
     Cops... only to see another Red Car coming the other way.

                               ROADSTER
               Hold your breath, babies...

     Benny sucks in his girth and gets on his tip-toes as the
     trollies pass on either side of them.


     WIDE SHOT

     When the trollies clear, Benny staggers out from between them
     still on tip-toes.  Benny plops down, squashes, then pops up
     to his old self again.


     BEHIND THEM

     The crippled Toon Control wagon is struggling to keep up.
     Voltaire circles above the truck and picks two Weasles up off
     the roof.  They're each carrying several sticks of dynamite.


     FROM THE AIR

     We see Voltaire flying after the Roadster, which is speeding
     along the palm-lined Elysian Park Drive.  The Weasles light
     the dynamite sticks and with WHEEZING delight, bombard the
     car below.


     BENNY

     swerves right and left dodging the EXPLOSIONS.  Now a stick
     of dynamite falls into the back seat, fuse burning.  Benny
     looks back.

                               ROADSTER
               Hate to sound like Chicken Little, but
               is the sky falling or what?

     Eddie and Roger turn to see the dynamite, fuse burning low.
     Valiant makes a desperate grab for it.  But it rolls under
     the front seat.  Roger jumps in Eddie's lap.


     ABOVE - VOLTAIRE AND THE WEASLES

     satisfied that they've hit their target, swoop back to the
     Toon Control wagon.


     IN THE ROADSTER

     Valiant tries to untangle himself from Roger.

                               VALIANT
               Grab it, you idiot!

     Finally, at the last second, Roger reaches down and picks the
     dynamite up like a hot potato.  He flips it out of the
     Roadster.


     THE DYNAMITE

     spins through the air, finally landing on the roof just as
     Voltaire and the Weasles arrive.  BOOM!  The Toon Control
     wagon is demolished.  When the smoke clears we see the
     Weasles and Voltaire scattered roadside, faces blackened,
     feathers smoking.


     EXT. ECHO PARK STREET

     Benny is leading a merry chase up and down the hills.  Beside
     the two Motorcycles, there are half a dozen squad cars.  But
     as Benny comes over the last rise, we see the road deadends
     at Echo Park Lake.  The police have blocked off the
     perpendicular streets with squad cars.  Eddie and Roger see
     the deadend fast approaching.  Roger covers his eyes with his
     ears.  Valiant braces himself.

                               VALIANT
               The brakes!  The brakes!

     Benny hits the brakes.  Smoke pours out as they burn up and
     the momentum is barely broken.

                               ROADSTER
               Forget the brakes, who brought the
               water wings?

     The Roadster SMASHES through the wooden guard rail and sails
     out over the water.  KERPLOP!  It splashes down in the lake.


     THE POLICE CARS

     SCREECH to a stop at the edge of the lake.  Santino jumps out
     and regards the floating Roadster.  He turns to the other
     cops with a smirk.  When he turns back again, the smirk
     disappears from his face.


     ANGLE ON LAKE

     Benny is calmly swimming away using his fenders to do the
     crawl.  Now they pass a spooning COUPLE in a rowboat.  The
     couple regard them open-mouthed.


     THE EDGE OF THE LAKE

     Benny nears the shoreline, touches bottom and wades out.
     When they hit dry land, Benny shakes off like a dog.  He REVS
     HIS ENGINE.

                               ROADSTER
               Maybe it's my imagination, but I always
               seem to run better after I've had a
               wash.
                     (turns)
               Now where can I drop you cats?

     As Benny ROARS off...

                                              CUT TO:


     EXT. ALLEY - DAY

     Benny peeks around the corner, then tip-toes into view. down
     the alley until he stops in front of a back door.  Eddie and
     Roger climb out.

                               VALIANT
               Thanks, Benny.

                               ROADSTER
               If you ever need me, just stick out
               your thumb.

     WHOOSH!  Benny is gone.  Valiant goes to the door and unlocks
     it.  As he and Roger head up the back stairs...

                                              CUT TO:


     INT. BUILDING - CLOSE - DOORWAY

     A hand painted design on the rippled glass shows a knight on
     a white charger.  On the shield in bold letters it says,
     "Veritas".  And lettered around it -- "Valiant and Valiant -
     Private Investigation".


     VALIANT

     sticks his key in the door and unlocks it.  Roger studies the
     banner.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other
                Valiant?

                               VALIANT
                My brother.  Get inside.

     He pushes Roger into the office.


     INT. OFFICE

     It's a typical detective office -- a couch, a sink, a window
     -- except for the partner's desk in the middle of the room.
     There's a chair on each side.  Valiant closes the door and
     locks it.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                So what's our plan, our scenario, our
                modus operandi?

                               VALIANT
                We can't do anything till it's dark.

     Valiant picks up some yellowed newspapers off the couch and
     dumps them on the floor.  They leave a clean spot on the
     couch.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Guess you haven't been here in a while.
                     (reads
                      headline)
                'Japs Bomb Pearl Harbor'.

     Roger walks over to the wall.  He takes a framed picture off
     the wall which shows two guys clowning with Mickey Mouse.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Say, who's this guy laughin'?

                               VALIANT
                Me.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've
                never seen you laugh before.  That your
                brother makin' the rabbit ears?

                               VALIANT
                What is this, Twenty Questions?

     Valiant grabs the picture from Roger and re-hangs it.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
                I'm gonna get some sleep.  I suggest
                you do the same.
         
     Valiant stretches out on the couch.  Roger nudges him to move
     over so he can lie down.  Grudgingly, Valiant slides over a
     fraction giving Roger a tiny piece of the couch.  They lie
     head to foot.


     CLOSEUP - VALIANT

     The problems of the day are knitting his brow.  Finally his
     eyes close.  After a beat, we HEAR Roger SNORING.  It's LOUD.
     Valiant's eyes pop open.  He rolls over.  WIDEN THE SHOT to
     see what he sees.


     ABOVE ROGER'S HEAD - A TOON DREAM BUBBLE

     has appeared.  Inside the bubble is a saw sawing back and
     forth through a log.  It is SYNCHRONIZED to the SOUND of
     Roger's SNORE.  Valiant kicks Roger, trying to stop the
     infernal SOUND.

     Roger sits up.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Huh?

     In the dream bubble, the saw cuts through the log.  One end
     of the log falls out of the bubble and BONKS Roger on the
     head, knocking him unconscious.  Valiant shakes his head and
     closes his eyes again.  We PAN UP off his face and PAST the
     window where the sun is setting.  As the CAMERA MOVES ALONG
     THE WALL, we see a gallery of framed newspaper clippings.
     "Valiant and Valiant Crack Popeye Kidnapping - Return Sweepea
     to Loving Arms of Parents".  And... "Brothers Find Brothers:
     Heckle and Jeckle Rescued From Redwood Forest!"  And...
     "Goofy Cleared of Atomic Spying Charges".  The PAN CONTINUES
     until we get to the window again.  Now it's dark outside.
     MOVE DOWN to Valiant's sleeping face.  He stirs. then opens
     one eye.  Now they both pop open at what he sees.


     VALIANT'S POV

     Roger has a magnifying glass an inch in front of his face
     that distorts his grinning face hideously.


     VALIANT

     startled from his sleep, reflexively shoves Roger away from
     him.  He flies into a swivel chair and goes spinning around.

                               VALIANT
                You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked
                you for the patsy.  Always gotta play
                the fool.  You make me sick!

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience,
                but what happened to you that was so
                dark, lurid, embittering?

                               VALIANT
                You wanna know?  Well, since you're so
                goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of
                you Toons killed my brother.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                A Toon?  Noooo.

                               VALIANT
                Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who
                killed Bambi's mother.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous,
                despicable... a smear on the drafting
                board.

                               VALIANT
                Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and
                Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All
                Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em.
                And when this guy was accused of
                knockin' over the First National Bank
                of Toontown, we took his case.  But
                when we looked into it, we found out he
                did do it after all.  We went to his
                house to take him in.  But he was wise.
                He got the drop on us... literally.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (wincing)
                Safe?
         
                               VALIANT
                Piano.  Guy got away, disappeared into
                Toontown.  Nobody ever saw him again.

     Now the PHONE on the desk RINGS.  Roger makes a move to it.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                I'll get it.

                               VALIANT
                Get away from there.

     The PHONE RINGS TWO MORE TIMES and stops.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Wrong number?

                               VALIANT
                No, it's not.

     Valiant goes to the phone anticipating a RING which comes
     after a moment.  Valiant picks up the receiver.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Dolores?
         
                                              INTERCUT:


     DOLORES

     on the phone in the Terminal Bar.

                               DOLORES
               I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's
               called here about four times.  He says
               he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He
               says he can help you.

                               VALIANT
               I'll bet.

                               DOLORES
               Are you gonna call him, Eddie?

                               VALIANT
               What've I got to lose?  You okay,
               Dolores?

                               DOLORES
               Yeah... they closed me down for a
               coupla weeks.

                               VALIANT
               That'll work out just fine.  When this
               thing is over, I'll take you to
               Catalina.  How does that sound?

                               DOLORES
               Familiar.  Be careful, Eddie.

     Dolores hangs up the phone.

                                              INTERCUT TO:


     VALIANT

     He CLICKS the switchhook and dials.
         
                               VALIANT
               Maroon?  Whaddaya want?

                               MAROON
                      (on phone)
               Have you got the will?

                               VALIANT
               Maybe.  Why?

                               MAROON
                      (on phone)
               Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock.
               If you've got the will maybe we can
               stop this thing.

                               VALIANT
               Stop what?

     CLICK.  Maroon has hung up.  Valiant hangs up the phone and
     goes to a wall safe.  He spins the combination.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are
               ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine
               o'clock.

                               VALIANT
               That's why I'll be there at 8:45.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I tell you what, maybe I better come
               with you.

                               VALIANT
               Forget it.

     Valiant reaches into the safe for a .38 revolver.  He checks
     the cylinder. Then he takes out a wooden box about 8" X 12".
     He closes the safe, picks up a black doctor's bag and puts
     the box and the revolver into it.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a
               chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you
               think.

                               VALIANT
               How much is a shave and a haircut,
               Roger?

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (sheepish)
               Two bits.

                               VALIANT
               I rest my case.

     Valiant goes to the door, pauses.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               If I don't make it back here by ten...

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Yeah?

                               VALIANT
               ... I'd head for Cucamonga.

     Valiant closes the door, leaving Roger alone.  Roger paces
     back and forth manically.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Cucamonga?  I don't know anybody in
               Cucamonga.


     EXT. MAROON STUDIO - NIGHT

     The lot is dark and deserted.  Now headlights cut through the
     darkness as Maroon's Packard pulls up in front of the
     Administration building.


     INT. CAR - MAROON

     reaches over and opens the glove compartment.  He takes out a
     small automatic.  But his hands are so slippery with
     perspiration, it falls to the floor.  Cursing, he takes out
     a handkerchief, wipes his hands and his face and picks up the
     gun again.  As he gets out of the car, we see the clock says
     8:55.


     INT. ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - NIGHT

     Maroon hustles up to his office door.  He looks nervously
     over his shoulder, then goes inside.


     INT. MAROON'S OFFICE

     Maroon switches on the lights.  He goes to his desk.  He
     takes out the gun and puts it in the left hand drawer.  Then
     he takes it out and puts it in the right hand drawer.  Then
     back to the original drawer.  Finally satisfied, he goes to
     the bar to calm his obviously shattered nerves.  As his
     shakey hand starts to pour from the decanter, another hand
     comes INTO FRAME.

                               VALIANT
               Steady, R.K., that stuff's eighteen
               years old.

     Maroon jumps back as Valiant steps from behind the curtain,
     holding his black bag.

                               MAROON
               Valiant!  You surprised me.

                               VALIANT
               That was the idea.

     Valiant takes over the pouring duties.  He turns and carries
     Maroon's drink to him.  Maroon goes and sits down in his
     chair.  He looks to the pistol hiding place.  Valiant
     casually sits on the desk, putting his legs over the drawer.

                               VALIANT
               You're not too good at this, are you,
               R.K.?

                               MAROON
               No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker,
               not a murderer.

                               VALIANT
               Well, everybody needs a hobby.

                               MAROON
               No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I
               had nothin' to do with Acme gettin'
               killed.  I just wanted to sell my
               studio.  But they wouldn't buy my
               property unless Acme would sell his.
               And he wouldn't.  So I was gonna
               blackmail Acme with pictures of him and
               the rabbit's wife.

     Maroon gets up from his chair, highly agitated.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               But then it all went to hell.  I been
               around Toons all my life.  I can't sit
               around and see them all destroyed.

     Maroon eyes Valiant's black bag.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               You got the will in there, don't ya?

                               VALIANT
               No, I don't.

                               MAROON
               You tricked me, damn you!

                               VALIANT
               Take it easy.

                               MAROON
               There's no time to take it easy!  You
               don't realize the diabolical mind we're
               dealing with!


     ANGLE ON WINDOW

     A gun pokes through the open window past the curtain.  It's a
     Colt .45 Buntline -- an unmistakeable gun with an extra long
     barrel.

                               MAROON
               If I don't get that will by midnight
               tonight, Toontown's just gonna be land
               for the free...


     VALIANT

     sees a reflection of the gun on the glass on a movie poster
     on the wall.  He turns.  But it's too late.  BANG!  BANG!
     BANG!  Maroon crumples, caught mid-sentence.  Valiant dives
     behind the desk and draws his gun.  He looks over at Maroon's
     dead body on the floor.

                               VALIANT
               And the home of the brave?

     Valiant crawls to the window where the shots came from.  He
     looks out.


     VALIANT'S POV

     The comely silhouette of Jessica Rabbit runs to her car,
     jumps in and ROARS out the the studio gates.


     VALIANT

     grabs his black bag, climbs out of the office window and
     jumps off the fire escape to the lot below.


     EXT. STUDIO LOT

     Valiant hops into Maroon's Packard.  He hits the starter
     button and takes off after Jessica.


     NEW ANGLE

     as the car pulls away, the trunk lid lifts.  Roger Rabbit
     peers out, disoriented.  Then closes it.


     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     Jessica's car speeds along.  Valiant is in close pursuit in
     the Packard.  He's about to catch up on the straightaway when
     Jessica's car disappears into a tunnel.


     VALIANT

     slams on his brakes.  The Packard goes fishtailing, finally
     spinning to a stop at the foot of the "Toontown" sign.

     Valiant gets out of the car.  He looks down the tunnel.  He's
     sweating.  He loosens his necktie.  He paces back and forth
     at the tunnel mouth.  He looks up at the Toontown sign and
     suddenly smashes it with his fist.  It spins around like a
     weathervane.

     Valiant walks to the Packard with purpose.  He grabs the
     black bag and puts it on the hood.  He opens it and takes out
     the wooden box.


     CLOSE - BOX

     as the clasp is popped and the box opened, REVEAL a stunning
     presentation model TOON .38 resting on crushed velvet.  It's
     everything a real gun could be... and more.  Each feature is
     exaggerated... the barrel, the cylinder, the ivory grips are
     all Toon-sized.


     VALIANT

     picks the gun up and hefts it respectfully.  Then he opens an
     ammo section in the wooden box. SIX TOON .38 DUM-DUM BULLETS
     are in velvet creases.  The Toon Bullets blink to life as if
     awakening from a long sleep.

                               DUM-DUM #l
                      (rubbing eyes)
               Eddie... is that really you?

                               VALIANT
               Uh-huh.

                               DUM-DUM #2
               What year is it?

                               VALIANT
               '46.

                               DUM-DUM #3
               Who won the war?

                               DUM-DUM #4
               Who do you think, dummy?

                               DUM-DUM #5
               Welcome back, Eddie.

                               DUM-DUM #6
               Where you been the last five years?

                               VALIANT
               Drunk.

     He opens the cylinder.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Feelin' frisky tonight, boys?

                               DUM-DUMS
               Yeah!

     The Bullets eagerly dive into their respective chambers.  He
     snaps the cylinder closed, reaches into his shoulder holster
     and takes out the pint bottle.  He unscrews the cap and pours
     the rest of the booze onto the ground.  When it's drained, he
     flings the bottle in the air and FIRES the Toon .38.  KA-POW!
     It makes a SOUND like a CANNON.


     THE TOON BULLET

     climbs like a rocket into the dark sky.  It SCREECHES up to
     the bottle, puts on the brakes.  The Bullet puts on a
     jeweler's eyepiece, then it whips out a little hammer and
     chisel acd delivers one delicate tap.


     VALIANT

     watches as a cut glass chandelier falls out of the sky and
     CRASHES at his feet.  Valiant holsters his weapon and climbs
     into the Packard.  He puts it in gear and pulls into the
     tunnel.


     IN THE TUNNEL - DRIVING

     As Valiant heads toward the proverbial light at the end of
     the tunnel, suddenly the CAR RADIO COMES ON.

                               RADIO ANNOUNCER
               ... From the tippy tip top of
               Toontown's Tip Top Club, this is Mellow
               Melody Matinee.  Here's our favorite
               cricket, Jimmy, with 'Give A Little
               Whistle'.

                               JIMINY CRICKET
                      (on radio)
               'When you get in trouble, and you don't
               know right from wrong...'

     Valiant turns the on/off switch, then punches all the buttons
     but to no avail.  The SONG PLAYS ON anyway.

                               JIMINY CRICKET
                      (continuing)
               '... Give a little whistle
               Give a little whistle...'

                               VALIANT
               I hate Toontown...

     As Jimmy croons on, Valiant emerges from the tunnel.


     VALIANT'S FOV

     Through the windshield we see we have arrived in Toontown,
     where it's a beautiful sunny day.  Eddie is now driving down
     a phantasmagorical boulevard in a completely animated world.
     It's a Max Fleischer version of a city neighborhood.  The
     trees and buildings are swaying in time with the MUSIC.
     Eddie looks to his left and sees a huge Aphrodite-like hood
     ornament on the front of a TOON CAR.  Then as the car starts
     to pass him he sees hood... hood... hood... more hood then a
     CHAUFFEUR, then more car, and finally the Wolf we remember
     from the Ink & Paint Club.  He's in top hat and tails, a TOON
     LAMB in the passenger seat.  He tips his hat.

                               WOLF
               Helloooo, cousin.

     Now he drives past a Toon building under construction.  Like
     everything else in Toontown. the construction company sports
     the name "Acme".  The sign out frontsays:  WATCH OUR
     PROGRESS.  Eddie looks up, and before he can drive by, the
     building gets built floor by floor with accompanying SFX in
     about two seconds.

     Up ahead, the street is clear for blocks.  Then suddenly cars
     pour out of all side streets at once, clogging the boulevard
     like arteriosclerosis.  There is mad HONKING in this cartoon
     traffic jam.  Eddie shakes his head.  He pulls over, parks
     and gets out.

     Valiant pulls out his Toon .38.  Suddenly, the street empties
     in the blink of an eye.  Shutters close, and the sidewalk
     rolls up like window shades.  It's so quiet you could hear a
     pin drop.  In fact, a PIN DROPS from a second story window,
     landing with the CLANG! of a manhole cover.  All is quiet
     again.  Valiant starts across the street -- there is a CREAK
     behind him.  Valiant whirls around, levelling his pistol at
     the sound.


     ANGLE ON PACKARD - ROGER

     peeks out of the trunk of Maroon's car.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Don't shoot, Eddie.  It's me.

     Valiant lowers the gun as Roger emerges.

                               VALIANT
               What the hell are you doin' in there?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I followed you to the Maroon Studios.
               When I heard those shots, I thought I'd
               help you and investigate the inside of
               this trunk.

     Valiant reaches into the black bag in the car.  He comes out
     with a pair of TOON HANDCUFFS.  He slaps one on Roger's
     wrist.

                               ROGER RA13BIT
                      (continuing)
               Hey, what're you doin'?

     Valiant drags Roger to the steering wheel.

                               VALIANT
               I'm making sure you don't help me
               anymore.

     He locks the cuff to it, and heads across the street.


     AROUND THE CORNER - VALIANT

     stops at a street sign.  The post is bristling with fingers
     pointing in different directions; i.e., Poughkeepsie,
     Transylvania, Walla Walla, South Pole (the finger points down
     of course), and finally a finger which says:  The Dame.
     Eddie follows the finger down the side street to a high rise
     building.

     He catches a glimpse of Jessica darting into the elevators.
     Valiant hustles inside after her.

     Valiant goes to the elevators, and watches the floor
     indicator spinning round and Round, finally stopping with a
     BING at the 125th floor.  The elevator doors open and Valiant
     steps on.


     IN THE ELEVATOR

     Valiant punches 125.  Suddenly the elevator takes out with
     such velocity that Valiant is thrown to the floor.  After a
     moment, it stops so fast that he hits the ceiling.  Then
     bounces back to the floor as the doors open.  He picks
     himself up and steps off the elevator.

     He's in a foyer with four doors.  Valiant opens the first and
     steps inside.  He disappears.


     NEW ANGLE

     Valiant is on the outside of the building hanging onto a
     flagpole for dear life.  He looks down at the street which
     looks miles below.  Valiant inches back along the flagpole to
     the door and pulls himself to safety.


     INSIDE - VALIANT

     tries the next door.  This time more carefully.  A SPEEDING
     TRAIN is coming right at him.  He slams the door.  He tries
     the next one.  A homely OLD TOON LADY is in a bathtub.  She
     lets out a BLOODCURDLING SCREAM.  Valiant closes that door
     quickly, and turns to the last.  When he opens this one, we
     HEAR FOREBODING MUSIC.  We see...


     A DARK ALLEY

     Warily, Valiant walks into the alley, gun drawn.  There's a
     NOISE behind the garbage cans.  Valiant turns as a DEAD BODY
     with a knife in his back falls out of the shadows at
     Valiant's feet.  A SQUEAKY VOICE comes from behind Valiant.

                               VOICE
               I guess they didn't clean up after the
               last moider.

     Valiant whips around to see a TOON RAT perched on a skull
     picking his teeth.  Valiant kicks the skull.  The rat
     scrambles for cover.

     As Valiant continues on, we see...


     JESSICA RABBIT

     Steps out of the shadows behind him and aim the gun at his
     back.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Don't move, Valiant.

     Valiant turns slowly to see Jessica's got a bead on him with
     her revolver.

                               VALIANT
               Well... I always figured I'd get it in
               Toontown.

     BLAM!  She fires.  But Valiant's still standing.  We HEAR a
     CRASH behind Eddie as a figure falls into some boxes from a
     fire escape above.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               I think I got him.

     Jessica runs past Valiant to the figure.  He follows,
     bewildered.


     ANGLE ON GROUND

     We can see two rabbit ears sticking out from behind a box

                               VALIANT
               You shot Roger.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's
               men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.

     Jessica moves the box aside and tugs on the rabbit ears.  The
     rabbit head pops off.  Underneath is a Weasle.  In his hand
     is the Colt .45 Buntline.

                               VALIANT
               Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Don't worry, you're not the first.  We
               better get out of here.

     As they run down the alley...

                                              CUT TO:


     THE PACKARD - ROGER

     is behind the wheel making ENGINE NOISES like a little kid.
     He pushes all the buttons, windshield wipers, convertible
     top, etcetera, until he accidentally hits the starter button.
     VROOM!  The Packard fires to life.  Roger's startled for a
     moment, but quickly regains his composure.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hmmm... What would be the harm if I
               took her for a spin?

     He throws it into gear.  The Packard bucks into the car in
     front of it.  Then Roger shifts again.  The same process is
     repeated in reverse.  He SMASHES back and forth.  BANG!
     BANG!

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
                Ah... the open road.


     AROUND THE CORNER - EDDIE AND JESSICA

     come racing down the street.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?

                               VALIANT
               Why didn't you tell me?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               I didn't know who I could trust.

                               VALIANT
               We're even.  By the way, I did find
               your husband.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (excited)
               Where is he?

                               VALIANT
               He's right here in the...

     Valiant rounds the corner and points toward the spot where
     the car used to be.  But all that remains is a crumpled
     bumper.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               ... car.

     He shakes his head and looks around for signs of Roger.

                                              INTERCUT TO:


     THE PACKARD

     is careening down Toon streets totally out of control.
     Panicked, Roger is spinning the wheel as if it were a
     motorboat.  He drives in one side of Mother Goose's Shoe and
     out the other, diapers all over the windshield.  Unable to
     see, Roger steers right off the road.  The car hurtles
     through space.  As it starts to fall, we see it's Toon
     Monument Valley.  The Packard passes a promontory on which
     WILE E. COYOTE is perched.  As Roger passes, he waves to the
     Coyote.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hi, Roger Rabbit.  Love your work.

                                              INTERCUT TO:


     EDDIE AND JESSICA

     who are now facing a squad of TEN Toon Control Weasles.  They
     unleash a fusilade of bullets.

     Valiant knocks Jessica to the ground.  The bullets pass
     harmlessly overhead going into the window of the Acme Cheese
     Shop, riddling a round of cheese.  The CHEESEMAKER'S hand
     comes INTO FRAME changing the sign that says "Gouda" to
     "Swiss".

     Valiant rolls and FIRES his Toon .38 Special.  The Toon
     Bullet turns into a cannonball, which rolls down the street
     busting up the Weasle squad like a bowling ball through ten
     pins.

     As Eddie pulls Jessica to her feet, two more Weasles descend
     on them.  They fling Toon knives, which pin Eddie to a wooden
     fence.  Valiant rips one hand free, and BLASTS two shots at
     them.

     The Toon Bullets get to the Weasles, and open their nose
     cones.  Two frying pans emerge and BONK the Weasles on the
     head.

     Jessica starts to pull the knives out, releasing Eddie.

                               VALIANT
               How did you get onto Doom?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Marvin told me.  Doom was after his
               land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he
               brought me his will.

     Valiant sees a Weasle skulking at them with a tommygun.
     BLAM!  Valiant fires at him.  The Weasle ducks back around
     the corner.  But Valiant's Dum-Dum SCREECHES to a stop and
     goes around the corner, too.  We HEAR an EXPLOSION.  The
     Weasle come staggering out and falls in the street.

                               VALIANT
               So where is it?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               When I opened up the blue envelope, all
               that was inside was a blank piece of
               paper.

                               VALIANT
               A joker to the end.

     Now Weasles are coming at them from every direction.  Valiant
     aims the Toon .38 at a Toon tank rolling their way.  But when
     he pulls the trigger, the gun just CLICKS.  Empty.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Looks like our goose is cooked, our
               hash is slung, our fait is accompli...

                               VALIANT
               Lemme guess where you got that from.
               Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see
               in that guy anyway?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               He made me laugh.

     Valiant shakes his head.  Now they are completely surrounded
     by Weasles.  The situation looks bleak.

                               VALIANT
               Well, do you prefer to die this way or
               that way?

     Valiant jerks his thumb indicating the direction behind him.
     Suddenly, there's a rubber-burning SCREECH as Benny the
     Roadster arrives next to Valiant's hitchhiker-posed thumb.

                               ROADSTER
               Need a lift?

     Valiant does a take.

                               VALIANT
               Benny.

     The Roadster looks back approvingly as Jessica climbs in with
     Eddie.

                               ROADSTER
               Mr. Valiant, you've made a vast
               improvement in the company you keep.

     Benny blasts through a couple of Weasles.  They swing back
     and forth like tavern doors, then topple.

     He takes a hard right into the next block which is the Toon
     Arctic.  His tires turn into skis.  He slaloms back and forth
     between trees.  The Weasles pursue on dogsled.

     Benny grabs a striped barber's pole -- the North Pole -- and
     slides down it.  They land in the Toon Sahara.  Benny crawls
     up a large sand dune, his tongue hanging out of his radiator.
     He glances back at the Weasles who are mounted on camels,
     waving scimitars.  When they reach the top of the sand dune,
     we see they're on the precipice of a bottomless chasm.

                               ROADSTER
               Look, the drawbridge -- we're gonna
               make it.

                               VALIANT
               I don't see any bridge.

                               ROADSTER
               That's because you gotta draw it first.

     Benny takes a pencil hanging from a post lettered "Draw
     Bridge".  He wets the pencil point and in a flash draws a
     bridge.  It's a rickety rope bridge.  Using the pencil as a
     balancing pole, Benny starts to tiptoe across.

     The Weasles jump off t'heir camels and start filing onto the
     bridge after them.

     When Benny finally reaches the other side, Valiant grabs the
     pencil from him and gets out of the car.

                               VALIANT
               Hold on a second.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Eddie, come on.

     But Valiant stands facing the Weasles, who are charging at
     him, swords raised.  With a sly smile, Valiant holds up the
     eraser end of the pencil.  This freezes the Weasles.  But as
     Valiant starts to erase a rope support, the eraser breaks off
     the pencil and falls down into the chasm.  The Weasles WHEEZE
     with relief and advance for the kill.  At the last second,
     Valiant takes the business end of the pencil and scribbles a
     handsaw.  He grabs it by the handle and saws the rope.  The
     bridge swings away, smacking the Weasles into the opposite
     canyon wall.  One by one, they slide off and disappear into
     the abyss.


     VALIANT

     climbs back into Benny.  The Roadster takes off again, making
     a skidding left turn onto the main drag.  As they make their
     break into the Toontown tunnel...


     EXT. TOONTOWN TUNNEL - L.A. SIDE - NIGHT

     A ten gallon drum is sitting by the side of the road under
     the Toontown sign.  From in the tunnel we hear the SOUND of
     Benny's ENGINE coming closer.  Now a foot comes out of the
     shadows and rests on the ten gallon drum.  As the SOUND of
     the ROADSTER gets VERY LOUD, the foot kicks the drum over,
     spilling a clear liquid across the road.


     NEW ANGLE - THE FOOT

     belongs to Judge Doom.  Doom smiles sadistically as the
     Roadster with Eddie and Jessica aboard comes shooting out of
     the tunnel.  When Benny hits the liquid, he starts to skid.

                               ROADSTER
               Uh-oh... whoaaa...!  Look out!

     His tires smoke, then disappear. It's a dip slick.  Without
     tires, Benny spins out of control, finally ending up in the
     bushes roadside.

     Before Eddie and Jessica can make a move, they are surrounded
     by a horde of Weasles pointing what looks like a hundred guns
     at them.

                               DOOM
               Are you two all right?

     Doom opens one of the Roadster's doors and helps Jessica out.
     Valiant climbs out after her.  The Weasles quickly relieve
     him of his Toon pistol.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               These roads can be very treacherous at
               night, especially in a maniacal Toon
               vehicle.

                               VALIANT
               The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.

                               DOOM
               I've had enough of your insolence!
                      (to Weasles)
               Put him in my car.  I think they'll
               enjoy attending our ribbon cutting at
               the Acme factory.

     The Weasles prod Valiant and Jessica into Doom's Lincoln.  A
     Weasle refers to Benny WHIMPERING in the bushes.

                               WEASLE
               What about him?

                               DOOM
               He's not going anywhere.  We'll send
               the mobile unit after him.

     Doom climbs into the car and it zooms off, Weasles jumping
     onto the running boards.


     BENNY

     crawls out of the bushes on his axles.

                               ROADSTER
               The boinin', the boinin'...

     He makes it down into the drainage ditch, dipping his
     tootsies one by one.  There's a HISS as they hit the water
     and the chemicals from the dip are extinguished.

                               ROADSTER
                      (continuing)
               Oh, yeah... that's better.

     Now Benny hears the SOUND of another VEHICLE COMING out of
     the Toontown Tunnel.  He ducks down and peeks over the ditch
     to see...


     ROGER IN THE PACKARD

     come SCREAMING out of the tunnel backwards.  Maroon's Packard
     looks like the winner of a demolition derby.

     Benny stands and waves to him.

                               ROADSTER
               Roger!

     Roger sees him and slams on the brakes, skidding the Packard
     into the Toontown sign.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Benny?

     Benny hobbles over to the Packard.  He pops his trunk and
     rummages around.  He comes out with Toon boltcutters.  He
     clips Roger's cuffs off.

                               ROADSTER
               Doom's got your wife and Valiant.  He
               took them to the Acme factory,

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Let's go!

     Benny nudges Roger to the passenger side.

                               ROADSTER
               Slide over, son.  It looks like you've
               done enough drivin' for tonight.

     Now the Toon Roadster gingerly gets behind the wheel of the
     Packard.  He hits the gas and the Packard lurches down the
     road.


     INT. ACME FACTORY - NIGHT

     Doom's car is parked inside.  There are several other
     vehicles as well.  There's a steamroller, a road grader, and
     a huge modified tanker truck.  It's mounted with a thousand
     gallon vat, the contents of which are being stirred by a
     motorized unit.  All the vehicles are marked with a large
     green four-leaf clover logo.


     VALIANT AND JESSICA

     are held at gunpoint by a couple of Weasles, while several
     others are busy JACKHAMMERING the brick wall at the far end
     of the factory.  Doom pulls on his rubber gloves, turns to
     the Weasles.

                               DOOM
               Frisk them.  See if they have the will.

     Several Weasles rush for the opportunity to frisk Jessica.
     The head Weasle slaps the others away.  Then WHEEZING
     laciviously, he turns to the task.  He starts to move his
     hands over her body when Jessica stomps her heel on his feet.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Get your hands off me, you little
               rodent!

     The Weasle hops away angrily and quickly frisks Valiant.  He
     turns to Doom and shakes his head.

                               DOOM
               No matter.
                      (checks watch)
               I don't expect the will to show up in
               the next fifteen minutes.  By then
               Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite
               legally.

                               VALIANT
               So you're Cloverleaf?

                               DOOM
               No one person is Cloverleaf.  We're a
               vast company with diverse interests...
               gasoline, tires, automobiles.


     AT THE BRICK WALL

     The jackhammering has stopped.  A Weasle plucks one brick out
     of the wall.  Toon light beams through.  He reaches into the
     hole in the wall and comes out holding a bunch of Toon
     bananas.  WHEEZING wickedly, he passes them out to his
     compatriots.  They devour the bananas, throwing the peels
     helter-skelter.


     VALIANT

     turns his attention from the brick wall back to Doom.

                               VALIANT
               Come on, Doom.  What would a company
               like that want with Toontown?

                               DOOM
               It wasn't Toontown they wanted.  It was
               my idea of how to put the land to
               better use.

     Doom goes to the truck and starts turning on valves and
     starting compressors.
                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               In fact, they thought my concept so
               brilliant, that they offered me the
               Directorship of Transportation.  I've
               accepted.
                      (to Weasle)
               Bring me Mr. Valiant's gun.

     The Weasle trots over and delivers Valiant's Toon .38.  Doom
     inspects it.  He reads an engraving on the frame.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               'Thanks for getting me out of the
               hoosegow.  Yosemite Sam'.
                      (looks up)
               How sweet.

     Doom throws the gun on the ground.  He pushes back a long
     lever on the truck, letting loose a tiny spurt of fluid from
     the discharge valve.  The gun disappears.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Dip?

                               DOOM
               That's right.  Enough to dip Toontown
               off the face of the earth.


     EXT. ACME FACTORY - ROGER AND BENNY

     have been watching the proceedings through a window.  They
     turn to each other stunned.

                               BENNY/ROGER RABBIT
               Dip Toontown?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               We gotta do something!

     Roger scurries back to the Packard hidden outside the gates.
     He opens Valiant's black bag and comes out holding Eddie's
     real pistol.  Benny comes tenderfooting up.

                               ROADSTER
               Roger, what're you gonna do with that
               gun?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I'm gonna save them, of course.  You go
               for help.  Find Dolores at the Terminal
               Bar.  She'll know what to do.

                               ROADSTER
               Well... all right...

     Reluctantly, Benny gets behind the wheel of the Packard.

                               ROADSTER
                      (continuing)
               But you be careful now with that gun.
               This ain't no cartoon.

     Benny pulls away.  Roger turns with determination and zips
     back to the window


     INT. FACTORY

     Doom pulls the tarp off the top of the truck, revealing a
     modified water cannon.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               You're sick, Doom.  Where do people
               like you come from?

                               DOOM
               Never mind where I come from.  Just
               watch where I'm going.

                               VALIANT
               Don't you think anyone's gonna notice
               that Toontown's gone?

                               DOOM
               They won't care.  Who's going to miss
               some ridiculous talking mice when they
               can have the future?


     EXT. BACK OF FACTORY - ROGER

     is trying to jimmy open a window using his whole body for
     leverage.  He finally pops the window open.  Gun drawn, he
     climbs over the sill.  And falls head first.


     INT. BATHROOM

     Roger splashes into the toilet bowl in the Acme washroom.  He
     bobs up.  He drains the water out of the pistol barrel and
     peeks over the bowl.  He gets a determined look in his eye.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               It's time to make my move.

     Roger starts to climb out of the toilet.  He reaches for
     something to grab onto.  Unwittingly, he gets the toilet
     chain hanging from the tank above.  As he pulls himself out,
     the toilet flushes.   Roger has only a moment to register a
     dumbfounded expression before he is sucked down the john.


     IN THE FACTORY - DOOM

     continues expansively.

                               DOOM
               Right here where we're standing, will
               be the cornerstone of my idea... the
               cloverleaf -- an elegant cement
               structure that intertwines freeways.

                               VALIANT
               What the hell's a freeway?

                               DOOM
               A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes
               of asphalt running uninterrupted from
               L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to
               Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica.
               Someday everyone will be in cars
               driving happily, non-stop from one end
               of the L.A. Basin to another.

                               VALIANT
               That's what this is all about?  Tell
               me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway?
               We got the Red Cars, the best public
               transportation in the country.

                               DOOM
               Not for long.  We're retiring the Red
               Cars.  People will drive, Mr. Valiant,
               because they'll have to.  And when they
               drive, they'll have to buy our cars,
               our tires, our gasoline.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Why'd you bother to call it a freeway?

     Doom steps up into their faces.  Behind him, several Weasles
     are fashioning a noose.

                               DOOM
               Has a nice ring.  Too bad you two won't
               be around to enjoy it.

     Suddenly Roger EXPLODES out of the drainage grate in the
     floor.  His entrance sends the Weasles flying.  Roger lands
     on his feet, James Cagney-like, levelling his gun on Judge
     Doom.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Get 'em up.  All of you!  Or I let the
               Judge have it!

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Roger, darling!

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Yes, it's me, my dearest.  I'd embrace
               you but first I have to take care of
               some unfinished business.

                               DOOM
               Put that gun down, you buck-toothed
               fool.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Go ahead.  Give me an excuse to fill
               you full of holes, pump you full of
               lead.
                      (over shoulder)
               How'm I doin', Eddie?

                               VALIANT
               Real good, Rog... but maybe you better
               let me take over.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Not before I satisfy my sense of moral
               outrage.

     Milking the moment, he shifts the gun from one hand to
     another.  He circles Doom, poking and prodding him with the
     gun.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               You think you could get away with this?
               Hah!  We Toons may be idiotic, but
               we're not stupid!


     POV OVERHEAD

     We LOOK DOWN on the proceedings from high in the rafters.
     PULL BACK TO REVEAL we're watching from the POV of Voltaire,
     who's perched on the top inventory rack.  Voltaire cleans his
     fingernails, casually.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Yes, justice, Judge Doom.  The real
               meaning of the word probably hits you
               like a ton of bricks!

     Voltaire calmly nudges an Acme Ton-Of-Bricks off the shelf.


     CLOSE - ROGER

     He never sees it coming.  SMASH!  The bricks land on his head
     and bury him.  The only thing we can see of Roger is his hand
     with the gun in it.

                               DOOM
               Well, this is turning out better than
               I thought.

     Doom picks the gun up.  The Weasles drag Roger out from under
     the bricks.  Big bright stars are circling his head.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (delirious)
               Look, stars!  Ready when you are,
               Raoul.

     Valiant shakes his head, but Jessica starts to laugh.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               I have missed you, Roger.

                               DOOM
               Tie the lovebirds together.

     The Weasles twirl Toon rope around Roger and Jessica like a
     cocoon.  They hook them on a power winch.  Then hit a button
     and raise Roger and Jessica until they're suspended fifteen
     feet above the floor... right in the path of the Dipmobile.

     Doom hands Valiant's gun to the head Weasle.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Let him watch his Toon friends get
               dipped...  then shoot him.

     Doom turns and starts to walk away.


     ANGLE ON GROUND

     He steps on a Toon banana peel and goes flat on his keester.


     THE WEASLES

     always quick with a laugh, BREAK UP at their boss'
     misfortune.  The one guarding Eddie is so overcome with
     LAUGHTER that he's slapping his thigh with his gun hand.
     Valiant sees his opportunity.  He starts to make a move
     toward the distracted Weasle and almost gets his hands on the
     gun when:

                               DOOM
               Watch out, you idiot... he's going for
               the gun!

     The Weasle turns at the last second, sticking the barrel up
     against Valiant's nose.  Doom gets to his feet.  He glowers
     at the Weasle and knocks him on the head with the gavel head
     of his cane.  Doom stalks out of the room.

     The Weasles scramble to positions on the Dipmobile.  One
     FIRES UP the ENGINE.

     The streetcleaner brushes start to turn.  The vehicle starts
     to creep forward.

     Another Weasle climbs into the turret.  He puts Roger and
     Jessica in the crosshairs of the cannon.

     Beads of sweat break out on Valiant's face.

     The Weasle, WHEEZING with evil glee, starts to press his
     finger to the trigger.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               You guys think this is real funny,
               doncha?
                      (to Valiant)
               Eddie, do somethin'!

     At the last second, Eddie shouts at the Weasle.

                               VALIANT
               Hey!

     The Weasle turns to him.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Before you pull the trigger, I want you
               to know somethin' about the guy you're
               about to dip.

     Suddenly, Eddie breaks into the "Looney Tooney Song".  The
     song Roger had sung in the bar.  The silly voice that comes
     out of his mouth surprises everybody, especially Roger.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing;
                       sings)
               'His name is Roger Rabbit
               He's got a crazy habit...'

     Valiant starts skulking across the floor.  It's a cross
     between Groucho Marx and a Chuck Berry Duck Walk.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing;
                       sings)
               'He likes to sing and dance and yuk
               So brighten up and smile you
                  schmuck...'

     Valiant starts "hoo-hooing", slapping himself in the
     forehead.  Now the Weasles start GIGGLING.  They've never
     seen a human do this before.

                               VALIANT
               'Now my name's Eddie V
               I'm looney too you'll see'

     Valiant flips into a handstand and starts walking on his
     hands.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               'I walk with my hands
               And I shake with my feet...'

     He offers his foot to a Weasle who shakes it.  The others
     HOWL.  Eddie flips upright and grabs a stick of Acme
     dynamite.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               'I think dynamite
               Is swell to eat'.

     Eddie takes a bite out of the Toon dynamite and acts like
     he's savoring it.  The spectacle of this human doing this is
     too much to bear.  Now the Weasles are rolling on the ground,
     holding their sides.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               He's lost his mind!

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Yeah, isn't it great?  Keep it up,
               Eddie... you're killing 'em, you're
               slayin' 'em, you're knockin' 'em dead.

     Roger means it.  The Weasles are laughing so hard they're
     giving themselves heart attacks.  Valiant spins around on the
     floor like a clock dial gone berserk.

                               VALIANT
               Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo...

     One by one, the Weasles keel over... dead.  Opaque WEASLE
     SPIRITS leave their bodies with wings and harps, and float
     heavenward, still laughing.


     VOLTAIRE

     alarmed at the scene below, grabs a brick and flaps toward
     the ceiling.  He throws the brick through the skylight and
     flies out.

                               VOLTAIRE
               Doom!  Doom!


     ON THE DIPMOBILE

     The Weasle on the turret collapses onto the trigger.  The
     unmanned dip cannon starts spraying, as the arm sweeps
     slowly back and forth like an, automatic lawn sprinkler.


     VALIANT

     hitches a ride on the last ascending Weasle Spirit, letting
     it hoist him to the top of the truck.  As he moves the Weasle
     body off the trigger...


     VOLTAIRE

     CRASHES back through the skylight and swoops down on Eddie.
     He sinks his talons into Eddie's back and lifts him into the
     air.

     As Valiant is being pulled skyward he reaches for something
     along the wall of inventory.  He grabs a handful of Acme
     Small Pills and jams a couple dowm the buzzard's mouth.
     Instantly, Voltaire starts to shrink.  As he gets smaller, he
     can no longer hold Eddie up.  They both descend as Voltaire
     shrinks to the size of a chick.

     The sprayer is swinging back towards Roger and Jessica.  At
     the last second, Valiant reaches up and blocks it.  It swings
     back the other way.

     As Valiant scrambles up on the vehicle to turn it off,
     Voltaire has found a box of Acme Big Pills.  He pecks into
     it... and after a beat, EXPLODES out of the box.  He's now
     three times the size he was before.  Voltaire flaps in for
     the kill.

     Valiant reaches the turret just in time to swing the cannon
     around.  The spray of dip blasts one of Voltaire's wings off.
     He spins earthward like a flaming Messerschmidt, finally
     landing in the dip vat and dissolving into a black pool.

     Doom arrives just in time to see his pet bird dissolved.
     Angrily, he steps onto a giant Acme Mousetrap.  He uses a
     piece of Acme cheese to spring it, catapulting him through
     the air.

     Just as Valiant is about to turn off the dip cannon, Doom
     lands on the truck.  He knocks Eddie off the turret with a
     flying tackle.  They both hit the floor.

     Doom gets up, leaving Eddie stunned.  He sprints to where the
     Weasle had dropped Eddie's pistol.  Finally Eddie shakes it
     off.  He sees Doom about to reach the gun.  He straps on a
     pair of Acme Rocket Skates, fires them up and shoots across
     the floor.  He knocks Doom into a stack of Acme boxes,
     toppling the whole shelf down on top of him.

     As the sprayer swings back toward Roger and Jessica, they
     have their last moment together.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Roger, I want you to know I love you.
               I loved you more than any woman has
               ever loved a rabbit.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Be comforted in the knowledge that as
               we face the Grim Dipper, our paint will
               be comingled for eternity.

     They both close their eyes, waiting for the end.  But it
     never cames.  The truck runs up on some boxes and the sprayer
     arm swings back the other way.

     Doom grabs an Acme slingshot, loads an Acme boulder and fires
     it at Valiant.  BLAM!  It whacks Valiant on the head, laying
     him out cold in front of the Cloverleaf steamroller,

     Doom climbs into the steamroller and starts it up.  He puts
     it into gear and starts it rolling toward Valiant.

     Valiant comes around to see the huge roller bearing down on
     him.  At the last second, Valiant rolls out of the way and
     grabs an Acme boxing glove.  It accordians out and smashes
     Doom in the face.  He goes flying out of the driver's seat,
     turning the wheel as he falls.  The steamroller starts to
     turn in circles.

     Valiant jumps Doom.  But Doom is stronger.  He throws Valiant
     off and starts whacking him with his fist.  He pummels
     Valiant backward toward the drum of the steamroller.  Valiant
     grabs the nearest thing for defense.  It's a can of Acme
     Stay-Put Adhesive.  He whips it up in front of his face.
     Doom puts his fist right through it, covering his hand with
     glue.  He smiles at Valiant and hauls off again.  Valiant
     ducks.  Doom's fist strikes the top of the drum of the
     steamroller.  Frantically he tries to pull it off.  But it
     "Stays-Put".  The roller starts to suck his fist down and
     under.

                               DOOM
               Nooooo!

     Jessica and Roger avert their eyes as the steamroller crushes
     Doom.

     Valiant breathes a sigh of relief.  He starts for the dip
     truck as the cannon swings back toward Roger and Jessica.
     But neither of them are watching the cannon.  Their eyes are
     fixed on the ground behind the steamroller.


     ANGLE ON GROUND

     There isn't the messy pile of blood and guts you'd expect to
     see if a human got run over.  Instead, we see that Judge
     Doom's remains have rolled out like a flat black pancake.
     After a beat, an edge curls up with a CREAK.  Now the whole
     shape peels off the floor and wobbles to it's feet. REVEALING
     DOOM IS A TOON.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Eddie, look out!


     VALIANT

     turns to see Doom stick his flattened thumb in his mouth.  He
     blows, re-inflating himself.  His glasses CRACK and fall off.
     Then his prosthetic eyeballs pop out.  His teeth shatter and
     fall out of his mouth like china.  Underneath his latex mask
     we can see his Toon mouth and evil red Toon eyes.

                               VALIANT
               Holy shit, he's a Toon!

                               DOOM
               Surprised?

                               VALIANT
               Not really.  Only a Toon could think of
               something as goofy as that freeway
               idea.

     Doom takes the black rubber gloves off, REVEALING red hands
     with long fingernails.  He makes his fist into an anvil and
     advances on Valiant.

                               DOOM
               Is that so?  Well, we'll see who's the
               goofy one.

     BLAM!  From ten feet away, he smashes Valiant with a
     bone-crushing punch.  Valiant staggers backwards.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               By the way, when I killed your brother,
               Teddy, I used to talk just like this.

     Doom spesks in a Toony high-pitched squeak.  Valiant
     recognizes him now.

                               VALIANT
               You?

                               DOOM
               That's right, me.

     BLAM!  Doom hammers Valiant again.  He's defenseless against
     Doom's super human strength.  BLAM!  Valiant goes
     sprawling to the ground.  Now Doom's hand turns into a
     buzzsaw.  He goes to administer the coup de grace.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Now Eddie's gonna be deady, just like
               Teddy.

     With his last ounce of strength, Valiant grabs the Acme
     Boxing Glove.  He pops it.  The glove extends across the
     room, punching the release lever on the dip truck.


     CLOSE - VALVE

     A flood of dip gushes out of the valve and rolls toward Doom
     like a wave.


     DOOM

     SCREAMS as the torrent hits him with a CRASH.  But there's no
     escape for him this time.  The flood of liquid envelopes him
     at the ankles.  He dissolves into it like a melting candle.


     THE DIPMOBILE

     continues forward inexorably.  The arm is swinging towards
     Roger and Jessica.  It gets closer and closer...

     Valiant tries to get to the truck, but it's too late.  The
     cannon has reached them.


     CLOSE - ROGER AND JESSICA

     They close their eyes, preparing to meet their Maker.  But
     nothing happens.

     The spray of the cannon suddenly peters out.  It dries up in
     a harmless drip as the tank has completely emptied.

     Valiant gets to the controls of the power winch.  He hoists
     Roger and Jessica up out of the way.  The Dipmobile passes
     harmlessly underneath them and SMASHES through the brick
     wall.


     TOONTOWN

     is REVEALED in all its splendor.  It's a bucolic setting.  A
     rainbow shares the blue sky with a smiling sun.  Fawns and
     butterflies, chipmunks and flowers watch curiously as the dip
     truck rolls past.  Suddenly it's lifted off the ground.  We
     see it's resting on the top of a TOON GIANT's head.  This
     Giant plucks the truck off his head, regards it, then pops it
     in his mouth.


     VALIANT

     lowers Roger and Jessica to the ground.  We HEAR POLICE
     SIRENS approach.  When Valiant unties them, Jessica turns and
     exclaims...

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               My hero!

     Then she hugs Roger passionately.  Valiant can only shrug.


     THROUGH THE WALL - TOONS

     start coming in.  They look around at the scene, bewildered,
     then gather around Doom's robe, mask and shoes lying in the
     puddle of dip.  There's a reddish slick floating on top.
     Valiant wanders over and joins them.

                               VALIANT
               Hi-ho, the Doom is dead.


     ANGLE ON DOOR

     Dolores, Lt. Santino, and several other COPS rush in, guns
     drawn.  Dolores runs to Eddie and puts her arms around him.
     Santino looks down at the remains on the floor.

                               LT. SANTINO
               What the hell is that?

                               VALIANT
               Doom.

                               LT. SANTINO
               Jesus Christ... that was the Judge?

     Valiant takes the paint chip out of his pocket.  He puts it
     up against the red slime on the robe.  It's a match.

                               VALIANT
               That was the murderer of Herman Acme,
               Maroon... and my brother.

     Dolores looks down at the front of Valiant's shirt.  A dark
     stain is appearing.

                               DOLORES
               Eddie, we better get you to hospital.
               You're bleedin'.

     Valiant looks down at the stain.

                               VALIANT
               That's not blood.  That's ink.  That
               goof Acme squirted me with some the
               other day.  Why it's comin' 'through
               now, I don't know.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               That's because it's
               Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up
               three days later.  Gives you enough
               time to get away from the victim so he
               doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great
               gag.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah...

                               DOLORES
               I'll treat you to a new shirt.  After
               all, you did save Toontown.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Problem is without Marvin's will, the
               land still goes to Cloverleaf.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               That's right.  If only we knew what
               happened to that will...

     Valiant looks up from his shirt.

                               VALIANT
               Say Roger, remember that love letter
               you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint
               Club?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Yeah?

                               VALIANT
               I think you oughta read it to her.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Good idea.

     He reaches in his pocket, pulls out the paper and clears his
     throat.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing;
                       reads)
               Dear Jessy... How do I love thee?  Let
               me count the... I, Marvin Acme, of
               sound mind and body... Hey?


     CLOSE - PAPER

     The Disappearing-Reappearing Ink is coming up over Roger's
     scribbling.

                               VALIANT
               Keep reading...

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (reads)
               Hey, it's the will.  I, Marvin Acme, of
               sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo,
               do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the
               property known as Toontown to those
               loveable characters...

     PAN the Toon crowd, who are listening to the reading of the
     will.  It is a gallery of recognizable faces.  Everyone from
     Mickey to Bugs, Yakky Doodle to Yosemite Sam, Dumbo to Dopey,
     Bambi to Droopy, Tweety Bird to Tinkerbell.  They're all
     there.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               ... who have given me and the rest of
               humanity so much mirth and merriment...
               the Toons.

     The Toon crowd erupts with a CHEER!  Hats go in the air and
     they descend on Roger, slapping his back.  Roger breaks away
     from the crowd and joins Eddie.


     TWO SHOT - EDDIE AND ROGER

     They stand side by side, looking out over Toontown.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well, Eddie, you still think I'm a
               patsy, a simp, a chump?

     Eddie wipes the spit off his face.

                               VALIANT
               No, kid, you're a real hero.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I guess I am at that.  Cigar?

     Roger holds out a large stogie.

                               VALIANT
               Why not?

     Roger lights Eddie's and one for himself.

                               VALIANT
                       (continuing)
               By the way, Roger, you were right about
               your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm
               glad you got her back.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               And I'm glad you got your sense of
               humor back.  Think you'll keep it?

                               VALIANT
               Only time will tell.

     Valiant puffs on the cigar.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               From this box here...

     Valiant glances down.  The box says, "Acme Exploding Cigars".
     He looks to Roger, but it's too late.  KABOOM!  KABOOM!
     Their cigars blow up in classic Toon tradition, blackening
     both their faces.  Roger starts laughing.  Eddie stares at
     Roger for a moment, then he starts laughing too.  They throw
     their heads back in a HOWL.  The other Toons join in.  Pretty
     soon the whole factory is shaking with LAUGHTER.


     A TOON COP

     dressed in blue uniform and hat with his back to us tries to
     restore order in the Acme factory.  As soon as he talks, we
     recognize the stutter.  It's PORKY PIG.

                               PORKY PIG
               O-k-k-k, mmmove along.  There's
               nnnothin' else to see.  T-t-that's it.
               T-t-that's all, folks.
                      (turns to
                       CAMERA)
               Hmm, I l-l-like the sound of that.

     Then, savoring the phrase, Porky stutters out the famous
     sign-off.

                               PORKY PIG
                      (continuing)
                Eee-ba-da, eee-ba-da... t-t-that's all,
                folks!

     CARTOON MUSIC UP.

                                               IRIS OUT.

And now the story of Sailor and Lula.....




1. EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

A MAN rides a screaming massive Japanese motorcycle - wound out to 
maximum R.P.M. up the street.

								CUT TO:


2. SIGN BY ROADSIDE

The sign reads KIDS PLAYING - SPEED BUMPS.

								CUT TO:


3. EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

With a whine from hell, the front tire of the motorcycle hits a speed 
bump.

The motorcycle becomes airborne and on the way up slices itself in half 
as it scrapes along the full length of a Datsun Kingcab.

In the air, the rider and motorcycle twist violently as they fly by.

The motorcycle bounces off a black 66 Chevrolet and makes a sound like 
the end of the world.

The rider hits the same Chevy a moment later.  Like a broken ragdoll 
shot from a canon, the man punches through the back window blowing glass 
for a block.  He stops somewhere under the front seat and a bubble of 
blood forms out his nose.

The motorcycle continues on sliding and spinning with an ear-piercing 
howl for one entire city block.

								CUT TO:


4. EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - VACANT LOT - DAY

Two rabid dogs fight ferociously in a vacant lot - ripping each others 
flesh.  An OLD COUPLE, both with walkers, inch painfully along nearby.

				OLD WOMAN
		Oh my God! ... Why they doin that?

				OLD MAN
		Who the hell knows.  What you have
		in your mouth?

The old woman begins to turn away, covering her mouth with her hand.

				OLD MAN 
		Spit it out!!! ... Pull your teeth
		out ... doctor said.  What you 
		tryin to do?  SPIT IT OUT!!!

The Old Man grabs the Old Woman by the neck and squeezes.  Out comes a 
tangled and sticky ball of hard fruit candies.

								CUT TO:


5. WASP NEST

A thousand wasps hover threateningly in the air around the nest.  A 
SMALL GROUP OF HARDENED CRIMINAL NINE-YEAR OLDS sporting hideous grins, 
bat the nest violently to and fro with sticks.  One kid busies himself 
shooting a large can of Black Flag garden spray into a crack in the 
nest.  Another stomps half-dead wasps up and down the sidewalk.  All the 
kids are making animal noises of one sort or the other.

								CUT TO:


6. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

The telephone rings.  MARIETTA PACE FORTUNE, a rich Southern woman 
around fifty, carries her Martini and Rossi sweet vermouth drink across 
the livingroom and answers the phone.

				MARIETTA
		Hello...  Who is this?...

								CUT TO:


7. INT. PEE DEE COUNTY WORK FARM - DAY

A GUARD stands by as SAILOR RIPLEY, twenty-three years old - lost 
somewhere between the cool long-gone generation and a used-car salesman 
- speaks on a prisoner phone in a green cement cubicle with one bench.

				SAILOR
			(into phone)
		...Sailor Ripley...  Can I talk 
		to Lula?

								CUT TO:


6A. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

				MARIETTA
		Theres no way in hell you can speak
		to her and...

								CUT TO:


7A. INT. PEE DEE COUNTY WORK FARM - DAY

				SAILOR
			(feeling a smile coming on)
		What?...

								CUT TO:


6B. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

				MARIETTA
		...Yes you heard me...  Dont ever 
		call back here again.

Marietta hangs up the phone as LULA PACE FORTUNE, Mariettas twenty-year 
old daughter, comes quickly down the stairs.

				LULA
		Mama???

				MARIETTA
		You know who it was and you know 
		you arent, and I mean ARE NOT 
		gonna see him EVER...  End of story.

				LULA
			(quietly)
		Like hell.

Marietta, her hand still on the telephone, grips the receiver so hard 
her knuckles turn white.

								CUT TO:


8. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - LULAS ROOM UPSTAIRS - DAY

Lula enters her room and cranks up her stereo.  Speed metal music jumps 
up to around one hundred twenty decibels.

								CUT TO:


9. INT. PEE DEE COUNTY WORK FARM - DAY

The guard escorts Sailor away from the telephone and back to his cell.  
The iron bars of the door slide across Sailors face and close with a 
bang.

								CUT TO:


10. EXT. THE MUSIC BAR - NIGHT

A beat-up, red 64 Ford Falcon station wagon filled with insane 
TEENAGERS on speed and PCP race out of control down the street past the 
club - leaning out the car in every direction.  They scream out to the 
desolate-looking passerby.

				TEENAGERS
		EAT SHIT MOTHERFUCKERS!!!!!!

The camera cranes up to the neon club sign and gets lost among the hot 
pink neon, the frantic moths and the intense electric buzz.

								CUT TO:


11. INT. THE MUSIC BAR - NIGHT

Lula and her friend, BEANY THORN, sit at a table drinking rum Coca-Colas 
while watching and listening to a white blues band called THE BLEACH 
BOYS.  The group segues smoothly from Elmore Jamess Dust my Broom 
into Robert Johnsons Me and the Devil and Beany lets out a snort.

				BEANY
		I can dig this music...  But not 
		that singer.

				LULA
		Why?...  Hes right in the groove.

				BEANY
		Hes so ugly.  Guys with beards and
		beer guts aint quite my type.

				LULA
		          (giggles)
		Seeins how youre about as thick as
		a used string of unwaxed dental floss,
		dont know how you can criticize.

				BEANY
		Yeah, well, if he says that all that
		flab turns into dick at midnight, 
		hes a liar.

Lula and Beany laugh and swallow some of their drinks.

				BEANY
		So, Sailors gettin out soon, and
		youre gonna see him?

Lula nods and crushes an ice cube with her back teeth and chews it.

				LULA
		Meetin him at the gate.  That phone
		call this afternoon was the signal.
		My deranged mamas hid the keys to
		my car.  But of course, I know 
		exactly where they are.

				BEANY
		I didnt hate me so much, Id feel
		better wishin you luck.

				LULA
		Cant all husbands be perfect, and
		your Elmo probly wouldnta ever 
		got that second one pregnant, you
		hadnt kicked his ass out.

				BEANY
		So youre gonna be needin the 
		blue-bird pretty soon?

				LULA
		Real soon ... Ill be makin the swap 
		tomorrow, and thanks again, Beany.

The Bleach Boys kick into some kind of Professor Longhair swamp mambo.

12. EXT. BAY ST. CLEMENT - DAY

Plumes of smoke from fires rise in the distance.

DISSOLVE TO:


13. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

An empty livingroom.  The smoke from the city fire appears during the 
course of the DISSOLVE to be in the livingroom - then it disappears.

An empty hallway.

An empty stairway.


13A. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - MARIETTAS BEDROOM - DAY

Feet (Lulas) was across carpet.

A closet door opens.

A hand (Lulas) reaches into the pocket of a coat in her mothers 
closet.  The hand comes out clutching car keys.

Lula races down the stairs and through a door into the garage.

								CUT TO:

The electronic garage door opens and Lula drives her 80 Black Camaro 
out and away.  The garage door closes automatically.

								CUT TO:


15. EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

Lula drives fast up a neighborhood street.  She turns a corner and 
disappears.

								CUT TO:


16. INT. BEANY THORNS GARAGE - DAY

Lula throws her car keys under the front seat and goes around to Beanys 
67 dark blue Thunderbird convertible - fishes around under the T-Birds 
front seat for the keys - finds them - jumps in and takes off.

DISSOLVE TO:


17. EXT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

Marietta leaves her Cadillac Seville in her driveway and enters the 
house.  We can hear her calling out for Lula in the distance.  The 
calling changes - it becomes angry.  The garage door opens and Marietta 
comes storming out.  She leaps in her Caddy and peels out.

								CUT TO:


18. INT. SOUTHERN TIME BAR - DAY

Marietta enters the bar on the run.  She calls out to the BARTENDER...

				MARIETTA
		Wheres Johnnie?  Hes not in his office.

				BARTENDER
		Havent seen im yet today, Marietta.

				MARIETTA
			(slightly hysterical)
		Well I gotta find him - right this
		minute!

								CUT TO:


19. EXT. PEE DEE COUNTY WORK FARM - DAY

Sailor is waiting out front as Lula pulls up in her T-Bird - throwing 
out a cloud of dust.  Theyre both smiling.

				LULA
		Hey baby...

				SAILOR
		Peanut...

They kiss tenderly and then Sailor walks around the car to get in while 
Lula opens up a suitcase and gets out his snakeskin jacket.

				SAILOR
		Hey, my snakeskin jacket...  Thanks,    
		baby...  Did I ever tell you that
		this here jacket for me is a symbol
		of my individuality and my belief
		in personal freedom?

				LULA
		Bout fifty thousand times.  I got 
		us a room at the Cape Fear, and 
		guess what?...  I hear Powermads 
		at The Hurricane.

				SAILOR
			(smiling)
		Stab it and steer.

Lula tromps it and throws out an even larger cloud of dust.

								CUT TO:


20. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY

Sailor and Lula lay on the bed in the Cape Fear Hotel listening to the 
fan creak.

				LULA
		Did you ever think somethin like
		about the wicked witch of the east
		comin flyin in?...  Did you ever
		think somethin and then later think
		youve said it out loud to someone?

				SAILOR
		I really did miss your mind while I
		was out at Pee Dee, honey.  The
		rest of you, too, of course.  But 
		the way your head works is Gods own
		private mystery.  What was it you
		was thinkin?

				LULA
		Well, I was thinkin about smokin 
		actually...  My mama smokes Marlboros
		now, used to be she smoked Kools?
		I stole em from her beginnin in
		about sixth grade.  When I got old
		enough to buy my own, I bought those.
		Now Ive just about settled on Mores,
		as you probably noticed?  Theyre longer.


				SAILOR
		I guess I started smokin when I was
		about six...  My mama was already
		dead from lung cancer...

				LULA
		What brandd she smoke?

				SAILOR
		Camels, same as me...  Guess both
		my mama and my daddy died of smoke
		or alcohol related illness.

				LULA
		Gee, Sailor.  Im sorry, honey.  I 
		never would have guessed it.

				SAILOR
		Its okay.  I hardly used to see 
		them anyway.  I didnt have much 
		parental guiding.  The public defender
		kept sayin that at my parole hearin.
		He was a good ol boy, stood by me...
		Even brought me some cartons of 
		cigarettes from time to time.

				LULA
		Id stand by you, Sailor ... through
		anything.

				SAILOR
		Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after
		I planted Bob Ray Lemon.  A man cant
		ask for more than that.

Lula pulls Sailor over to her and kisses him soft on the mouth.

				LULA
		You move me, Sailor, you really do.
		You mark me the deepest.

Sailor pulls down the sheet, exposing Lulas breasts.

				SAILOR
		Youre perfect for me, too.

				LULA
		You remind me of my daddy, you know?
		Mama told me he liked skinny women
		whose breasts were just a bit too
		big for their bodies.  He had a long
		nose, too, like theirs.  Did I ever
		tell you how he died?

				SAILOR
		In a fire, as I recall.

				LULA
		Started he couldnt remember things?
		Got real violent?  Mama kept tellin
		me it was on account of lead poisoning
		from cleanin the old paint off our
		house without usin a mask...  But
		I dont know.  Seems like his brain
		just fell apart in pieces.

								CUT TO:


21. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

CLYDE FORTUNE tears a door off the kitchen cabinets and strews the 
cabinet contents all across the counter and floor.  He puts his fist 
through the kitchen window.  He leaps on the counter and bats the 
kitchen ceiling light - smashing it.  He kicks over the refrigerator.

				CLYDE
		FUCKIN BITCH!!!!

								CUT TO:


22. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY

Lulas eyes look off, remembering.

				LULA
		Finally in the middle of the one 
		night, with me and mama asleep 
		upstairs ... he poured kerosene over
		himself and lit a match.

								CUT TO:


23. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - LIVINGROOM - NIGHT

Clyde Fortune, completely engulfed in fire, races across and back the 
livingroom until he collapses in a fifties modern armchair.  The drapes 
behind him burst in flames.

				LULA
			(voice-over)
		Near burned down the house.  We 
		got out just in time.

The whole livingroom goes up in flames.

								CUT TO:


24. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY

CU the red hot ash of Lulas cigarette as she inhales deeply.  As she 
exhales a cloud of smoke she turns to Sailor.

				LULA
		It was a year before I met you.

Sailor takes the cigarette out of Lulas hand and puts it into the 
ashtray by her bed.  He pulls her to him and kisses her throat.

				SAILOR
		You have such a pretty, long neck, 
		like a swan.

				LULA
		Grandmama Pace had a long, smooth
		white neck.  It was like on a 
		statue it was so white?

Sailor drifts his thumb over Lulas left nipple then cups her breast in 
his hand.  They kiss.

								CUT TO:


25. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

Marietta pours JOHNNIE FARRAGUT another shot of scotch.

				MARIETTA
		I knew this would happen.  Soon as
		that piece of filth got out of 
		Pee Dee, I knew thered be trouble.
		Hes just got some kind of influence
		over her I cant decipher.  Theres 
		somethin wild in Lula I dont know
		where it comes from.  You gotta find
		em, Johnnie.

				JOHNNIE
		He served his time for what he did.
		Another thing...  If Lula went with
		him of her own volition - willingly,
		that is - there aint much can be
		done about it.

				MARIETTA
		Dont talk down to me, Johnnie 
		Farragut.  I know what volition means,
		and thats why I want Sailor Ripley
		off the planet!  Hes pure slime and 
		its leakin all over my baby.  
		Maybe you could push him into makin
		some kinda move and then kill him
		dead.  Youd only be defendin 
		yourself, and with his record, 
		nobodyd fuss.

Johnnie pours himself another tumblerful of Walker Black Label.

				JOHNNIE
		Ill locate Lula, Marietta, and if
		shes with the Ripley boy, Ill
		give him a talkin to and try to
		convince her to come back with me.
		Thats about all I can do.

He takes a long swallow from the tumbler.  Marietta begins to cry.  She 
blubbers for a few seconds, and then stops as abruptly as shed started.  
Her grey eyes glaze over.

				MARIETTA
		Ill hire a hit man if you dont want
		to help me stop this thing.  Ill
		call Marcello Santos.

				JOHNNIE
		Now, Marietta, I am goin to help you.
		And dont be gettin carried away.
		You dont want to be bringin Santos
		and his people into it.

				MARIETTA
		Youre just jealous of Santos cause
		hes sweet on me.

				JOHNNIE
		Darlin, you aint seein Santos 
		again, are ya?

				MARIETTA
		Oh, Johnnie Farragut...  Dont you 
		trust your very own Marietta?

				JOHNNIE
		Sorry, sweetheart.  Bein in love 
		with you like I am brings out that 
		ugly jealous side.

				MARIETTA
		Well stop worryin about me and 
		start worryin about how youre 
		gonna get that Lula back here and 
		away from that murderer.

				JOHNNIE
		Sailor aint a murderer.  You got to
		get off that kick.  And fars I can 
		tell, Sailor was entire clean prior
		to that involvin Lula.  Even there
		he was protectin her.  You oughta
		be thankin him for that.  That Bob
		Ray Lemon they say was comin after
		the both of em.  Why am I tellin
		you this, you was around that night.
		You ought to know just exactly what
		happened.  Sailor just got a little
		too forceful is all...  You remember
		that night...

CU of Marietta eyes as she thinks back.

								CUT TO:


26. INT. BAY ST. CLEMENT HOTEL - BALLROOM - NIGHT

We see Marietta standing in a carpeted hallway above the ballroom.  
Dance band music can be heard in the distance.  Sailor appears coming up 
the hallway - slightly drunk - he carefully sets his drink on the carpet 
outside the MENS ROOM.

Mariettas POV of Sailor entering the MENS ROOM.

CU of Mariettas glazed eyes and smiling face.

Mariettas POV of walking toward MENS ROOM.

								CUT TO:


27. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

				MARIETTA
		Maybe I was there, but I didnt see 
		anythin.  All I knows that trash
		killed a man with his bare hands.
		Hands which are now probly all
		over my baby!

				JOHNNIE
		Marietta, settle down now darlin...
		I want whats best for her, too -
		Like I said, Ill do what I can to
		bring her home.

								CUT TO:


28. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY

Lula is standing in the bathroom of their room at the Hotel fooling with 
her hair in front of the mirror.  Sailor can see her through the doorway 
from where he lays on the bed.

				LULA
		Sailor, you are somethin else, 
		honey...  When I was fifteen, Mama
		told me that pretty soon Id be
		startin to think about sex, and
		I should talk to her before I did
		anything about it.

				SAILOR
		But honey, I thought you told me
		your Uncle Pooch raped you when
		you was thirteen.

				LULA
		Thats true.  Uncle Pooch wasnt
		really an uncle.  He was a business
		partner of my daddys?  And my mama
		never knew nothin about me and 
		him - thats for damn sure.  His real
		name was somethin kind of European,
		like Pucinski.  But everyone just
		called him Pooch.  He came around the
		house sometimes when Daddy was away.
		I always figured he was sweet on 
		mama, so when he cornered me one 
		afternoon, I was surprised moren
		a little.

				SAILOR
		Howd it happen, peanut?  He just
		pull out the old toad and let it
		croak?

Lula brushes away her bangs and frowns.  She takes a cigarette from the 
pack on the sink and lights it, then lets it dangle from her lips while 
she teases her hair.

				LULA
		Youre terrible crude sometimes, 
		Sailor, you know?

				SAILOR
		I cant hardly understand you when
		you talk with one of them Mores in
		your mouth.

Lula takes a long, slow drag on her More and sets it down on the edge of 
the sink.

				LULA
		I said you can be too crude sometimes?
		I dont think I care for it.

				SAILOR
		Sorry, sugar.  Go on and tell me how
		old Pooch done the deed.

				LULA
		Well, mama was at the Busy Bee havin
		her hair dyed?  And I was alone in 
		the house.

								CUT TO:


29. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

We see what she talks about.

				LULA
			(voice-over)
		Uncle Pooch came in the side door
		through the porch, you know?  Where
		I was makin a jelly and banana
		sandwich?  I remember I had my hair
		in curlers cause I was goin that
		night with Vicki and Cherry Ann, the
		DeSoto sisters.  Uncle Pooch must have
		known nobody but me was home, cause 
		he came right in and put both his
		hands on my butt and sorta shoved me
		up against the counter.

								CUT TO:


30. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY

				SAILOR
		Didnt he say somethin?

Lula shakes her head.  She picks up her cigarette, takes a puff and 
throws it into the toilet.

ECU of cigarette in toilet.

				LULA
		Not really.  Least not so I recall now.

Lula flushes the toilet and watches the More come apart as it swirls 
down the hole.

ECU of cigarette coming apart as it swirls.

				SAILOR
		So howd he finally nail you?  Right 
		there in the kitchen?  

				LULA
		No, he picked me up.

								CUT TO:


31. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - KITCHEN/MAIDS ROOM - DAY

We see what she talks about.

				LULA
			(voice-over)
		He was short but powerful.  With 
		hairy arms?  Anyway, he carried me 
		into the maids dayroom which nobody
		used.  We did it there on an old bed.

								CUT TO:


32. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY

				SAILOR
		We did it?  Whattaya mean?  Didnt
		he force you?

				LULA
		Well, sure.  But he was super-gentle,
		you know?  I mean, he raped me and
		all, but I guess theres all 
		different kinds of rapes.  I didnt
		exactly want him to do it but I 
		suppose once it started, it didnt
		seem all that terrible.  It was over 
		pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch
		just stood there and pulled up his
		trousers and left me there.  I 
		stayed in bed till I heard him drive
		off.  Then I just went back into
		the kitchen and finished makin my
		sandwich.

				SAILOR
		And you never told nobody about it?

				LULA
		Just you.  Uncle Pooch never acted
		strange or different after.  And he
		never did anything else to me.  I
		always got a nice present from him
		at Christmas, like a coat or jewelry?
			(pause)

								CUT TO:


33. TWO LANE HIGHWAY - DAY

One hundred twenty decibels - head on collision of a 54 Ford Pick-Up 
and a 64 Chevy Station Wagon.  No survivors.  Balls of flame and 
grinding metal.

								CUT TO:


34. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY

				LULA
		Uncle Pooch died in a car crash three
		years later while he was holidayin
		in Myrtle Beach.  They still got way
		too much traffic there for my taste...
		And another thing, baby...  That
		government of ours should be keepin
		us separated from outer space...

				SAILOR
		Here she goes again...

				LULA
		Sailor, that ozone layer is
		disappearin.  Seems to me the 
		government could do somethin about

Lula strikes a match and lights another cigarette.

				SAILOR
			(laughs)
		That aint never will happen, honey.
		Least not in our lifetime.

Somewhere in the hotel a woman laughs.  It is a kind of wild, crazy 
laugh, and for the few seconds it lasts, Lulas face goes pale.

				SAILOR
		You okay, honey?

				LULA
		That womans laugh creeps me out.
		I heard somethin like that...
		somewhere before...  Soundd like 
		the wicked witch...

				SAILOR
		Just sounded like an old gal havin
		a good time to me...  You ready to
		dance?

				LULA
		Im always ready to dance.  But I
		need me a kiss first, honey.  Just one?

Lula and Sailor kiss.  In the middle of the kiss, the womans 
creepy/crazy laugh is heard again in the distance and Lulas eyes snap 
open with a kind of fear.

35. EXT. FORTUNE HOUSE - BACKYARD - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Marietta is escorting MARCELLO SANTOS and two stiff drinks to a table in 
her backyard.

				SANTOS
		I knew youd want it again...

				MARIETTA
		Thats not why I called.

				SANTOS
		Oh yeah - sure ... okay.

				MARIETTA
		Santos...  It isnt.

				SANTOS
		Have it your way...  But you want it.

				MARIETTA
		Lulas gone off with Sailor.

				SANTOS
		What do you want me to do about it?

				MARIETTA
		I want you to take care of Sailor, so
		he wont ever be able to bother my
		baby again.


				SANTOS
		Take care of him?

				MARIETTA
		Yes.

				SANTOS
		What does take care of him mean?...
		Do you want me to give him food or
		some clothing?

				MARIETTA
		Whats with you?...  You know what
		take care of him means.  I dont 
		call Santos except for one big reason.

				SANTOS
		Big is the key word, and Im telling
		you I want it bad.

				MARIETTA
		I want you to get rid of Sailor.

				SANTOS
		Get rid of him?

				MARIETTA
		Yes...  Get rid of him.

				SANTOS
		How would I do that?  Send him on a
		trip - like maybe to Hawaii?

				MARIETTA
		Santos, why in hell do you insist on
		playin this stupid game?

				SANTOS
		Just tell me what you want.

				MARIETTA
		I dont need to explain anymoren I
		have...  You know damn well.

				SANTOS
		You need to explain it.

				MARIETTA
		All right...  I want you ... to ...
		kill ... Sailor...  As simple as that.

				SANTOS
		Simple?  Kill him?...  How?

				MARIETTA
		Thats your business...  I dont care
		how.

				SANTOS
		Like an accident where maybe Lula
		might also get hurt?

				MARIETTA
		NO...  For Gods sakes, Santos!

				SANTOS
		Well, like kill him with the atomic
		bomb?

				MARIETTA
		Santos...

				SANTOS
		Explain it...  I told you.

				MARIETTA
		Shoot him.

				SANTOS
		Shoot him?  Like with a gun?

				MARIETTA
		Yes.

				SANTOS
		Where?...  In the leg?

				MARIETTA
		No.

				SANTOS
		Where?

				MARIETTA
		In the head.

				SANTOS
		Shoot Sailor in the head with a 
		gun...  Now Im beginning to get 
		it...  You want me to shoot Sailor
		in the head with a gun.

				MARIETTA
		Yes.

				SANTOS
		But where in the head?...  Not the
		chin, I hope.

				MARIETTA
		No...  In the brains...  What little
		Im sure he has.

				SANTOS
		You want me to shoot Sailor in the
		brains with a gun.  

				MARIETTA
		Yes.

				SANTOS
		Through the forehead?

				MARIETTA
		Yes.

				SANTOS
		Wrong!  Its much better to blow a
		hole in the back of the head ... 
		right toward the bridge of the nose
		...  Lots and lots of irreparable
		damage.

				MARIETTA
		See!  I knew you had it all under 
		control.

				SANTOS
		Why didnt you send Johnnie Farragut?

				MARIETTA
		Maybe I did...  Try New Orleans first...
		Lula cant ever stop talkin bout that
		town.

				SANTOS
		On one condition...

He pauses and smiles strangely.

				SANTOS
		You give me your permission to kill
		Johnnie Farragut.

				MARIETTA
			(whisper)
		Santos...  No...  Please, Santos...

				SANTOS
		Youre not tellin me that youre 
		sweet on him?

				MARIETTA
		No...  But...

				SANTOS
		One day hes gonna find out what 
		were up to with Mr. Reindeer, and
		he could cause us a lot of trouble.

They stare at each other for a moment.

				SANTOS
		Im gonna take your silence as a 
		yes...

				MARIETTA
		Santos...  I cant...


				SANTOS
		Shhhh...  Its all right...  Also, I
		either take you or that pretty 
		daughter of yours to bed.

				MARIETTA
		You fucker, dont you ever touch 
		Lula -  You fucker, Ill kill you.

				SANTOS
			(laughing)
		Put your shoulders back.

				MARIETTA
		What?

				SANTOS
		Put your shoulders back, I said.

Marietta puts her shoulders back and Santos comes and stands in front of 
her.

				SANTOS
		You got nice tits.

				MARIETTA
		Someones gonna see us.

				SANTOS
			(smiling as he starts
			to feel her breasts)
		Thats just another part of the price
		to pay.

				MARIETTA
		Santos...  You kill that Sailor, 
		otherwise hes gonna turn my baby
		against me.

Santos lifts one hand up to Mariettas chin and raises her face up 
towards his.

				SANTOS
		Look at me...  Theres no turning back   
		on this...  Im gonna kill Sailor...
		Thats for sure.

36. INT. THE HURRICANE - A SPEED METAL CLUB - NIGHT

We see the sign which has all the letters tipped way over to the right - 
as if in a hurricane.  Two leaning palm trees border the sign.

One hundred decibels of speed metal.  We see the name Powermad on the 
bass drum.

The BAND segues into Slaughter House and its a hot one.  Sailor grabs 
Lula and they start dancing like two jacked-up spastics in an electrical 
storm.  a few PUNKS actually stop dancing to watch Sailor and Lula.  
They thought theyd seen everything.

CU of Lula and Sailor - theyre in love and dancing hot.  An IDIOT PUNK 
moves close to Lula and rubs up against her as he dances by.  Sailor 
turns to the lead guitar player and signals him to stop the music 
immediately.  Suddenly everything is deathly quiet.  Sailor gives the 
man a fully extended Reno point...

				SAILOR
		Are you going to provide me with an 
		opportunity to prove my love to my
		girl?  Or are you gonna save 
		youself some trouble and step up 
		like a gentleman and apologize to her?

				IDIOT PUNK
		Dont fuck with me, man.  You look 
		like a clown in that stupid jacket.

				SAILOR
		This is a snakeskin jacket, and for
		me its a symbol of my individuality
		and my belief in personal freedom.

				IDIOT PUNK
		...Asshole.

				SAILOR
		(as he moves toward the Idiot Punk)
		Come here.

				LULA
		Sailor, honey...

The Idiot Punk tries to hit Sailor, but Sailor slaps him so hard his 
knees almost bend backwards.  The Idiot Punk goes down - fighting back 
tears and holding his cheek.

				SAILOR
		     (helping him up)
		Im sorry to do this to ya here 
		in front of a crowd, but I want ya
		to stand up and make a nice apology
		to my girl.

				IDIOT PUNK
			(to Lula)
		Im sorry.

				LULA
		Hell, you just rubbed up against 
		the wrong girl is all.

				SAILOR
		Thats good...  Now go get yourself
		a beer.
			(turning to the band)
		You fellas have alotta the same power
		Elvis had...  Yall know this one?...

Sailor starts to sing an Elvis Presley song, Love Me.  As the band 
joins in with a perfect back-up - Sailor sings to Lula.  The Speed Metal 
crowd is mesmerized.

				LULA

		...  You told me that was your

Sailor turns around from his sprawled on the bed position watching The 
Dating Game show.

				SAILOR
		Cause Im only gonna sing that song

Lula makes a face.  She lies down on the bed next to Sailor.

				LULA

		Aint one of those people have a real

		You want to tell me what, if any,

Sailor grunts.

				LULA
		Whats that honey?

				SAILOR
		We didnt have no TV up at Pee Dee,

Lula slides her head up and kisses Sailor on the cheek.

				LULA
		Im sorry, sweetie.  I forget some
		moments where all you been the last
		two years.

				SAILOR
		Twenty-three months, eighteen days is

		Hell, why should the Datin Game be

Sailor and Lula are in bed.  Lula lays in Sailors arms.

				LULA
		Sailor?

				SAILOR
		Yeah?

				LULA
		Wouldnt it be fabulous if we somehow

		been doin a pretty fair job this far?

				LULA
		Oh, you know exactly what I mean, 
		honey?  Itd make the future so simple
		and nice.

				SAILOR
		At Pee Dee, all you think about is 
		the future, you know?  Gettin out?
		And what youll do and what youll
		think about when youre on the 
		outside again.

				LULA
		I just think about things as they

				SAILOR
		It aint altogether terrible just to

		Lula, I done a few things in my life
		I aint too proud of, but Ill tell

Sailor looks her in the eyes.

				SAILOR
		Whats that, peanut?

		Dell disappeared.  Dell was learnin

				SAILOR
		What do you mean by necessary?  Shes

				LULA
		I suppose so.  She knew I was bound 
		to see you soon as you was sprung,
		but I dont figure she counted on
		us takin off together like this...
		I guess this means youre breakin
		parole, then?

				SAILOR
		You guess?  My parole was broke two
		hundred miles back when we burnt
		Portagee County.

				LULA
		Whatll it be like in California,

		We got through two states already.

Lula lights up a cigarette.

		It aint.  Its part of the lessons

				SAILOR
		They sure do stink.

				LULA
		Yeah, I guess, but - and heres the

74. INT. MINI-MART - DAY

A tall OLD BLACK MAN about seventy years old, wearing a torn green 
Tulane tee-shirt and a dirty orange Saints baseball cap, is filing items 
on the counter by the cash register.  In the pile are four ready-made, 
plastic-wrapped sandwiches, two tuna salad and two cotto salami; six 
Twinkies; a package of Chips Ahoy chocolate chip cookies; four Slice 
colas; two Barqs root beers; and a large package of fried pork rinds, 
extra salted.

				BLACK MAN

		Sorry, gentlemen.  Im most finished

				ERV
		This be it?

				BLACK MAN
		Yall take American Express?

				ERV
		Yessir.

				BLACK MAN
		Then lemme throw in a couple more

Sailor and the man in line behind him watch as the black man gathers up 
several more packages of Twinkies along with a few cupcakes and half a 
dozen cans of Pretty Kitty cat food, three liver and three chicken 
dinner portions, and tosses them on his pile.

				BLACK MAN
		   (to Sailor, smiling - showing 
		    no visible upper teeth)
		Pussycats gotta eat, too.

He hands an American Express card to the clerk, ERV, who runs it through 
the verifier.  The card checks out okay and the old guy prepares a 
charge slip, has the man sign it, and bags the purchases.

				BLACK MAN
			(to Erv)
		Id just soon have a paper bag 
		rather than a plastic one, if its
		same to you.

				ERV
		  (shoving the plastic bag he
		   filled towards the black man)
		We dont have no paper bags.

A telephone begins to ring and everyone looks around.  The Black Man 
reaches in his jacket pocket and pulls out a portable phone and punches 
send.

				BLACK MAN
			(into phone)
		Hello...  Yeah, mama, Im on my 
		way...
			(to Sailor and other guy
		   as he picks up his bag
			and heads out)
		Thanks for waitin, gentlemen.

Everyone is silent as they watch the old Black Man hobble out.

				SAILOR
			(to Erv)
		All I wants ten bucks regular.
		Oh yeah, and a Mounds bar.

Erv takes one off the candy and gum rack next to the register and lays 
it on the counter.  Sailor gives him a twenty dollar bill.

				SAILOR
		I aint got my American Express card
		with me, so I gotta use cash.  Hope
		thats okay.

Sailor smiles, but the clerk keeps a poker face and just gives him his 
change.  The guy in line behind Sailor shakes his head and grins.

Reggie and Drop Shadow begin eating ferociously, finishing half of their 
meal before saying anything more.

				REGGIE

				DROP SHADOW
		No big buildings like in New Orleans.

		Oh, many things...

				REGGIE
		But I am also with the government.

Johnnie takes a bite of his oyster sandwich.

				JOHNNIE
		In what capacity?

				REGGIE
		In many capacities.

Reggie reaches into his back pocket and takes out his wallet.  He hands

				REGGIE
		He is my sponsor.  The General is

				DROP SHADOW
		Mr. San Pedro Sula is one of his

Johnnie hands the card back to Reggie and Reggie gives him a small piece 
of paper, folded once.  Johnnie unfolds it.  The printing is in Spanish.

				REGGIE
		That is my permiso.

				DROP SHADOW
		Mr. San Pedro Sulas permit to kill.

				REGGIE
		Only if necessary, of course, and
		only in my own country.

				JOHNNIE
		Of course.

Johnnie refolds the piece of paper and hands it over to Reggie.

				DROP SHADOW
		Mr. San Pedro Sulas authorized to

				REGGIE
		United States Marine issue, before

		the less dependable nine millimeters.
		I have it here, in my briefcase.

Reggie holds up his stainless steel briefcase and then replaces it on 
the floor beneath his chair.

				JOHNNIE
		Why are you in New Orleans?  If you 
		dont mind my askin.

				REGGIE
		Certainly not.  We are here only

		the CIA.

				DROP SHADOW
		He wants to take Mr. San Pedro Sula

				REGGIE
		We are in the same businesses and

Johnnie swallows the last of his beer and stands up to leave.

				JOHNNIE
			(extending his hand)
		Its been a real pleasure.  I wish

Reggie and Drop Shadow stand up.  They shake Johnnies hand.

				REGGIE
		The same to you.  If you are in 
		Honduras, come to the Bay Islands and
		visit us.  The Hondurans are great
		friends of the American people.  But
		I have a joke for you before I go.
		If a liberal, a socialist, and a

				LULA
		Why were you killin pigeons, Mr.
		Kovich?  Were you in the extermination

		No, maam.  I was a housepainter,

		Woman drivin down the street spotted

		Guilty on a reduced charge.  Hundred

		Oh, baby, what an idea.  Id always

				SAILOR
		I know, peanut.  But it wasnt all

		Actually, Im lookin for Mariettas

				CHET
		Hell, that rings a bell.  Someone

				JOHNNIE
		No sir...

				CHET
		Its none of my business, but when

				JOHNNIE
		Not for lack of love, I can tell

Lula waits just by the lobby door of the hotel.  In the back of the 
lobby in the shadows is an ancient, old BLACK MAN who stares at her.  
Sailor pulls the T-Bird up in front of the hotel and Lula hurries out to 
him and tosses their suitcase in the backseat.

				LULA
		Lets get outta here...  I suddenly

				SAILOR

		Gotta hex from a voodoo?

whistling.

94. INT. THUNDERBIRD

Lula and Sailor are motoring along.

				SAILOR
		Sweetheart, keep your panties up.
		Were in Jimmy Swaggart country.

Sailor and Lula both laugh.  Up ahead, Sailor spots a hitchhiker.  He 
slows to pick him up.

				LULA
		Sure you wanna do this?  Might be 
		a way they could track us.

				SAILOR
		Hes just a regular guyt needs help,
		honey.  Look at him.

The HITCHHIKER is a man about thirty with a pack on his back, and he is 
carrying a large, covered cardboard box.  He is filthy, with an uneven 
smile that exposes his jagged yellow teeth.  Lula opens the door for 
him, and after he loads his stuff, Sailor takes off down the highway.

				ROACH
		Thanks a lot.  I been standin out
		there off and on for two hours, ha-ha!
		Since noon about, ha-ha!  Cops catch
		ya hitchin on a Interstate around here
		they throw ya on a county road crew
		for a week, less you can pay the
		ticket, ha-ha!  Which I aint got, ha-ha!

				SAILOR
		My names Sailor, and this heres
		Lula.  Whats yours?

				ROACH
		Marvin DeLoach.  But everbody calls
		me Roach, ha-ha!  Roach DeLoach, ha-ha!

				LULA
		You always make that strange little
		funny laugh when you talk?

				ROACH
		Aint laughin, ha-ha!

				SAILOR
		What you got in the box?

				ROACH
		My dogs, ha-ha!

Roach slides the top off and tilts the box slightly toward the front.  
Inside are six small husky pups that are not more than two weeks old.

				ROACH
		Im headed to Alaska, ha-ha!  These
		dogs is gonna be my sled team, ha-ha!

				LULA
			(to Sailor)
		This guys crazy.

				SAILOR
		Where you from, Roach?

				ROACH
		If you mean where I was born, it was
		Belzoni, Missippi, ha-ha!  But I
		been brought up in Baton Rouge.

				LULA
		Why you goin to Alaska?  And whered
		you get them puppies?  They look sick.

Roach stares down into the box at the baby huskies and strokes each of 
them twice with a religiously unwashed hand.  The dogs whimper and lick 
his dirty fingers.

				ROACH
		I saw this movie on TV, ha-ha!  The
		Call of the Wild.  I aint never
		seen snow, ha-ha!  I got these dogs
		at the pound.  Nobody wanted em, 
		ha-ha!  Everbody here got theirself
		pit bulls or some kinda hounds.  Im
		gonna feed these boys good so theyll
		be big and powerful and they can pull
		me real fast through the snow, ha-ha!

Roach pulls a piece of raw cows liver out of one of his pockets of his 
field jacket and begins ripping little bits off it and feeding them to 
the dogs.

				LULA
		  (screeches as she sees this)
		Sailor!  Stop!  Stop the car now!

Sailor pulls off the road onto the shoulder of the highway and stops.  
Lula opens her door and jumps out.

				LULA
		Im sorry, but I cant take this.  
		Roach, or whatever your name is, you
		come out of there with them dogs
		this instant!

Roach sticks the liver back in his pocket and pulls his pack and the box 
of tiny canines after him.  Once he and his belongings are deposited on 
the roadside, Lula hops back in the car and slams the door.

				LULA
		Im truly sorry?  Im truly sorry, 
		Roach.  But aint gonna make it to
		Alaska?  Least not any part of the 
		way with us.  Youd best find a 
		party to take care of those dogs 
		proper, before they all die?  And, 
		if you dont mind my sayin so?  You
		could most certainly use some serious
		lookin after yourself, startin with
		a bath!

Lula takes a pair of sunglasses off the dashboard and puts them on.

				LULA
		Drive.

Sailor takes off.

				SAILOR
		You dont feel you was a little hard
		on the guy, honey?

				LULA
		I know youre thinkin that I got
		moren some of my mama in me?  Well,
		I couldnt help it.  Sailor, I really
		couldnt.  Im sorry for that guy,
		but when he pulled that drippin hunk
		of awful-smellin meat out of his
		pocket?  I near barfed.  And them

		You better get a move on, Johnnie,

We see Reggie and Drop Shadow enter the bar.  Reggies unsmiling eyes 
drift across the room until they see Johnnie in the booth.  He stares 
coldly and waits.  Drop Shadow adjusts his socks.

				JOHNNIE
		Really, Marietta, you got more

		I will, Marietta.  Goodbye now.

Johnnie hangs up the phone and exits the booth.  As he crosses the 
bar...

				REGGIE
			(shouting)
		Hola!  Senor Farragut!  We meet again.  

Johnnie goes over to Reggie and Drop Shadow and shakes hands.

				JOHNNIE
		I thought you two were in Austin, 
		Texas.  Or Takes-us, as they say in
		these parts.

				DROP SHADOW
		We were.  Now Mr. San Pedro Sula and
		I are on our way back to Utila, in
		the morning.

				REGGIE
		Would you like to enjoy a martini 
		with us?

				JOHNNIE
		Why not?  How was the fishin?

				REGGIE
		I think they are too serious, these
		American fishermen.  In Honduras, we
		are not so concerned with the method.

Reggie orders martinis for the three of them.

				JOHNNIE
		So, its back to the islands.

				DROP SHADOW
		Yes.  Mr. San Pedro Sula spoke 
		yesterday to his son, Archibald Leach
		San Pedro Sula, who is named after
		Cary Grant, and he told them there
		was a shooting.

				REGGIE
		Teddy Roosevelt, one of the local
		shrimp boat captains is in jail now.
		These people are friends of mine, so
		I must return and find out what 
		happened.

				JOHNNIE
		This island of yours sounds like a 
		kind of unpredictable place.  

				REGGIE
			(laughs)
		It has its moments of uncertainty.

				DROP SHADOW
		But how are you finding New Orleans,
		Senor Farragut?

				JOHNNIE
		Call me Johnnie...  N.O. has always
		been a good town to sit around in.


				REGGIE
		I can tell you are an intelligent
		man, Johnnie.  One difference between
		your country and mine is that in the
		islands, it does not pay to reveal
		ones intelligence...  Others may use
		what they perceive against us...

Reggie raises his glass to Johnnies.

				REGGIE
		Hasta siempre.

				JOHNNIE
		Hasta siempre.

				REGGIE
		Do you know how it came about that
		copper wire was invented in Scotland?

				JOHNNIE
		Hows that?

				DROP SHADOW
		Two Scotsmen were fighting over a

Johnnie finishes off his martini.

				JOHNNIE
		I gotta admit, you guys are

99. INT. CLUB ZANZIBAR - NIGHT

When they walk in, the BAND is playing a slow blues and THREE OR FOUR 
COUPLES are swaying on the dance floor.  There are a dozen tables and a 
long bar in the room which is done up in a strange dark azquatic motif.  
Eight of the tables are occupied and SIX OR SEVEN MEN stand at the bar.  
Everyone in the place is black except for one WHITE WOMAN who is sitting 
alone at a table smoking a cigarette and drinking Pearl straight from 
the bottle.  The atmosphere is not friendly, but Lula takes Sailor by 
the arm.

				LULA
		Come on.

They step up to the bar and order two Lone Star beers.  The BARTENDER, a 
tall, heavyset man slowly forms his hand into the bird.  He holds his 
hand that way while he speaks...

BARTENDER ZANZIBAR
		This is a friendly place, son.  You 
		folks just relax and have a nice time.

				LULA
		   (bound and determined not 
		    to be intimidated)
		You got yourself a deal.

				BARTENDER
			(to Sailor)
		Thats a real jacket...  By that,
		I mean a real stupid jacket.

				SAILOR
		This is a snakeskin jacket, and for
		me it represents a symbol of my 
		individuality and my belief in
		personal freedom.

				BARTENDER
		Fuckin honky cracker mumbo jumbo.


The bartender moves on down the bar.  Lula and Sailor take a small table 
near the door.

				LULA
		Ill be damned if Im leavin.  That
		band is too good?

				SAILOR
		Uh huh.

				LULA
		You notice that woman when we come
		in?  The white woman sittin by 
		herself?

				SAILOR
		Yeah.

				LULA
		Well, she aint talked to nobody

		I could tell.  What you make of that?

				SAILOR
		Honey, we bein strangers here and 
		all, this is the kinda place we dont
		want to make nothin of nothin.

				LULA
		You think shes pretty?

Sailor looks at the woman.  She lights a new cigarette off a butt, then 
squashes the butt in the ashtray.  She is thirty years old, maybe more.  
Shoulder-length, bleached blonde hair, black at the roots.  Clear skin, 
green eyes.  Long, straight nose with a small bump on it.  She is 
wearing a low-cut lavender dress that would have emphasized her breasts 
had she not been so flat-chested.  Slender.

				SAILOR
		I tend to like em with a little 
		more meat on the bones.  Face aint
		bad, though.

Lula gets quiet and sucks on her beer bottle.

				SAILOR
		Whats wrong, sweetheart?  Somethin
		botherin you?

				LULA
		Mama.  I been thinkin about her.
		Shes probly worried to death by now.

				SAILOR
		Moren likely.

				LULA
		I want to call her and tell her
		Im okay.  That were okay.

				SAILOR
		I aint so sure its a great idea,

		Pardon me?  Yall got a phone here

BARTENDER ZANZIBAR
		Cant you read?

Sailor finds her sitting on the ground, leaning against the passenger

		Told you not to call your mama.

Sailor stands and leans against the hood of the car until Lula gets up

dial.  Up comes a nationwide call-in talk show and she leaves it there.  
ARTIE MAYER, the radio host talks to his callers.

				ARTIE
		 (with a gruff Brooklyn accent)
		Come in, Montgomery, Alabama.

				CALLER #1
			(elderly sounding woman)
		Artie?  That you, Artie?

				ARTIE
		Yes, maam.  Whats on your almost-
		perfect mind this evening?

				CALLER #1
		How ya feelin, Artie?  I heard you
		wasnt doin too well recent.

				ARTIE
		Im fine, thank you.  I had a cardiac
		infarction but Im on a new diet and
		exercising regularly.  Ive never
		felt better.

				CALLER #1
		Well, thats so good to hear, Artie.
		You know some of us depend on you
		down this way.  Youre so entertainin
		and you get so many interestin guests.

				ARTIE
		Thank you.  Its listeners such as
		yourself who made me want to get up
		out of that hospital bed and back
		into the studio as fast as I could.

				LULA
		     (attacking the dial)
		Jesus!  How could anyone listen to
		this crap?

Lula takes a puff of her More and tosses it out the window and starts 
turning the radio dial - finds a news station.

				LULA
		HOLY SHIT!!  ITS THE NIGHT OF THE
		LIVIN FUCKIN DEAD!!!!

Sailor jumps awake in fright as Lula yanks the car off the road and 
brings it to a screeching halt in the middle of the desert.

				SAILOR
		Whats that, peanut?

				LULA
		I cant take no more of this radio...
			(switches it off)
		I aint never heard so much concentrated
		weirdness in my life, Sailor Ripley,

Sailor starts spinning the dial.

				LULA

		The worlds gettin worse, I think, 
		Sailor.  And it dont sound like 
		theres much we can do about it, 
		neither.

				SAILOR
		This aint news, sweetheart.  I 
		hate to tell ya.

Suddenly Sailor finds a station - THE STATION - and he and Lula look at 
each other in disbelief...

				SAILOR
		POWERMAD!!!

Sailor turns it up full blast and he and Lula dance hard until they 
disappear in the dust.

111. INT. MAISON VIOLETTE - LOBBY - NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT

Marietta and Johnnie are standing at the registration desk - talking to 
the HOTEL MANAGER.

				MANAGER
		Heres your key.  Mr. Farraguts 
		already taken care of everything.
		I hope youll be comfortable, Mrs.
		Fortune.  Youre in room 351 right 
		down the hall from Mr. Farragut.

The DESK CLERK steps in from a room behind the registration desk.

				DESK CLERK
		I have a phone call for you, Mrs. 
		Fortune ... at the phone by the 
		fireplace.  Please wait for it to ring.

Marietta looks at Johnnie.  She goes to the phone and picks it up when 
it rings.

				MARIETTA
		Yes?...

112. INT. HOTEL ROOM - NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT

Marcello Santos sits on the edge of his bed holding the telephone.

				SANTOS
		I got your message...  But you went

		I cant trust you, bitch - not for

		Sailor and Lula are headed west, and
		guess what?  Theres no turning back.
		Im in a killing mood.

He hangs up the phone.

114. INT. MR. REINDEERS PRIVATE DINING ROOM - NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT

Upstairs in a private dining room, Mr. Reindeer is dining with TWELVE 
GUESTS in formal evening attire.  Behind him, a JAZZ TRIO and a 
STRIPTEASE ARTIST are hard at work.  Mr. Reindeer smiles and leans over 
very close to a beautiful WOMAN sitting to his left.

				MR. REINDEER
		Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet, 
		eating her curds and whey...  Along
		came a spider and sat down beside her,
		and extended his hand out to play.

With this, he reaches under the table between her legs.  She turns red 
and Mr. Reindeer laughs and lights a cigarette.

				MR. REINDEER
		Oh dear...  Another Miss Dull Cunt.

Reggie and Drop Shadow enter through a door on the other side of the 
room.  Reggie catches Mr. Reindeers eye and smiles.  Reggie reaches in 
his pocket and takes out a silver dollar - flips it in the air - catches 
it - and puts it back in his pocket.  Mr. Reindeer smiles and waves him 
over to the table.  He whispers something in Reggies ear - then gives 
him an envelope.

				MR. REINDEER
		When I gave you the silver dollar I
		forgot to give you the contents of
		this envelope.  They are to be 
		returned.  Show it just before the deed...

Reggie pockets the envelope - joins Drop Shadow - and as they are 
leaving the dining room, they join a woman, JUANA, who looks half-
Oriental, half-Cajun.  She wears a strange, short, yellowish-bleached 
blonde wig.

115. INT. GALATOIRES RESTAURANT - NIGHT

They go downstairs together.  At the bottom of the stairs, Reggie and 
Drop Shadow catch sight of Johnnie who is sitting in the back of the 
restaurant having dinner with Marietta.  When Johnnie sees the two of 
them he waves, but at the same time gets a chill up his spine.

				MARIETTA
		What is it, Johnnie?

				JOHNNIE
		Just some guys I met here...  I 
		keep seein em...
			(looks back at Marietta)
		Now tell me...

Marietta continues to stare at Reggie, Drop Shadow, and Juana before 
turning back to Johnnie.  She also feels the fear.

				MARIETTA
		Johnnie, I cant tell you, honey.  Is
		there anyway we can get on the road
		tonight?  Weve got to find them kids.

				JOHNNIE
		Somethin was upsettin you bad last
		night, and you wanted to tell me
		and I figured you wanted to tell me
		sos I could help...

				MARIETTA
		I did, honey, but that was last 
		night...  Lets just find those two
		kids before its too late.

				JOHNNIE
		Honey, I have to ask you this...
		Is Santos involved in any of this?

				MARIETTA
		Hell no, baby...  I wouldnta done

				JOHNNIE

				MARIETTA
		Who?...  Uncle Pooch?...

				JOHNNIE
		Yeah...  The one that introduced

				MARIETTA

				JOHNNIE

		All I have to do is grab my suitcase,

Johnnie smiles and heads up to his room.  He opens the door and steps 
inside.  WHAM!!  Johnnie is knocked in the head with a heavy metal pipe 
and he goes down hard.  A large dark figure grabs on to him and pulls 
him to an open window and lowers him into the back of a pick-up.  The
dark figure follows out the window.

DISSOLVE TO:


117. INT. MAISON VIOLETTE - LOBBY - NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT

Marietta is sitting in the lobby trying to hold herself together - half-
sobbing.  The MANAGER approaches and sits next to her.

				MANAGER
		Im afraid his car is gone, Mrs.
		Fortune.

				MARIETTA
		I dont understand this...  I dont
		understand this one bit.  He was 
		supposed to meet me right her in 
		this lobby.  Somethin bad has 
		happened - I jus know it.

				MANAGER
		Perhaps we should call a local law
		enforcement officer.

				MARIETTA
		HELL NO!!!  Thats the last thing 
		we need...  A buncha cops runnin
		around.

The front desk clerk steps from behind his desk and hurries into the 
lobby.

				DESK CLERK
		Im sorry...  But I have overlooked
		this.  Im truly sorry, maam.

He hands Marietta a note inside an envelope which she opens and reads 
immediately.  We see the note.  

NOTE
Gone fishing with a friend - maybe
buffalo hunting.  Johnnie.


				MARIETTA
		Oh God!  What does that mean?

				MANAGER
		Im sure I wouldnt know, maam ...
		and buffalo hunting too ... hmmmmm?

				MARIETTA
		And jus when my babys out on some
		Texas road with a killer.

The front door of the hotel opens and in walks Santos.  He seems to know 
exactly where Marietta is and steps to the door of the sitting room off 
the lobby.  He stands in the doorway and smiles at Marietta.

				MARIETTA
			(horrified whisper)
		Santos...  Wheres J-J-Johnnie?

				SANTOS
		Shhhhhh...
			(to the manager and desk clerk)
		Thank you, gentlemen...  Ill look
		after her now...

The Manager and Desk Clerk bow to Marietta and Santos and go back 
through the lobby.  Santos walks over to Marietta.  Marietta stands.

				MARIETTA
		Santos...  Whats happenin here?

				SANTOS
		Hey...  Stop the nervous cry-baby
		routine...  Youre my girl now...
		Santos is gonna wipe away those tears
		and make you happy...  Come on, lets
		get outta here.

				MARIETTA
		Where we goin?

				SANTOS
		Got word the kids are moving through
		Texas...  I think an ending is being

119. INT. SMALL HUT - DESERTED BAYOU - NIGHT

Johnnie is tied to a small wooden straight-backed chair.  His mouth is 
gagged and taped shut.  His hair is caked with dry blood and one fresh 
tickle curls down his forehead to his eyes which are just now beginning 
to open and focus.  Juana is finishing tying his left ankle to the chair 
leg.  Johnnie moans and Juana brings her big, smiling face up in front 
of his.

				JUANA
		Johnnie, you take a good look at me,
		baby, cause you gonna hafta watch
		close to know when we do it to ya...
		Yall count when I touch the bottle -

		pay attention fucka - otherwise we 
		hafta work it all night...  Too 
		much fun for us - you see what I 
		mean?  Now watch me how I touch a
		bottle and you count how many times.

Juana steps two paces across the hut where two dirty old soda bottles 
sit - one in one corner perched on a dried tree trunk - the other in the 
opposite corner perched on an old fence post.  Juana touches the left 
bottle (#1) once, and crosses and touches the right bottle (#2) once and 
comes back and touches Johnnies face.

				JUANA
		You see, Johnnie.  I toucha number
		one bottle once, I toucha number two
		bottle once, and I touch your face.
		This is a game we love to play.  I
		get hot already...  Now you meet 
		second Mr. Killer...  Does he fish
		or dont he?

Reggie and Drop Shadow step out of the darkness behind Johnnie and come 
around to face him.

				REGGIE
		Hey, Johnnie...  Reggie - you remember
		Reggie, dont ya?  Look what I caught.
			(to Juana)
		Im gettin hot too, mama.

Reggie and Juana kiss hot in front of Johnnie.  Juana puts her face down 
in front of Johnnies again.

				JUANA
		Now Johnnie...  We want to feel the

		I cant stop her, Johnnie...  She
		gets me too hot doin this...  Im

Reggie reaches his hand around in front of Johnnie - showing him a .45 
Automatic.

				DROP SHADOW
		Thats a Marine issue.  It goes off
		somethin terrible - you wanna see?

Drop Shadow pulls the hammer back which makes a loud click.

				JUANA
		You hear click?

Johnnie jumps as Drop Shadow blows a big hole in the far wall in front 
of Johnnie.

				REGGIE
			(laughs)
		Hell, its even worse than I 
		remember...  Wait a minute...

Reggie comes out in front of Johnnie - Juana grabs him.  They kiss hot 
again.

				JUANA
		Okay, gimmee nother kiss, Reggie
		bfore I fuck ya right now...
		FUCKIN HOT NOW, REGGIE.
		    (she opens her mouth with 
		     her tongue sticking out)
		FUCKIN HOT!

Juana screams like a monster from hell coming up close to Johnnies 
face.

				JUANA
		You think you gonna live through

		SMELL YO SHIT NOW, JOHNNIE.  GIVE
		US ONE MO KISS, REGGIE.  OH FUCK

				JUANA

		...  REGGIE...  YOU SHOW NOW-

Reggie reaches his hand around Johnnies face - tears off tape and gag - 
then opens his hand and shows Johnnie a cufflink with a particular 
design in turquoise, orange, and silver.

				REGGIE
		I forgot to show you this.  The
		gentlemen that gave this to me said
		youd recognize it.  Said he wanted 
		itd be bout the last thing you ever
		saw in this life.

				JOHNNIE

  Oh God...  OH GOD...  Santos...

				JUANA
		I GO ROUND AND ROUND - DO I TOUCH A
		SECOND BOTTLE BFORE I TOUCH JOHNNIE
		- DO I?  DO I???.........
		    (very quietly and breathy)
		No...  I touch Johnnie.

As her finger touches Johnnies face there is a loud CLICK.  Johnnie 
moans and closes his eyes.

				JUANA
			(counting fast)
		One ... two ... three ... four ...
		five ... GETTIN TOO FUCKIN HOT,

Johnnie starts to scream and violently try to move out of his chair.

				JUANA
		Nine...
		   (she moves out of the way)
		FUCK ME NOW, REGGIE...  TEN!!!

We see a hole in the front of the barrel - BOOM!!!

The opposite wall and bottles get covered with blood.  Juana and Reggie 
race into each others arms and kiss right above Johnnies dead, 
bloodied head.

The livingroom is on fire and we move upstairs - Lula races through the 
smoke-filled hallway to her mothers bedroom.

The livingroom is on fire and Lula throws open the door to her mothers 
bedroom just in time to see Marcello Santos leaving through a window.  
Her mother laughs a wild, crazy laugh - exactly the same laugh Lula 
heard on the porch of the Cape Fear Hotel.

				LULA

		Whats that?

				SAILOR
		I dont know...  Looks like clothes.

Sailor starts to slow down.  The highway is suddenly littered with 
clothes strewn everywhere and two open suitcases smashed near the side 
of the road.  Sailor slows down to a crawl.  He and Lula turn to each 
other - theyve just seen TWO DEAD BODIES.  One close to the side of the 
highway - and other just off in the desert brush.  Off behind is an 
overturned car.

				LULA
		Oh God, Sailor.


				SAILOR
		One bad car accident...

				LULA
		SAILOR!!!

Coming out of the darkness is a YOUNG GIRL, her clothes half torn off - 
blood draining out of several deep wounds.

				LULA
		Sailor, what are we gonna do?

				SAILOR
		I dont know, honey, but we gotta 
		help that girl - get her to a town and
		hope no one catches on I broke parole.

They get out of the car and the girl comes toward them screaming.

				GIRL

		Ive got about five hundred dollars

		My mothers going to kill me.  Its 
		got all my cards in it...  It was

		MY PURSE IS GONE!!!  NOW SHE TELLS ME.

The girl starts walking back toward the car.

				SAILOR
		Lets get ahold a her quick.

				LULA
		You think shes gonna make it?

				SAILOR
		Dont know, but shes gonna bleed
		all over our car, Ill tell ya that...
		           (to Girl)
		Hey...  Hello...  Girl...  You gotta
		come with us, honey.

Sailor reaches out cautiously and takes hold of the girls arm.

				GIRL
		OWWW GOD!!!  LEAVE ME ALONE...
		ROBERT!!!...  Shit, I got this damn
		sticky stuff in my hair...

She keeps digging her fingers into a bloody wound in her head.

				GIRL
		Gotta find my wallet.
			(to Sailor)
		Dont you say one word of this to
		my mother.  God, shes gonna kill me.

The girls falls to one knee and struggles to get back up.  Sailor and 
Lula each take an arm and try to help her.

				GIRL
		WHERES MY HAIRBRUSH?...

Sailor and Lula help the girl stand, but her eyes start rolling back and 
a bunch of fresh blood comes gushing up out of her mouth.

				LULA
		I cant take this, Sailor.  Shes
		dyin right in front of our eyes...

				SAILOR
		Im afraid she is, baby.

Sailor kneels down next to the girl and runs his hand gently across her 
forehead.

				GIRL
			(wide-eyed now)
		Get my lipstick...
			(whisper)
		Its in my purse.

The girl dies.  Sailor and Lula hold real still for a moment.  Lula 
starts to cry.

				LULA
		She died right in front of me.  Whyd
		she have to go and do that, Sailor?

				SAILOR
		Lets get outta here, honey.

Before getting up, Sailor lets his hand come off the girls forehead 
down over her eyes - closing them.  He puts his hand on her cheek then 
gets up.  He puts his arm around Lula and they go back to her car.  
Sailor helps Lula in on her side and closes the door for her.  He goes 
around, gets in and looks over at Lula, who breaks down crying harder.  
Sailor starts the car and takes off.

The Thunderbird drives past a large stucco fish on a rock stand which 
has a sign on it that says BIG TUNA, TEXAS.  Sailor cruises the T-Bird 
along the main street of Big Tuna, eye-balling the place.

				SAILOR
		Well, it aint exactly Emerald City...

				LULA
		Not quite as bad as the weather though...
		It must be a hundred and ten and it 
		aint even noon yet.


123A. EXT. IGUANA MOTEL - MORNING

Sailor pulls the car up in front of the Iguana Motel.

				SAILOR
		Thisll do.

								CUT TO:

124. INT. IGUANA MOTEL - DAY

The room is simple: double bed, dresser, mirror, chair, sink, toilet, 
bathtub (no shower), electric fan, window overlooking the street.

				SAILOR
		Not bad for eleven dollars a day.

				LULA
		No radio or TV...

She strips off the spread, tosses it in a corner and sits down on the 
bed.

				LULA
		And no AC.

				SAILOR
		Fan works.

				LULA
		Now what?

				SAILOR
		Lets get a sandwich and find out
		about some work.

				LULA
		Sailor?

				SAILOR
		Yeah?

				LULA
		This aint exactly my most thrillin
		notion of startin a new life.

They stare at each other.  Lula suddenly feels sick to her stomach and 
slumps down on the edge of the bed.

				LULA
		Im gonna stay here in this room, 
		Sailor.  I dont feel so good?  This
		heat makes me tired.

				SAILOR
		Okay, honey, Ill see you later.

								CUT TO:

125. EXT. REDS GARAGE - DAY

A tall, skinny man, RED, in his early thirties with wild, uncombed hair 
the color of pomegranate, walks out of the garage.

				SAILOR
		You Red?

				RED
			(with a smile)
		Well, I aint Blackie.

Sailor holds out his right hand to shake.

				SAILOR
		Names Sailor Ripley.  Katy over at
		the drugstore thought you might have
		some work I could do.

Red extends his oil-blackened right hand and shakes.

				RED
		Things aint real hot right now.
		Rex, there though,
			(nodding toward a half-naked
			man burrowed under an 83 Buick)
		is about to relocate in about a week
		to San Angelo.  I might could use a
		man when he does...  You good with
		engines?

				SAILOR
		I aint no Enzo Ferrari, but they 
		used to call me Wrench when I was a
		kid.

				RED
		Well see how she goes then when
		Rex takes off.  Check back.

Two men, SPARKY and BUDDY, both about forty, walk up to Red.  One of 
them wears a grey baseball cap with a Confederate flag on it and the 
other has an LBJ straw Stetson.

				SPARKY
		Hows it look?

				RED
		Reckon the heads cracked, like I
		thought.

				SPARKY
		Shit, thats what I was afraid of.

				RED
		Ill get you foreigners a beer.



				BUDDY
			(to Sailor)
		Im Buddy, and this heres Sparky.

Sailor introduces himself to Sparky and Buddy and Rex.  They all shake 
hands or nod and move out of the sun to drink their beers.

				SAILOR
		My girl and I are lookin for a 
		place to settle.  Were bunked down
		at the Iguana Motel.

				SPARKY
		So are we.  Its the only motel in 
		Big Tuna.  Have you met Bobby Just
		Like The Country Peru yet?

				SAILOR
		No, we just got in a hour and a 
		half ago.

				BUDDY
		You will.  Hes the Mr. Fix-It at 
		the Iguana.  His truck broke down 
		here a couple of months ago.

				REX
		Escaped con.  Man got some serious
		prison tattoos.

				RED
		Everbody got a past.

				BUDDY
		Just some got more future in em
		than others.

				REX
		That aint no lie.

Sailor finishes his beer, stands it on the ground and steps on it, 
crushing it flat.

				SAILOR
		Been nice meetin yall.  Preciate
		the beer.  Ill be seein yall
		soon.

				BUDDY
		Very soon.

				SPARKY
		One thing about bein in Big Tuna:
		you dont have much choice about who 
		you see and who you dont.

								CUT TO:

126. EXT. IGUANA BANK - DAY

The temperature on the tower reads One Hundred Twelve.

CUT TO:								

127. INT. IGUANA MOTEL - DAY

In front of the door there is a large, damp spot on the rug where about 
a hundred and fifty flies are buzzing and landing.  Sailor sees this 
when he opens the door.  He steps across the large spot and finds Lula 
just waking up on the bed.

				LULA
		That you, Sail, honey?

				SAILOR
		The only one.

Lula opens her eyes and looks at him.

				LULA
		You find any work?

				SAILOR
		Maybe.  Met a guy named Red, owns a
		garage, could have some work in
		about a week.  Met a few hard luck
		boys whos stayin here.  Whats
		that smell?

				LULA
		I barfed.  Tried to make it to the
		bathroom...  Turned out it was the
		wrong door anyways...  I sorta got
		it cleaned up.

				SAILOR
		You sick?

				LULA
		A little, I think...  Darlin?

				SAILOR
		Yeah?

				LULA
		Come sit by me.

Sailor goes over and sits on the bed.

				LULA
		I dont know that this is the right
		place for us.

Sailor strokes Lulas head.

				SAILOR
		It aint gonna be forever, peanut.

Lula closes her eyes.

				LULA
		I know, Sailor.  Nothin is.

								CUT TO:

128. EXT. SKY OVER BIG TUNA - EVENING

The darkening evening sky is filled with flying monkeys.

								CUT TO:

129. INT. IGUANA MOTEL - COURTYARD - NIGHT

Sailor, Lula, Sparky, and Buddy are sitting in the courtyard of the 
motel sharing Sparkys fifth of Ezra Brooks.  An electric bug killer is 
working overtime.  Buddy is reading from a newspaper.

				BUDDY
		     (reading from paper)
		Robert Brenton, twenty-five, was 
		killed when his car went off the road
		on State Highway 118, according to the
		Department of Public Safety.  Brenton
		and two passengers, William Reese and
		Susan Day, were thrown from the 
		automobile, reports said.

Sailor looks at Lula.

				SAILOR
		Susan Day...

The assistant manager, TOMMY THOMPSON, speaks from the shadows behind 
the group.

				TOMMY
		Robert Brenton, that dumb fuck.  That
		stupid shit...  That fuckin Bob was
		so fuckin dumb...  He deserved to
		die...  That asshole.

They all look over at Tommy.

				BUDDY
		Hey, Tommy...  Whats goin on over
		there in number four where al them 
		bright lights are all the time?

				TOMMY
		Them are makin a pornographic movie...
		Texas style...  Why?  You wanna join in?

				SPARKY
		How do you get sixteen Haitians into
		a Dixie Cup?

				LULA
		How?

				SPARKY
		Tell em it floats.

				BUDDY
		Sparkys big on Florida jokes.

				SPARKY
		You need a active sense of humor to
		survive in the Big Tuna.

BOBBY PERU walks in and comes over.

				BOBBY
		Hey, everybody.

				BUDDY
		Sailor, Lula, this heres the man 
		himself.  Bobby, this is Sailor
		and Lula, the most recent strandees,
		economic variety.

Bobby nods to Lula and offers a hand to Sailor.

				BOBBY
		Bobby Peru, just like the country.

Sparky and Buddy laugh.

				BUDDY
		Accordin to Red and Rex, Bobbys
		the most excitin item to hit Big
		Tuna since the 86 cyclone sheared
		the roof off the high school.

				SPARKY
		Only in town two months and there 
		aint a young thing around dont 
		know how that cobra tattoo works, 
		right, Bob?

Bobby laughs.  He has a lopsided grin that exposes only three brownish 
front teeth and he has flat black eyes that seem to reflect no light.

				LULA
		You from Texas, Mr. Peru?

Bobby pulls up a chair and pours himself a shotglass full of whiskey.

				BOBBY
		Im from all over.

				SAILOR
		    (noticing a USMC tattoo
		     on Bobbys right hand)
		You was in the Marines, huh?

Bobby looks down at his hand, flexs it.

				BOBBY
		Four years.

				SPARKY
		Bobby was at Cao Ben.

				LULA
		Whats Cao Ben?

				BOBBY
			(to Lula)
		How old are you?

				LULA
		Twenty.

				BUDDY
		Lotta women and kids and old people
		died at Cao Ben.

				BOBBY
		March, 1968.  We torched a village
		and the government made a big deal
		out of it.

Bobby sips the whiskey and closes his eyes for several seconds before 
reopening them and looking at Buddy.  His eyes open slowly and they 
practically burn a hole in Buddy.

				BOBBY
			(to Buddy)
		You was on a ship, pardner.  Hard to
		make contact with the people when
		youre off floatin in the Gulf of
		Tonkin.

				SPARKY
		    (changing the subject)
		Hey Bobby, have yourself another 
		glass a Jack.

Sparky refills Bobbys shotglass.  Bobby tosses it back in one gulp.

				BOBBY
		Dont mind if I fuckin do...  
		Speakin a Jack...  One-eyed Jacks
		yearnin to go a peepin in a
		seafood store...  Good meetin you.
		Adios, boys.

He walks out and after hes gone...

				LULA
		Somethin in that man scares me.

				BUDDY
		No shit.


				SPARKY
		  (pouring himself another shot)
		Bobbys got a way...  Cant shake
		that institution odor.

Lula puts a hand on Sailors leg.

				LULA
		Darlin, I still aint feelin so 
		well.  Im goin to bed.

				SAILOR
		Ill come along.

They say goodnight to Sparky and Buddy and head for their room.

								CUT TO:

130. INT. IGUANA MOTEL - SAILOR AND LULAS ROOM - NIGHT

				SAILOR
		Man, that barf smell dont fade fast.

Lula goes right to the bed and flops down on it.

				SAILOR
		Anything I can do for you?

				LULA
		No, I dont think so, Sail.  I
		just need to lie down.

Lula listens to Sailor brush his teeth, urinate into the toilet and 
flush it.  Sailor comes out of the bathroom and climbs into bed.

				LULA
		Sailor?  You know what?

				SAILOR
		I know you aint particularly pleased
		bein here.

				LULA
		Not that.  Look at what I wrote down
		cause I cant say it.

Lula hands Sailor a note which reads Im pregnant.  Sailor looks into 
her eyes.

				SAILOR
		Its okay by me, peanut.

				LULA
		Well, nothin personal, but I aint
		sure its okay by me.

Sailor crumples the note and puts it in the ashtray.


				LULA
		Really, Sailor, it aint nothin 
		against you.  I love you.

				SAILOR
		Love you, too.

				LULA
		I know.  Just Im sorta uncomfortable
		about the way some things is goin,
		and this dont help soothe me.

				SAILOR
		I know this aint easy, Lula, but
		I aint gonna let things get no
		worse, I promise.

CU of Lula setting fire to the pregnant note in the ashtray.

DISSOLVE TO:


131. INT. IGUANA MOTEL - SAILOR AND LULAS ROOM - DAY

CU of flies on vomit stain.

There is a knock on the door which wakes Lula from her nap.  She opens 
the door.  Bobby Peru stands outside.

				BOBBY
		Hey, pretty woman...  Sailor here?

				LULA
		No, hes out changin the oil in
		the car.

				BOBBY
		Man, I gotta take a piss bad...  Can
		I use your head there?

				LULA
		Well...  Yeah - okay.

				BOBBY
		I dont mean your head head - Im
		not gonna piss on your head - your
		hair an all...  Just piss in the
		toilet.  Yall take a listen - 
		here a deep sound comin down from
		Bobby Peru.

Bobby enters the bathroom and starts to urinate.

								CUT TO:

132. EXT. PERDITA DURANGOS HOUSE - DAY

Sailor pulls the T-Bird up front and hurries up to the screen door.  
Flies are buzzing all around.  PERDITA DURANGO comes forward out of the 
darkness inside.

				PERDITA
			(recognizing him)
		Oh...  Look at this...  What do you
		want, snakeskin?

				SAILOR
		Just passin through on my way to
		who knows where...

				PERDITA
		Sure...  I figured Id see you 
		sometime...

				SAILOR
		Hopin you could tell me if theres
		a contract out on me.  I really
		need to know.

				PERDITA
		By who?

				SAILOR
		I think Santos or Marietta Fortune.

				PERDITA
		Heard you was goin out with that
		bitchs daughter.

				SAILOR
		You heard right.

				PERDITA
		You really are one dumb asshole.

				SAILOR
		Life is unpredictable.

				PERDITA
		Does that girlfriend of yours know
		that her mama and Santos killed her
		daddy?
			(Sailor doesnt answer -
			Perdita smiles)
		Does she know her own daddy was one 
		of the biggest drug dealers around -
		till he started snortin the shit 
		himself?...
			(Sailor doesnt answer)
		Does she know you was around that 
		night her daddy was set fire to?

				SAILOR
		I didnt see nothin...

				PERDITA
		Yeah...  But I did...  And I told you
		all about it...

				SAILOR
		Is there a contract?...  We made a
		deal once that wed tip each
		other off if we ever heard.

				PERDITA
		I know...  I remember.

				SAILOR
		Well?...

				PERDITA
		I aint heard of nothin.

				SAILOR
		Thanks...

Sailor goes back to his car and takes off.

								CUT TO:

133. INT. INGUANA MOTEL - SAILOR AND LULAS ROOM - DAY

Bobby is pacing around the room.

				BOBBY
		Hey...  You gotta smell in this room
		of puke...  You been pukin in here,
		little girl?  Huh?...  You sick?...
		Pregnant?

				LULA
			(flinches)
		You used the toilet, now you can go

				BOBBY
		You know, I really do like a woman

		Huh?...  Cause baby, Ill fuck you

				LULA

				BOBBY
		Am I scarin ya?...  Your pussy wet?

		Hey, dont jump back so slow...  I

		Mean somethin, dont it?...  Means
		somethin to me...  Means you want
		Bobby Peru...  You want Bobby Peru
		to fuck you hard baby - open you

Suddenly Bobby jumps back, shakes his head and straightens his hair.

				BOBBY
		Hey...  Im sorry...  I dont think
		Im bein too polite here ... and
		I apologize...  Hell...  A man sees
		a pretty woman and first thing he
		knows, he loses his manners...  Sure

		Id like to fuck you and tear you

		Will you be honest with me - would

		simple yes or no...

He steps a little closer to her.

				BOBBY
		Just feel me breathin on you...
		And youll know I mean business when
		it comes to fuckin.

With all the strength she can muster, Lula slaps Bobby across the face.

				LULA
		GET OUT!!!

Bobby grabs on to her hard.

				BOBBY
		Bobby Peru grab you now...  Hold
		you tight...  Feel everythin in you
		now...  Stay quiet...  Say fuck me
		and then Ill leave.

				LULA

		No way...  GET OUT!!!

				BOBBY
		Say it!...  ILL TEAR YOUR FUCKIN

		soft - then Ill leave.  Say fuck

		leave...  Say it...  Say it -  Say

Bobby moves in very close to her - Lulas trembling.  Bobby puts his 
hand on her neck and moves it up and down behind her ear.

				BOBBY
		Say it...  Then Ill leave...  Whisper
		it...  Whisper it...  Whisper it...
		Whisper fuck me...

His hand moves down over her breasts - down across her stomach - and 
down.  Lulas left hand opens and spreads wide.

				BOBBY
		Whisper it...  Whisper fuck me...
		Whisper...  Whisper...  Whisper...
		Whisper...

				LULA
			(whispers)
		Fuck me.

				BOBBY
		Someday honey, I will...  But I

Bobby leaves smiling and slams the door.  Lula stands trembling clicking 
her heels together.

Sailor is just about finished changing the oil in the Thunderbird when 
Bobby Peru pulls up in the maroon Eldo.

				BOBBY
		Need a hand?

		Thanks, Bobby, bout done.

Sailor throws some stuff in the trunk and closes the lid.

				BOBBY
		How bout a beer?

				SAILOR
		Thatd be fine, Bobby.

				BOBBY
		Lets go by Rosaritas.  You been

They enter a long, dark room where a DOZEN MEN, most of them wearing 
cowboy hats, sit on stools at a bar drinking beer out of frosted mugs.

				BOBBY
		No hard liquor here.  Just beer.

They claim two stools.

				BOBBY
		Couple Stars, Jimmy.

The BARTENDER brings over two bottle and two mugs - then walks back to 
the other end of the bar.

				SAILOR

				BOBBY

DISSOLVE TO:


LATER

Bobby returns from the jukebox and sits down next to Sailor.

				BOBBY
		Q-7, three times.  Pee Wee Kings
		Waltz of Regret, my favorite tune.

Pee Wees steel guitar ripples through the cigarette haze and buzzes 
around Sailors head.  His reflection wobbles in the long mirror behind 
the bar.

				BOBBY
		I been studyin a situation over in
		Lobo, take two men to handle it.

				SAILOR
		Whats that?

				BOBBY
		Feed store keeps up to five K in
		their safe.  Need me a good boy for
		back-up.  Even split.  You interested?

Sailor stares at Bobby and works hard to focus his eyes.

				SAILOR
		No...  I dont think so, man.

				BOBBY
		Be easy, Sailor.  Theres two employees.
		I take one in the back to open the
		safe, you keep the othern covered...
		You aint plannin on raisin a

				SAILOR

				BOBBY
			(smiling)
		Well...  I mean like Lula bein in

				SAILOR
		   (a tinge of jealousy/fear)
		Lula tell you shes pregnant?

Bobby grins, showing those three brown teeth.

				BOBBY
		Couple grand or mored give you two
		a leg up.  Get you to the west
		coast, Mexico, most anyplace, with
		a few dollars in your jeans.  I 
		got it figured good, Sailor.

				SAILOR
		When did you talk to Lula?

				BOBBY
		Talked to her this afternoon...
		While you was out.

				SAILOR
		She really say she was pregnant?

				BOBBY

		Just took a guess is all...  You

		I aint fuckin sure, Bobby.

				BOBBY
		Dont think about it too long.

		You had enough?

				SAILOR
			(finishing his beer)
		Have now.

				BOBBY
		Come on outside, I got somethin 
		to show ya.


136A. EXT. ROARITAS - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Bobby looks around in the purple twilight before he opens the trunk of 
the Eldorado.  He peels back a brown army blanket.

				BOBBY
		Thats a double-barreled, sawed-off,
		Ithaca shotgun with a carved pistol
		grip stock wrapped with adhesive tape.
		Next to its a cold Smith and Wesson
		.32 handgun with a six inch barrel.
		Thesell do er...  Loosen up that
		five grand...  Two and a half for you
		and the little lady...

Bobby closes the trunk.  Sailor stands - hesitating to commit.

				BOBBY
		How much money you have between the
		two aya right now?...

				SAILOR
		Forty bucks...

				BOBBY
		This is easy money, pardner...  No
		ones gonna get hurt in this thing...
		And I dont think you can afford not
		to take it...  Ill be bringin the
		Eldo round the front of the motel
		at ten tomorrow mornin...  If you
		aint a pussy - youll be there.

Sailor stares at him and his fist clenches.

				SAILOR
		I dont particularly care for that
		kind of talk, Bobby.

				BOBBY
		Hey...  I never said you was a pussy...
		Always figured you had the big ol
		round balls for this kinda thing...
		Sure would set you and that pretty
		little girl up good.

				SAILOR
		Yeah ... yeah...  I guess so...
		That kinda moneyd get us a long 
		way down that yellow brick road...

Bobby cocks his head and squints at him questioningly.

				SAILOR

		Few beers is all.  Feelin any better?

Lula rolls onto her back.

				LULA

				SAILOR
		Were goin to, Lula, real soon.

				LULA
		Rather be in El Paso than Big Tuna.

Sailor gets into bed.

				SAILOR
		You shouldnt be smokin if youre

Lula sticks a More between her lips and lights it.  She takes a deep 
drag, blows out the smoke, and stares at Sailor.

				LULA
		Who says Im smart?  You up to 
		somethin with Bobby Peru, Sailor?

				SAILOR
		What could I be up to, Lula?

				LULA
		Hes a stone fuckin criminal, honey,

				SAILOR
		I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didnt I?

				LULA
		That was a accident.  I bet both our

				SAILOR
		That was in Vietnam.

				SAILOR
		What?

				LULA
		Was a massacre.  Soldiers there 
		murdered old folks, women and babies,
		and dumped em in a trench.  Bobby
		Peru probly killed the most.

				SAILOR
		Lula, he mighta did, I dont know.
		But it dont matter now.  Lotta guys
		go outta control in a war and it 
		aint their fault.

Lula puffs hard on her cigarette.

				LULA
		I sure enjoy smokin, Sailor.  I 
		hate that its bad for you.

Sailor turns on his side, away from Lula, and pulls a pillow over his 
head.

				LULA
		That mans a black angel, Sailor.
		You hook up with him, youll regret
		it.  If you live to.

S				AILOR
		Thanks, darlin, I know you got my
		best interest in mind, and I
		preciate it sincerely.  I love 
		you, but I gotta sleep now.

Lula lights a second More off the first one and stubs out the butt on 
the dresser top.  

				LULA
		This whole worlds wild at heart and
		weird on top.

Lula turns over, away from Sailor.

				LULA
			(softly)
		I wish you really, truly loved me...
		I wish youd sing me Love Me Tender
		...  I wish I was somewhere over 
		that rainbow...  Shit.  Shit, shit,

CU of Sailors eyes - he remembers.

138. INT. BAY ST. CLEMENT HOTEL - STAIRCASE - NIGHT

Sailor and Lula are walking down the carpeted stairs when Sailor is 
called by BOB RAY LEMON, who is coming down towards them fast.  Marietta 
stands at the top - watching.

				BOB RAY
		Hey Sailor...  Wait a minute...  I
		got somethin for ya.

As Bob Ray passes Lula on the stairs - he puts his hand between her 
legs.  Sailor starts to see red.  Bob Ray smiles and steps down to 
Sailor.  He leans in and whispers in Sailors ear.

				BOB RAY
		Shit, man...  Marietta says you been 
		tryin to fuck her in the toilets 
		for the past ten minutes...  You
		crazy fuckin bad boy tryin to 
		fuck your girls mama...  How do
		you think that cute little cunt Lula
		would feel about that?  Hey, take a
		look at this...
			(shows Sailor one thousand
			dollars in cash)
		Marietta just gave me this to kill
		you right now, and afterward she
		said Lula was mine to fuck all the
		way into next Sunday.

Bob Ray pulls a knife, but Sailors fist is already halfway through Bob 
Rays brain.  From there, Sailor steps firmly into the crazy zone.  
Amidst blood-curdling hysterical screams from a growing throng of 
SOUTHERN BELLES, Sailor starts taking Bob Ray apart limb by limb and 
doesnt stop until Bob Ray lays completely destroyed and completely dead 
at the foot of the stairs.  The crowd of formally dressed onlookers 
stand aghast.  Sailor stares up at Marietta.  Both their eyes burning 
with hate.

Sailor is dripping with sweat.  His teeth are clenched tight and his 
fists violently grip the sheets, as if any minute he could tear the bed 
apart.

140. INT. PERDITA DURANGOS HOUSE - NIGHT

Bobby lets the screen door bang shut behind him as he comes in and roams 
around the livingroom.

				PERDITA
		Nice of you to drop by.

				BOBBY
		Told ya I would.  You still riled?

				PERDITA
			(laughs)
		You still screwing sixteen-year-olds
		in the ass?

Bobby keeps circling.

				BOBBY
		Aint never had no girl pull a blade
		on me.

				PERDITA
		Wish Id fuckin cut you up good.

				BOBBY
		You heard from Reggie?

				PERDITA
		Juana called.  Theyre stayin 
		another week.

Bobby stops walking and stares at the photograph on the wall.

				BOBBY
		Stayin a few extra days in the big
		N.O., huh?  This you?

Perdita turns her head and looks, then turns back.

				PERDITA
		Yes.

We see the photo now.  In it are Perdita along with her sister, Juana, 
and her husband, Reggie, whom we recognize as the killers of Johnnie.

				BOBBY
		Dont look like you.

Bobby turns around and leans down and puts his face next to Perditas 
from behind.


				BOBBY
		The cobras waitin to strike, chica.

				PERDITA
		That guy Sailor came around this
		afternoon...  Asked me if there was
		a contract out on im.

				BOBBY
			(laughs out loud)
		No shit?!?!  You know him?

				PERDITA
		Used to.

				BOBBY
		Whatd you say?

				PERDITA
		No, of course.

Bobby takes out a silver dollar and flips it into the air.  It lands 
tails up in his hand.  He pockets it.

				BOBBY
		Thats right...  Could have a bad
		accident, though ... before ... 
		durin ... or after a hold-up...

				PERDITA
		Whats gonna happen when he sees me 
		drivin the car tomorrow?

				BOBBY
		Maybe hell get a little nervous,
		but who gives a shit?

Bobby lowers his hands into the front of Perditas blouse and cups her 
breasts.  She burns the back of his left wrist with her cigarette.  
Bobby jumps back, then grabs Perditas hair and pulls her over the couch 
onto the floor.  Neither of them speak.  She tries to stand, but Bobby 
keeps his right foot on her chest while he blows the back of his wounded 
wrist.  Perdita shoves his leg to one side and rolls away.  She stand up 
and spits at him.

				BOBBY
			(grinning)
		I knew we could be friends again...

141. INT. IGUANA MOTEL - DAY

Lula lays very still on the bed.  Her head is close to the small 
turquoise radio on the bedside table.  She is listening to a piece of 
sad, nostalgic music and as we move in closer to her and the radio - the 
volume increases.

Lula remembers some moments in her life with Sailor: (Music continues 
over)

When he kissed her outside the jail gate.

When he touched her breast the day after he got out of jail.

When they sat behind the Confederate Soldier.

When they danced to Slaughter House.

Suddenly, Lula sees an image in her mind that she does not recognize.  
She sees an abstract image of reflected light with two eyes looking 
through it at her.  The image puzzles her.

(The Music continues over)

		Remember, soon as we get inside, you

Bobby slips the panty hose over his head and adjusts it.  His face looks

Sailor rips open the package and pulls a nylon leg over his head, 
stretching the calf part to fit.

Perdita pulls up in front of the store.  The street is deserted.

Suddenly, an Iguana County DEPUTY SHERIFF cruises up in a patrol car and 
parks it on angle in front of the idling Eldo.  The Deputy gets out of 
his car and walks over to the drivers side of the Eldorado.

				DEPUTY
		Waitin for somebody, Miss?

				PERDITA

The two old guys have their hands in the air and are moving back behind 
the counter.  Bobby is just finishing tying off a bag of money.  Sailor 
is by the front door holding his pistol on the two old guys.  When Bobby 
finishes tying the money bag - he lifts the shotgun and blows a hole 
through the chest of one of the old men.  Sailor goes into shock.

				SAILOR

Sailor turns his pistol on Bobby now.  Bobby spins his shotgun around 
and points it at Sailor.

				BOBBY
		Youre next, fucker.

The second old man is reaching under the counter.

Sailor fires his .32 at Bobby.  There are no live bullets in his pistol.  
It just makes a dry click.  Bobby smiles and is just about to kill 
Sailor when out of the corner of his eye he catches sight of the second 
old man bringing out a big shotgun of his own.  Bobby instinctively 
spins and empties the second barrel of his two-barrel shotgun into the 
old gentleman.  As Bobby is reloading fast, Sailor sprints through the 
front door.  Bobby is right behind him as he flys out the front door.


148A. EXT. RAMOS FEED STORE - DAY

The deputy recovers and comes up on one knee with his revolver clasped 
in both hands.  He fires his first shot into Bobbys thigh and his 
second into Bobbys left hip.  The shock of the initial slug causes 
Bobby to drop the bag.  The impact of the second forces Bobbys right 
hand to twist sideways to that both barrels of the shotgun wedge under 
his chin.  The Ithaca goes off, blowing Bobby backwards through the 
RAMOS on the plate glass window of the feed store.

Sailor hits the ground - losing the Smith as he falls.  He puts his hand 
over his hosieried head and keeps his face in the dirt until the deputy 
orders him to stand up.

her.

				MARIETTA
		Oh baby, I was beginnin to think 
		I was never gonna see you again.

Tears are pouring down Mariettas cheeks.  She holds Lula to her and 
Lula does not resist.  Lula just stares at Santos.

				MARIETTA
		Youre comin home, precious.  Santos

				LULA
		Mama, Sailors in deep trouble here.
		I just cant leave him.

Marietta takes Lula by the shoulders and looks straight at her.  Lulas 
eyes are bloodshot, her hair is greasy and stringy, and her cheeks are 
pale.

				MARIETTA
		Oh, yes, you can.

Santos steps forward.  Lula begins to tremble.

				SANTOS
		Your mamas been real worried bout
		you, honey.  Me too...  Can you
		give your old friend Santos a hug,

Santos arms begin to go around Lula.  Lula lets out a blood-curdling 
scream and shakes like a leaf on a tree.  Santos grabs her hard - in a 
bear hug.  On one shirt cuff we see a cufflink which is turquoise, 
orange, and silver.

			(voice-over)

Dearest Sailor Darling,

The first thing youll want to know is Im keeping the baby.
Mama wasnt for it in the beginning but I think shes looking
forward to it.  Im gonna name it Pace no matter if its a 
boy or a girl.  Pace Ripley sounds good, dont it?  Its
kind of hard to believe that Pace will be six years old 
when you get out.

I feel like Im kind of in prison too, but I know in six
months, itll be over and Ill have a son or daughter to
show for it.  Our child!!

I love you Sailor.  I dont know how much or what it 
means though I miss you an awful bunch sometimes I know
youre thinking about me cause I can feel it.  I miss
you not being around to call me peanut nobody else ever
called me that.

Mama married Santos.  It just about drove me crazy.  My
daddy left a lot of money somehow and theyre spending
it like there is no tomorrow.  Im going to move out as
soon as I can.

Mama and Santos said because of the baby theyre lookin
at the two of us in a different light - whatever that
means.

Johnnie Farragut has plumb disappeared.  No one knows
where.  I miss him, but not near as much as I miss you.

Time dont really fly honey does it?

Love,
your Lula

P.S. I miss dancing...

				SAILOR

Dear Lula,

It is fine with me about the baby as you already know. 
And Pace being your family name and all is just right.
What about a middle name if it is a boy after my 
granddaddy Roscoe?  He would be proud I know though
he is long passed.  Pace Roscoe Ripley does not sound
so bad do you think?

This place is not so pretty as Pee Dee.  Not pretty
at all.  There are boys inside these walls meaner
than Peru you can bet.  There is a Death House.  I
am getting along.  The only thing is not thinking
about the future.

I miss dancing with you, too.  I love you.  It is
hard to end this letter.  If I stop writing youre
gone.  There is not a lot more to say though.
Vava con dios mi amor.

Sailor

Six years later...  Lula stands in the living room holding a glass of 
ice water while talking on the telephone to her mother.  Marietta is 
wearing a giant diamond ring on one hand and the other hand is holding a 
Martini and Rossi sweet vermouth.  Marietta is slumped over in an 
ottoman with wheels and is pushing her drunken self around the 
livingroom as she talks on the phone.

PACE ROSCOE FORTUNE is a shy, polite, innocent six-year old who wears a

				PACE
		Howll we know what he looks like?

Lula makes a wide left turn onto Jeff Davis Highway without signaling, 
causing the driver of a white Bonneville headed across the intersection 
to jam on his brakes in order to avoid a collision.  The Bonneville 
driver sits on his horn and shouts at Lula.

				PACE
		Mama, you almost crashed us.

Lula steadies the steering wheel of her Camaro with her left elbow while 
she strikes a match and lights up a More.  She throws the match out the 
window and takes possession of the wheel with both hands, the cigarette 
is clamped in her teeth.

				LULA
		Dont give me no trouble now, Pace,

Lula puffs furiously several times on her More before she takes it out 
of her mouth and drops it.

				LULA
		Damn it, child!  Now look what you

				PACE
		What I made you do, mama?

Lula feels around on the floor with one hand until she finds the 
cigarette.  Sirens can be heard up ahead.

Sailor smiles.

He stands up and looks down at Pace, who is still holding hands with 
Lula.  Sailor puts out his right hand.

				SAILOR
		You must be my son.

				LULA
		Shake hands with your daddy.

Pace releases Lulas hand and puts his own in Sailors.  Sailor grips it 
gently but firmly, pumps once, then lets go.

				SAILOR
		Pleasure to meet you, Pace.  I read

Sailor looks at Lula.  Her eyes are full of tears and she lets them

				PACE
		Whats wrong, mama?

				SAILOR

		Dont worry, son.  Just stay here.

Sailor gets out and goes over to Lula, who is leaning back against the

		Really, Sail, Ill be okay.

				SAILOR
		Its a mistake, honey.  You two go on.

		Whatre you talkin about?  Thats

				SAILOR
		He aint never known me, Lula, so

		Not seein each other for six years

				LULA
		How can you say that, Sailor?

				SAILOR
		What makes sense, is all.

Sailor goes around to the drivers side, reaches in and pulls the keys 
out of the ignition.  He unlocks the trunk, removes his suitcase, and 
closes the lid.

				LULA
		Dont do this, Sailor, please.

Sailor slips the keys in her shirt pocket and leans his head into the

Sailor stands up and looks at Lula.  Her eye makeup runs in dark streaks 
down her face.

ECU of Lulas eyes.  Her eye makeup runs like black sweat over eyes and 
down her cheeks as in Sailors dream.

				SAILOR
		You been doin fine without me, peanut.

Sailor continues walking down the street.  A GANG OF INSANE KILLER 
TEENAGERS on PCP appear and come towards Sailor.  They circle around 
him, coming in closer for the kill.

				SAILOR
		What do you faggots want?

Thats all it takes.  The gang is on him.  Sailor tries to defend 
himself, but one big punch to his nose sends him down and out.  Blood 
begins to pour from his swelling nose.


162A. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

CU OF SAILORS FACE - a bright light illuminates it.

In the sky above Sailor, a large glowing bubble holding the beautiful 
Good Witch of the North comes floating down above him.

				GOOD WITCH
		Sailor Ripley...

Sailors eyes suddenly see the Good Witch through his closed eyelids.  
His mouth speaks through closed lips.

				SAILOR
		The Good Witch...

				GOOD WITCH
		Sailor...  Lula loves you.

				SAILOR
		But Im a robber and a manslaughterer
		and I havent had any parental 
		guidance.

				GOOD WITCH
		Shes forgiven you of all these things

		But Im wild at heart.

				GOOD WITCH
		If you are truly wild at heart, youll

		away from love...  Dont turn away

The Good Witch disappears.


162. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Sailor opens his eyes and drags himself and his giant swollen nose up on 
his feet.  The gang still stands around him.

				GANG MEMBER
		You had enough, asshole?

		Yes, I have...  And I wanna apologize

Sailor runs up the street, holding his nose and SCREAMING LULAS NAME.

He rounds a corner and spots her in the middle of a sea of cars.

He starts running towards her - leaping from one car to another until he 
jumps on the hood of Lulas car.

She sees him.

				SAILOR
		LULA!!!!

				LULA
		SAILOR!!!!

Lula wriggles out of the car and flys into his arms.  Behind them is a 
giant golden sunset.  As they embrace - the sound of the horns goes 
away.  Lulas gaze goes to a reflection of golden light on a windshield.  
It is the same abstract scene she saw before in her room in Big Tuna, 
but now she knows what it is.  It is Paces happy, smiling eyes looking 
up at the two of them in love.

Sailor, with a giant blue nose, looks into Lulas eyes and sings Love 
Me Tender. 

The people in their cars, and the people on the street look on with a 
feeling of love and happiness in their hearts.

3. EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

With a whine from hell, the front tire of the motorcycle hits a speed 
bump.

The motorcycle becomes airborne and on the way up slices itself in half 
as it scrapes along the full length of a Datsun Kingcab.

In the air, the rider and motorcycle twist violently as they fly by.

The motorcycle bounces off a black 66 Chevrolet and makes a sound like 
the end of the world.

The rider hits the same Chevy a moment later.  Like a broken ragdoll 
shot from a canon, the man punches through the back window blowing glass 
for a block.  He stops somewhere under the front seat and a bubble of 
blood forms out his nose.

The motorcycle continues on sliding and spinning with an ear-piercing 
howl for one entire city block.

4. EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - VACANT LOT - DAY

Two rabid dogs fight ferociously in a vacant lot - ripping each others 
flesh.  An OLD COUPLE, both with walkers, inch painfully along nearby.

				OLD WOMAN
		Oh my God! ... Why they doin that?

				OLD MAN
		Who the hell knows.  What you have
		in your mouth?

The old woman begins to turn away, covering her mouth with her hand.

				OLD MAN 
		Spit it out!!! ... Pull your teeth
		out ... doctor said.  What you 
		tryin to do?  SPIT IT OUT!!!

The Old Man grabs the Old Woman by the neck and squeezes.  Out comes a 
tangled and sticky ball of hard fruit candies.

5. WASP NEST

A thousand wasps hover threateningly in the air around the nest.  A 
SMALL GROUP OF HARDENED CRIMINAL NINE-YEAR OLDS sporting hideous grins, 
bat the nest violently to and fro with sticks.  One kid busies himself 
shooting a large can of Black Flag garden spray into a crack in the 
nest.  Another stomps half-dead wasps up and down the sidewalk.  All the 
kids are making animal noises of one sort or the other.

A beat-up, red 64 Ford Falcon station wagon filled with insane

Lula and her friend, BEANY THORN, sit at a table drinking rum Coca-Colas 
while watching and listening to a white blues band called THE BLEACH

into Robert Johnsons Me and the Devil and Beany lets out a snort.

				BEANY
		I can dig this music...  But not

				LULA
		Why?...  Hes right in the groove.

				BEANY
		Hes so ugly.  Guys with beards and

				BEANY
		Yeah, well, if he says that all that

Lula and Beany laugh and swallow some of their drinks.

				BEANY
		So, Sailors gettin out soon, and
		youre gonna see him?

Lula nods and crushes an ice cube with her back teeth and chews it.

				LULA
		Meetin him at the gate.  That phone
		call this afternoon was the signal.
		My deranged mamas hid the keys to
		my car.  But of course, I know

				BEANY
		I didnt hate me so much, Id feel

		Cant all husbands be perfect, and

They kiss tenderly and then Sailor walks around the car to get in while 
Lula opens up a suitcase and gets out his snakeskin jacket.

Sailor and Lula lay on the bed in the Cape Fear Hotel listening to the

				LULA
		Did you ever think somethin like

		comin flyin in?...  Did you ever
		think somethin and then later think
		youve said it out loud to someone?

				SAILOR
		I really did miss your mind while I
		was out at Pee Dee, honey.  The
		rest of you, too, of course.  But 
		the way your head works is Gods own
		private mystery.  What was it you
		was thinkin?

				LULA
		Well, I was thinkin about smokin 
		actually...  My mama smokes Marlboros
		now, used to be she smoked Kools?
		I stole em from her beginnin in
		about sixth grade.  When I got old
		enough to buy my own, I bought those.
		Now Ive just about settled on Mores,
		as you probably noticed?  Theyre longer.


				SAILOR
		I guess I started smokin when I was
		about six...  My mama was already
		dead from lung cancer...

				LULA
		What brandd she smoke?

				SAILOR
		Camels, same as me...  Guess both
		my mama and my daddy died of smoke
		or alcohol related illness.

				LULA
		Gee, Sailor.  Im sorry, honey.  I 
		never would have guessed it.

				SAILOR
		Its okay.  I hardly used to see 
		them anyway.  I didnt have much 
		parental guiding.  The public defender
		kept sayin that at my parole hearin.
		He was a good ol boy, stood by me...
		Even brought me some cartons of 
		cigarettes from time to time.

				LULA
		Id stand by you, Sailor ... through
		anything.

				SAILOR
		Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after
		I planted Bob Ray Lemon.  A man cant
		ask for more than that.

Lula pulls Sailor over to her and kisses him soft on the mouth.

				LULA
		You move me, Sailor, you really do.
		You mark me the deepest.

Sailor pulls down the sheet, exposing Lulas breasts.

				SAILOR
		Youre perfect for me, too.

				LULA
		You remind me of my daddy, you know?
		Mama told me he liked skinny women
		whose breasts were just a bit too
		big for their bodies.  He had a long
		nose, too, like theirs.  Did I ever
		tell you how he died?

				SAILOR
		In a fire, as I recall.

				LULA
		Started he couldnt remember things?
		Got real violent?  Mama kept tellin
		me it was on account of lead poisoning
		from cleanin the old paint off our
		house without usin a mask...  But
		I dont know.  Seems like his brain
		just fell apart in pieces.

Sailor takes the cigarette out of Lulas hand and puts it into the

		I knew this would happen.  Soon as

		Hes just got some kind of influence

				JOHNNIE
		He served his time for what he did.
		Another thing...  If Lula went with

		that is - there aint much can be
		done about it.

				MARIETTA
		Dont talk down to me, Johnnie 
		Farragut.  I know what volition means,
		and thats why I want Sailor Ripley
		off the planet!  Hes pure slime and 
		its leakin all over my baby.  
		Maybe you could push him into makin
		some kinda move and then kill him
		dead.  Youd only be defendin 
		yourself, and with his record,

Johnnie pours himself another tumblerful of Walker Black Label.

				JOHNNIE
		Ill locate Lula, Marietta, and if
		shes with the Ripley boy, Ill
		give him a talkin to and try to
		convince her to come back with me.
		Thats about all I can do.

He takes a long swallow from the tumbler.  Marietta begins to cry.  She 
blubbers for a few seconds, and then stops as abruptly as shed started.  
Her grey eyes glaze over.

				MARIETTA
		Ill hire a hit man if you dont want

				JOHNNIE
		Now, Marietta, I am goin to help you.
		And dont be gettin carried away.
		You dont want to be bringin Santos

				MARIETTA
		Youre just jealous of Santos cause

				JOHNNIE
		Darlin, you aint seein Santos

				MARIETTA
		Oh, Johnnie Farragut...  Dont you

				JOHNNIE
		Sorry, sweetheart.  Bein in love

				MARIETTA
		Well stop worryin about me and

				JOHNNIE
		Sailor aint a murderer.  You got to
		get off that kick.  And fars I can 
		tell, Sailor was entire clean prior

		he was protectin her.  You oughta

		Ray Lemon they say was comin after

Lula is standing in the bathroom of their room at the Hotel fooling with 
her hair in front of the mirror.  Sailor can see her through the doorway 
from where he lays on the bed.

				LULA
		Sailor, you are somethin else, 
		honey...  When I was fifteen, Mama
		told me that pretty soon Id be
		startin to think about sex, and
		I should talk to her before I did
		anything about it.

				SAILOR
		But honey, I thought you told me
		your Uncle Pooch raped you when
		you was thirteen.

				LULA
		Thats true.  Uncle Pooch wasnt
		really an uncle.  He was a business
		partner of my daddys?  And my mama
		never knew nothin about me and 
		him - thats for damn sure.  His real
		name was somethin kind of European,
		like Pucinski.  But everyone just
		called him Pooch.  He came around the
		house sometimes when Daddy was away.
		I always figured he was sweet on 
		mama, so when he cornered me one 
		afternoon, I was surprised moren
		a little.

				SAILOR
		Howd it happen, peanut?  He just
		pull out the old toad and let it
		croak?

Lula brushes away her bangs and frowns.  She takes a cigarette from the 
pack on the sink and lights it, then lets it dangle from her lips while 
she teases her hair.

				LULA
		Youre terrible crude sometimes, 
		Sailor, you know?

				SAILOR
		I cant hardly understand you when
		you talk with one of them Mores in
		your mouth.

Lula takes a long, slow drag on her More and sets it down on the edge of 
the sink.

				LULA
		I said you can be too crude sometimes?
		I dont think I care for it.

				SAILOR
		Sorry, sugar.  Go on and tell me how

		Well, sure.  But he was super-gentle,
		you know?  I mean, he raped me and
		all, but I guess theres all 
		different kinds of rapes.  I didnt
		exactly want him to do it but I 
		suppose once it started, it didnt
		seem all that terrible.  It was over 
		pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch
		just stood there and pulled up his
		trousers and left me there.  I 
		stayed in bed till I heard him drive
		off.  Then I just went back into
		the kitchen and finished makin my
		sandwich.

				SAILOR
		And you never told nobody about it?

				LULA
		Just you.  Uncle Pooch never acted

		Sailor, that ozone layer is

Lula strikes a match and lights another cigarette.

				SAILOR

		That aint never will happen, honey.
		Least not in our lifetime.

Somewhere in the hotel a woman laughs.  It is a kind of wild, crazy 
laugh, and for the few seconds it lasts, Lulas face goes pale.

				SAILOR
		You okay, honey?

				LULA
		That womans laugh creeps me out.
		I heard somethin like that...

		Take care of him?

		Yes.

				SANTOS
		What does take care of him mean?...
		Do you want me to give him food or
		some clothing?

				MARIETTA
		Whats with you?...  You know what
		take care of him means.  I dont 
		call Santos except for one big reason.

				SANTOS
		Big is the key word, and Im telling

				MARIETTA
		I want you to get rid of Sailor.

				SANTOS
		Get rid of him?

				MARIETTA
		Yes...  Get rid of him.

				SANTOS
		How would I do that?  Send him on a

				MARIETTA
		Santos, why in hell do you insist on

				SANTOS
		Just tell me what you want.

		Yes.

				SANTOS
		But where in the head?...  Not the

		Yes.

				MARIETTA
		See!  I knew you had it all under

		Maybe I did...  Try New Orleans first...

36. INT. THE HURRICANE - A SPEED METAL CLUB - NIGHT

We see the sign which has all the letters tipped way over to the right - 
as if in a hurricane.  Two leaning palm trees border the sign.

One hundred decibels of speed metal.  We see the name Powermad on the 
bass drum.

The BAND segues into Slaughter House and its a hot one.  Sailor grabs 
Lula and they start dancing like two jacked-up spastics in an electrical 
storm.  a few PUNKS actually stop dancing to watch Sailor and Lula.  
They thought theyd seen everything.

CU of Lula and Sailor - theyre in love and dancing hot.  An IDIOT PUNK 
moves close to Lula and rubs up against her as he dances by.  Sailor 
turns to the lead guitar player and signals him to stop the music 
immediately.  Suddenly everything is deathly quiet.  Sailor gives the 
man a fully extended Reno point...

				SAILOR
		Are you going to provide me with an 
		opportunity to prove my love to my
		girl?  Or are you gonna save 
		youself some trouble and step up 
		like a gentleman and apologize to her?

				IDIOT PUNK
		Dont fuck with me, man.  You look 
		like a clown in that stupid jacket.

				SAILOR
		This is a snakeskin jacket, and for
		me its a symbol of my individuality
		and my belief in personal freedom.

				IDIOT PUNK
		...Asshole.

				SAILOR
		(as he moves toward the Idiot Punk)
		Come here.

				LULA
		Sailor, honey...

The Idiot Punk tries to hit Sailor, but Sailor slaps him so hard his 
knees almost bend backwards.  The Idiot Punk goes down - fighting back 
tears and holding his cheek.

				SAILOR
		     (helping him up)
		Im sorry to do this to ya here 
		in front of a crowd, but I want ya
		to stand up and make a nice apology
		to my girl.

				IDIOT PUNK
			(to Lula)
		Im sorry.

				LULA
		Hell, you just rubbed up against 
		the wrong girl is all.

				SAILOR
		Thats good...  Now go get yourself
		a beer.

		You fellas have alotta the same power
		Elvis had...  Yall know this one?...

Sailor starts to sing an Elvis Presley song, Love Me.  As the band 
joins in with a perfect back-up - Sailor sings to Lula.  The Speed Metal 
crowd is mesmerized.

Sailor turns around from his sprawled on the bed position watching The

				SAILOR

Lula slides her head up and kisses Sailor on the cheek.

				LULA
		Im sorry, sweetie.  I forget some

				LULA
		Oh, you know exactly what I mean,

				SAILOR
		At Pee Dee, all you think about is

		And what youll do and what youll
		think about when youre on the

				LULA
		I just think about things as they

She takes out a cigarette the length and width of a Dixon Ticonderoga

				SAILOR
		Got you a pack of Mores again, huh?

				LULA
		Yeah, its a real problem for me, 
		Sailor, you know?  When I went in

		Biloxi?  I saw em by the register
		and the girl throw em in.  Im
		not big on resistin.  So what about
		a leech?

				SAILOR
		Heard on the radio how doctors is

		used em?

				LULA
			(shuddering)
		I got one on me at Lake Lanier.  
		Lifeguard poured salt on it and it

Sailor laughs.

				SAILOR
		Yeah, well listen to this...  Radio

74. INT. MINI-MART - DAY

A tall OLD BLACK MAN about seventy years old, wearing a torn green 
Tulane tee-shirt and a dirty orange Saints baseball cap, is filing items 
on the counter by the cash register.  In the pile are four ready-made, 
plastic-wrapped sandwiches, two tuna salad and two cotto salami; six 
Twinkies; a package of Chips Ahoy chocolate chip cookies; four Slice 
colas; two Barqs root beers; and a large package of fried pork rinds, 
extra salted.

				BLACK MAN
		    (to Sailor and another guy 
		    also waiting to pay for gas)
		Sorry, gentlemen.  Im most finished
		on my shoppin here.

				ERV
		This be it?

				BLACK MAN
		Yall take American Express?

				ERV
		Yessir.

				BLACK MAN
		Then lemme throw in a couple more
		things.

Sailor and the man in line behind him watch as the black man gathers up 
several more packages of Twinkies along with a few cupcakes and half a 
dozen cans of Pretty Kitty cat food, three liver and three chicken 
dinner portions, and tosses them on his pile.

				BLACK MAN
		   (to Sailor, smiling - showing 
		    no visible upper teeth)
		Pussycats gotta eat, too.

He hands an American Express card to the clerk, ERV, who runs it through 
the verifier.  The card checks out okay and the old guy prepares a 
charge slip, has the man sign it, and bags the purchases.

				BLACK MAN
			(to Erv)
		Id just soon have a paper bag 
		rather than a plastic one, if its
		same to you.

				ERV
		  (shoving the plastic bag he
		   filled towards the black man)
		We dont have no paper bags.

A telephone begins to ring and everyone looks around.  The Black Man 
reaches in his jacket pocket and pulls out a portable phone and punches 
send.

				BLACK MAN
			(into phone)
		Hello...  Yeah, mama, Im on my 
		way...
			(to Sailor and other guy
		   as he picks up his bag
			and heads out)
		Thanks for waitin, gentlemen.

Everyone is silent as they watch the old Black Man hobble out.

				SAILOR
			(to Erv)
		All I wants ten bucks regular.
		Oh yeah, and a Mounds bar.

Erv takes one off the candy and gum rack next to the register and lays 
it on the counter.  Sailor gives him a twenty dollar bill.

				SAILOR
		I aint got my American Express card
		with me, so I gotta use cash.  Hope
		thats okay.

Sailor smiles, but the clerk keeps a poker face and just gives him his 
change.  The guy in line behind Sailor shakes his head and grins.


75. EXT. MINI MART/THUNDERBIRD - DAY

Sailor goes back to the car.

				LULA
		That took long enough.  You forget
		my Mounds?

Sailor tosses her the candy bar.

				SAILOR
		I really do think the country done
		changed just a little while I was
		away, peanut.

Lula sinks her small white teeth into the chocolate-covered coconut.

				LULA
			(as she chews)
		You got to keep an eye on it.  Thats

Sailor starts pumping gas.

man, DROP SHADOW approach with their trays of food.

				REGGIE
		Do you mind if we share this table?
		...  The others, they are occupied.

Johnnie looks around - sees that there are quite a few empty tables - he 
looks the men over quickly.

				JOHNNIE
			(cautiously)
		Alright...  By all means.  Make 
		yourselves at home.

				DROP SHADOW
			(as he sits down)
		Muchas gracias.

				REGGIE
		My name is Reginald San Pedro Sula.
		But please do call me Reggie.  This
		is my friend, who we call Drop
		Shadow.  He is always with me.

Johnnie wipes off his right hand on his napkin and shakes.

				JOHNNIE
		Johnnie Farragut.  Pleased to meet ya.

Reggie and Drop Shadow begin eating ferociously, finishing half of their 
meal before saying anything more.

				REGGIE
		You are from New Orleans, Senor 
		Farragut?

				JOHNNIE
		Johnnie, please.  Nope.  Charlotte,
		North Carolina.  Here on business.

Reggie smiles broadly, revealing numerous tall, gold teeth.

				DROP SHADOW
		Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras.

				REGGIE
		Do you know Honduras, Johnny?

				JOHNNIE
		Only that its supposed to be a 
		pretty poor sight since the hurricane
		came through last year.

				REGGIE
		Yes, thats so.  But there is not 
		much to destroy.

				DROP SHADOW
		No big buildings like in New Orleans.

				JOHNNIE
		Whattaya do there?

				REGGIE
			(laughs)
		Oh, many things...

				DROP SHADOW
		Mr. San Pedro Sulas got an appliance
		shop.

				REGGIE
		But I am also with the government.

Johnnie takes a bite of his oyster sandwich.

				JOHNNIE
		In what capacity?

				REGGIE
		In many capacities.

				DROP SHADOW
		Mr. San Pedro Sula is with the 
		Secret Service.

Reggie reaches into his back pocket and takes out his wallet.  He hands 
a card to Johnnie.

				JOHNNIE
			(reading aloud)
		General Osvaldo Tamarindo y Ramirez.
		Telefono 666.

				REGGIE
		He is my sponsor.  The General is
		the head of the secret police of
		Honduras.

				DROP SHADOW
		Mr. San Pedro Sula is one of his
		operatives.

Johnnie hands the card back to Reggie and Reggie gives him a small piece 
of paper, folded once.  Johnnie unfolds it.  The printing is in Spanish.

				REGGIE
		That is my permiso.

				DROP SHADOW
		Mr. San Pedro Sulas permit to kill.

				REGGIE
		Only if necessary, of course, and
		only in my own country.
			(laughs)

				JOHNNIE
		Of course.

Johnnie refolds the piece of paper and hands it over to Reggie.

				DROP SHADOW
		Mr. San Pedro Sulas authorized to
		carry a .45.

				REGGIE
		United States Marine issue, before
		they made the unfortunate switch to
		the less dependable nine millimeters.
		I have it here, in my briefcase.

Reggie holds up his stainless steel briefcase and then replaces it on 
the floor beneath his chair.

				JOHNNIE
		Why are you in New Orleans?  If you 
		dont mind my askin.

				REGGIE
		Certainly not.  We are here only
		briefly, in fact, until this evening,
		when we fly to Austin, Texas to visit
		a friend of mine who is an agent for
		the CIA.

				DROP SHADOW
		He wants to take Mr. San Pedro Sula
		and me bass fishing.

				REGGIE
		We are in the same businesses and
		also we are fishermen.

Johnnie swallows the last of his beer and stands up to leave.

				JOHNNIE
			(extending his hand)
		Its been a real pleasure.  I wish
		you both buena suerte wherever you go.

Reggie and Drop Shadow stand up.  They shake Johnnies hand.

				REGGIE
		The same to you.  If you are in 
		Honduras, come to the Bay Islands and
		visit us.  The Hondurans are great
		friends of the American people.  But
		I have a joke for you before I go.
		If a liberal, a socialist, and a 
		communist all jumped off the roof of
		the Empire State Building at the 
		same time, which one of them would
		hit the ground first?

				JOHNNIE
		I couldnt say, which one?

Reggie turns to Drop Shadow and lets him have the punch line.

				GEORGE
		Was in all the papers three years ago.
		Im seventy-six, was only seventy-
		three then.  Had a business in
		Buffalo, New York, called Rats With
		Wings.  Killed pigeons for anyone
		who wanted em killed.

				LULA
		Why were you killin pigeons, Mr.
		Kovich?  Were you in the extermination
		business?

				GEORGE
		No, maam.  I was a housepainter, 
		in the union forty-one years.  Im
		retired now, livin with my sister, 
		Ida.  Ida moved down here twenty-five
		years ago, married an oil man named
		Smoltz, Ed Smoltz.  Hes dead now,
		so its just me and Ida.  I sold my
		house and moved down after the city
		of Buffalo put me out of business.
		Hell, RWW was doin them a service,
		and they charged me with endangerin

				SAILOR
		If your neighbors didnt mind,

				GEORGE
		Woman drivin down the street spotted

		and arrested me.  Thought I was a
		sniper!  Boys at the VFW loved that
		one.  Cops didnt understand about
		the pigeons, the damage they do to
		personal property.  I used to complain
		to the city but they never lifted
		a finger.  I was gonna put out poison,
		but I was afraid somebodys cat 
		would eat it.  Hell, I had six cats
		myself.  So I used the .22 because
		it didnt make much noise and the
		ammo was cheap.

				SAILOR
		What happened on the charges?

				GEORGE
		Guilty on a reduced charge.  Hundred
		dollar fine and ordered to desist.
		Pigeons carry diseases and muss up

Kovich stands up and puts some money on the counter.

				GEORGE
		Its a serious situation.  Not like

				LULA
		He was sittin there havin a beignet
		at the Cafe Du Monde.  Do you think
		he saw us?

				SAILOR
		Lula, darlin...  Makes no difference

We watch the car disappear up the street.  Slowly the camera pans and 
Reggie and Drop Shadow come walking happily along the sidewalk - 
whistling.

94. INT. THUNDERBIRD

Lula and Sailor are motoring along.

				SAILOR
		Sweetheart, keep your panties up.
		Were in Jimmy Swaggart country.

Sailor and Lula both laugh.  Up ahead, Sailor spots a hitchhiker.  He 
slows to pick him up.

				LULA
		Sure you wanna do this?  Might be 
		a way they could track us.

				SAILOR
		Hes just a regular guyt needs help,
		honey.  Look at him.

The HITCHHIKER is a man about thirty with a pack on his back, and he is 
carrying a large, covered cardboard box.  He is filthy, with an uneven 
smile that exposes his jagged yellow teeth.  Lula opens the door for 
him, and after he loads his stuff, Sailor takes off down the highway.

				ROACH
		Thanks a lot.  I been standin out
		there off and on for two hours, ha-ha!
		Since noon about, ha-ha!  Cops catch
		ya hitchin on a Interstate around here
		they throw ya on a county road crew
		for a week, less you can pay the
		ticket, ha-ha!  Which I aint got, ha-ha!

				SAILOR
		My names Sailor, and this heres
		Lula.  Whats yours?

				ROACH
		Marvin DeLoach.  But everbody calls
		me Roach, ha-ha!  Roach DeLoach, ha-ha!

				LULA
		You always make that strange little
		funny laugh when you talk?

				ROACH
		Aint laughin, ha-ha!

				SAILOR
		What you got in the box?

				ROACH
		My dogs, ha-ha!

Roach slides the top off and tilts the box slightly toward the front.  
Inside are six small husky pups that are not more than two weeks old.

				ROACH
		Im headed to Alaska, ha-ha!  These
		dogs is gonna be my sled team, ha-ha!

				LULA
			(to Sailor)
		This guys crazy.

				SAILOR
		Where you from, Roach?

				ROACH
		If you mean where I was born, it was
		Belzoni, Missippi, ha-ha!  But I
		been brought up in Baton Rouge.

				LULA
		Why you goin to Alaska?  And whered
		you get them puppies?  They look sick.

Roach stares down into the box at the baby huskies and strokes each of 
them twice with a religiously unwashed hand.  The dogs whimper and lick 
his dirty fingers.

				ROACH
		I saw this movie on TV, ha-ha!  The
		Call of the Wild.  I aint never
		seen snow, ha-ha!  I got these dogs
		at the pound.  Nobody wanted em, 
		ha-ha!  Everbody here got theirself
		pit bulls or some kinda hounds.  Im
		gonna feed these boys good so theyll
		be big and powerful and they can pull
		me real fast through the snow, ha-ha!

Roach pulls a piece of raw cows liver out of one of his pockets of his 
field jacket and begins ripping little bits off it and feeding them to 
the dogs.

				LULA
		  (screeches as she sees this)
		Sailor!  Stop!  Stop the car now!

Sailor pulls off the road onto the shoulder of the highway and stops.  
Lula opens her door and jumps out.

				LULA
		Im sorry, but I cant take this.  
		Roach, or whatever your name is, you
		come out of there with them dogs
		this instant!

Roach sticks the liver back in his pocket and pulls his pack and the box 
of tiny canines after him.  Once he and his belongings are deposited on 
the roadside, Lula hops back in the car and slams the door.

				LULA
		Im truly sorry?  Im truly sorry, 
		Roach.  But aint gonna make it to
		Alaska?  Least not any part of the 
		way with us.  Youd best find a 
		party to take care of those dogs 
		proper, before they all die?  And, 
		if you dont mind my sayin so?  You
		could most certainly use some serious
		lookin after yourself, startin with
		a bath!

Lula takes a pair of sunglasses off the dashboard and puts them on.

				LULA
		Drive.

Sailor takes off.

				SAILOR
		You dont feel you was a little hard
		on the guy, honey?

				LULA
		I know youre thinkin that I got
		moren some of my mama in me?  Well,
		I couldnt help it.  Sailor, I really
		couldnt.  Im sorry for that guy,
		but when he pulled that drippin hunk
		of awful-smellin meat out of his
		pocket?  I near barfed.  And them 
		poor diseased puppies!

				SAILOR
			(laughs)
		Just part of life on the road, peanut.

		Do me a favor, Sailor?  Dont pick up
		no more hitchers, okay?

		You better get a move on, Johnnie,

We see Reggie and Drop Shadow enter the bar.  Reggies unsmiling eyes 
drift across the room until they see Johnnie in the booth.  He stares 
coldly and waits.  Drop Shadow adjusts his socks.

				JOHNNIE
		Really, Marietta, you got more

		I will, Marietta.  Goodbye now.

Johnnie hangs up the phone and exits the booth.  As he crosses the 
bar...

				REGGIE
			(shouting)
		Hola!  Senor Farragut!  We meet again.  

Johnnie goes over to Reggie and Drop Shadow and shakes hands.

				JOHNNIE
		I thought you two were in Austin, 
		Texas.  Or Takes-us, as they say in
		these parts.

				DROP SHADOW
		We were.  Now Mr. San Pedro Sula and
		I are on our way back to Utila, in
		the morning.

				REGGIE
		Would you like to enjoy a martini 
		with us?

				JOHNNIE
		Why not?  How was the fishin?

				REGGIE
		I think they are too serious, these
		American fishermen.  In Honduras, we
		are not so concerned with the method.

Reggie orders martinis for the three of them.

				JOHNNIE
		So, its back to the islands.

				DROP SHADOW
		Yes.  Mr. San Pedro Sula spoke 
		yesterday to his son, Archibald Leach
		San Pedro Sula, who is named after
		Cary Grant, and he told them there
		was a shooting.

				REGGIE
		Teddy Roosevelt, one of the local
		shrimp boat captains is in jail now.
		These people are friends of mine, so
		I must return and find out what 
		happened.

				JOHNNIE
		This island of yours sounds like a 
		kind of unpredictable place.  

				REGGIE
			(laughs)
		It has its moments of uncertainty.

				DROP SHADOW
		But how are you finding New Orleans,
		Senor Farragut?

				JOHNNIE
		Call me Johnnie...  N.O. has always
		been a good town to sit around in.


				REGGIE
		I can tell you are an intelligent
		man, Johnnie.  One difference between
		your country and mine is that in the
		islands, it does not pay to reveal
		ones intelligence...  Others may use
		what they perceive against us...

Reggie raises his glass to Johnnies.

				REGGIE
		Hasta siempre.

				JOHNNIE
		Hasta siempre.

				REGGIE
		Do you know how it came about that
		copper wire was invented in Scotland?

				JOHNNIE
		Hows that?

Johnnie finishes off his martini.

				JOHNNIE
		I gotta admit, you guys are

99. INT. CLUB ZANZIBAR - NIGHT

When they walk in, the BAND is playing a slow blues and THREE OR FOUR 
COUPLES are swaying on the dance floor.  There are a dozen tables and a 
long bar in the room which is done up in a strange dark azquatic motif.  
Eight of the tables are occupied and SIX OR SEVEN MEN stand at the bar.  
Everyone in the place is black except for one WHITE WOMAN who is sitting 
alone at a table smoking a cigarette and drinking Pearl straight from 
the bottle.  The atmosphere is not friendly, but Lula takes Sailor by 
the arm.

				LULA
		Come on.

They step up to the bar and order two Lone Star beers.  The BARTENDER, a 
tall, heavyset man slowly forms his hand into the bird.  He holds his 
hand that way while he speaks...

BARTENDER ZANZIBAR
		This is a friendly place, son.  You 
		folks just relax and have a nice time.

				LULA
		   (bound and determined not 
		    to be intimidated)
		You got yourself a deal.

				BARTENDER
			(to Sailor)
		Thats a real jacket...  By that,
		I mean a real stupid jacket.

				SAILOR
		This is a snakeskin jacket, and for
		me it represents a symbol of my 
		individuality and my belief in
		personal freedom.

				BARTENDER
		Fuckin honky cracker mumbo jumbo.


The bartender moves on down the bar.  Lula and Sailor take a small table 
near the door.

				LULA
		Ill be damned if Im leavin.  That
		band is too good?

				SAILOR
		Uh huh.

				LULA
		You notice that woman when we come

				SAILOR
		Yeah.

				LULA
		Well, she aint talked to nobody

		I could tell.  What you make of that?

				SAILOR
		Honey, we bein strangers here and 
		all, this is the kinda place we dont
		want to make nothin of nothin.

				LULA
		You think shes pretty?

Sailor looks at the woman.  She lights a new cigarette off a butt, then 
squashes the butt in the ashtray.  She is thirty years old, maybe more.  
Shoulder-length, bleached blonde hair, black at the roots.  Clear skin, 
green eyes.  Long, straight nose with a small bump on it.  She is 
wearing a low-cut lavender dress that would have emphasized her breasts 
had she not been so flat-chested.  Slender.

				SAILOR
		I tend to like em with a little 
		more meat on the bones.  Face aint
		bad, though.

Lula gets quiet and sucks on her beer bottle.

				SAILOR
		Whats wrong, sweetheart?  Somethin
		botherin you?

				LULA
		Mama.  I been thinkin about her.
		Shes probly worried to death by now.

				SAILOR
		Moren likely.

BARTENDER ZANZIBAR
		Cant you read?

Sailor stands and leans against the hood of the car until Lula gets up

		Sailor and Lula are headed west, and

He hangs up the phone.

Johnnie enters as Marietta hangs up the phone - covering her fear.

		Who was that?...  Who knows your here?

114. INT. MR. REINDEERS PRIVATE DINING ROOM - NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT

Upstairs in a private dining room, Mr. Reindeer is dining with TWELVE 
GUESTS in formal evening attire.  Behind him, a JAZZ TRIO and a 
STRIPTEASE ARTIST are hard at work.  Mr. Reindeer smiles and leans over 
very close to a beautiful WOMAN sitting to his left.

				MR. REINDEER
		Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet, 
		eating her curds and whey...  Along
		came a spider and sat down beside her,
		and extended his hand out to play.

With this, he reaches under the table between her legs.  She turns red 
and Mr. Reindeer laughs and lights a cigarette.

				MR. REINDEER
		Oh dear...  Another Miss Dull Cunt.

Reggie and Drop Shadow enter through a door on the other side of the 
room.  Reggie catches Mr. Reindeers eye and smiles.  Reggie reaches in 
his pocket and takes out a silver dollar - flips it in the air - catches 
it - and puts it back in his pocket.  Mr. Reindeer smiles and waves him 
over to the table.  He whispers something in Reggies ear - then gives 
him an envelope.

				MR. REINDEER
		When I gave you the silver dollar I
		forgot to give you the contents of
		this envelope.  They are to be 
		returned.  Show it just before the deed...

Reggie pockets the envelope - joins Drop Shadow - and as they are 
leaving the dining room, they join a woman, JUANA, who looks half-
Oriental, half-Cajun.  She wears a strange, short, yellowish-bleached 
blonde wig.

								CUT TO:

115. INT. GALATOIRES RESTAURANT - NIGHT

They go downstairs together.  At the bottom of the stairs, Reggie and 
Drop Shadow catch sight of Johnnie who is sitting in the back of the 
restaurant having dinner with Marietta.  When Johnnie sees the two of 
them he waves, but at the same time gets a chill up his spine.

				MARIETTA
		What is it, Johnnie?

				JOHNNIE
		Just some guys I met here...  I 
		keep seein em...
			(looks back at Marietta)
		Now tell me...

Marietta continues to stare at Reggie, Drop Shadow, and Juana before 
turning back to Johnnie.  She also feels the fear.

				MARIETTA
		Johnnie, I cant tell you, honey.  Is
		there anyway we can get on the road
		tonight?  Weve got to find them kids.

				JOHNNIE
		Somethin was upsettin you bad last
		night, and you wanted to tell me
		and I figured you wanted to tell me
		sos I could help...

				MARIETTA
		I did, honey, but that was last 
		night...  Lets just find those two
		kids before its too late.

				JOHNNIE
		Honey, I have to ask you this...
		Is Santos involved in any of this?

				MARIETTA
		Hell no, baby...  I wouldnta done
		that without tellin you.

				JOHNNIE
		That bastard Pucinski...

				MARIETTA
		Who?...  Uncle Pooch?...

				JOHNNIE
		Yeah...  The one that introduced 
		Santos to you and Clyde.

				MARIETTA
		Johnnie...  Thats the past...  We
		gotta get on to our future, sugar!

				JOHNNIE
			(smiles)
		All I have to do is grab my suitcase,
		and Im ready.  Youre lucky cause
		I happen to love night drivin.

				MARIETTA
		Lets head for Texas and see if we

		Ill pack my things and meet you

Johnnie smiles and heads up to his room.  He opens the door and steps 
inside.  WHAM!!  Johnnie is knocked in the head with a heavy metal pipe 
and he goes down hard.  A large dark figure grabs on to him and pulls 
him to an open window and lowers him into the back of a pick-up.  The
dark figure follows out the window.

DISSOLVE TO:


117. INT. MAISON VIOLETTE - LOBBY - NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT

Marietta is sitting in the lobby trying to hold herself together - half-
sobbing.  The MANAGER approaches and sits next to her.

				MANAGER
		Im afraid his car is gone, Mrs.
		Fortune.

				MARIETTA
		I dont understand this...  I dont
		understand this one bit.  He was 
		supposed to meet me right her in 
		this lobby.  Somethin bad has 
		happened - I jus know it.

				MANAGER
		Perhaps we should call a local law
		enforcement officer.

				MARIETTA
		HELL NO!!!  Thats the last thing 
		we need...  A buncha cops runnin
		around.

The front desk clerk steps from behind his desk and hurries into the 
lobby.

				DESK CLERK
		Im sorry...  But I have overlooked
		this.  Im truly sorry, maam.

He hands Marietta a note inside an envelope which she opens and reads 
immediately.  We see the note.  

NOTE
Gone fishing with a friend - maybe
buffalo hunting.  Johnnie.


				MARIETTA
		Oh God!  What does that mean?

				MANAGER
		Im sure I wouldnt know, maam ...
		and buffalo hunting too ... hmmmmm?

				MARIETTA
		And jus when my babys out on some
		Texas road with a killer.

The front door of the hotel opens and in walks Santos.  He seems to know 
exactly where Marietta is and steps to the door of the sitting room off 
the lobby.  He stands in the doorway and smiles at Marietta.

				MARIETTA
			(horrified whisper)
		Santos...  Wheres J-J-Johnnie?

				SANTOS
		Shhhhhh...
			(to the manager and desk clerk)
		Thank you, gentlemen...  Ill look
		after her now...

The Manager and Desk Clerk bow to Marietta and Santos and go back 
through the lobby.  Santos walks over to Marietta.  Marietta stands.

				MARIETTA
		Santos...  Whats happenin here?

				SANTOS
		Hey...  Stop the nervous cry-baby
		routine...  Youre my girl now...
		Santos is gonna wipe away those tears

								CUT TO:

119. INT. SMALL HUT - DESERTED BAYOU - NIGHT

Johnnie is tied to a small wooden straight-backed chair.  His mouth is 
gagged and taped shut.  His hair is caked with dry blood and one fresh 
tickle curls down his forehead to his eyes which are just now beginning 
to open and focus.  Juana is finishing tying his left ankle to the chair 
leg.  Johnnie moans and Juana brings her big, smiling face up in front 
of his.

				JUANA
		Johnnie, you take a good look at me,
		baby, cause you gonna hafta watch
		close to know when we do it to ya...
		Yall count when I touch the bottle -
		HO!!...
			(she slaps Johnnie hard

		pay attention fucka - otherwise we 
		hafta work it all night...  Too 
		much fun for us - you see what I 
		mean?  Now watch me how I touch a
		bottle and you count how many times.

Juana steps two paces across the hut where two dirty old soda bottles 
sit - one in one corner perched on a dried tree trunk - the other in the 
opposite corner perched on an old fence post.  Juana touches the left 
bottle (#1) once, and crosses and touches the right bottle (#2) once and 
comes back and touches Johnnies face.

				JUANA
		You see, Johnnie.  I toucha number
		one bottle once, I toucha number two
		bottle once, and I touch your face.
		This is a game we love to play.  I
		get hot already...  Now you meet 
		second Mr. Killer...  Does he fish
		or dont he?

Reggie and Drop Shadow step out of the darkness behind Johnnie and come 
around to face him.

				REGGIE
		Hey, Johnnie...  Reggie - you remember
		Reggie, dont ya?  Look what I caught.
			(to Juana)
		Im gettin hot too, mama.

Reggie and Juana kiss hot in front of Johnnie.  Juana puts her face down 
in front of Johnnies again.

				JUANA
		Now Johnnie...  We want to feel the

		I cant stop her, Johnnie...  She
		gets me too hot doin this...  Im

		stand right behind ya with this big

Reggie reaches his hand around in front of Johnnie - showing him a .45 
Automatic.

				DROP SHADOW
		Thats a Marine issue.  It goes off
		somethin terrible - you wanna see?

Drop Shadow pulls the hammer back which makes a loud click.

				JUANA
		You hear click?

Johnnie jumps as Drop Shadow blows a big hole in the far wall in front 
of Johnnie.

				REGGIE
			(laughs)
		Hell, its even worse than I 
		remember...  Wait a minute...

Reggie comes out in front of Johnnie - Juana grabs him.  They kiss hot 
again.

				JUANA
		Okay, gimmee nother kiss, Reggie
		bfore I fuck ya right now...
		FUCKIN HOT NOW, REGGIE.
		    (she opens her mouth with 
		     her tongue sticking out)
		FUCKIN HOT!

Juana screams like a monster from hell coming up close to Johnnies 
face.

				JUANA
		You think you gonna live through

		SMELL YO SHIT NOW, JOHNNIE.  GIVE
		US ONE MO KISS, REGGIE.  OH FUCK

Reggie goes back behind Johnnie quick.

				JUANA

		FUCKIN PUSSY - GO OUT NOW...  NOW I GO

		TOUCH A NUMBER ONE BOTTLE - WAIT NOW!!!
		...  REGGIE...  YOU SHOW NOW-

Reggie reaches his hand around Johnnies face - tears off tape and gag - 
then opens his hand and shows Johnnie a cufflink with a particular 
design in turquoise, orange, and silver.

				REGGIE
		I forgot to show you this.  The
		gentlemen that gave this to me said
		youd recognize it.  Said he wanted 
		itd be bout the last thing you ever
		saw in this life.

				JOHNNIE

  Oh God...  OH GOD...  Santos...  
		Oh God Marietta ... are you in on

				JUANA
		I GO ROUND AND ROUND - DO I TOUCH A
		SECOND BOTTLE BFORE I TOUCH JOHNNIE
		- DO I?  DO I???.........
		    (very quietly and breathy)
		No...  I touch Johnnie.

As her finger touches Johnnies face there is a loud CLICK.  Johnnie 
moans and closes his eyes.

				JUANA
			(counting fast)
		One ... two ... three ... four ...
		five ... GETTIN TOO FUCKIN HOT, 
		REGGIE...  FEELIN MYSEF ... six

Johnnie starts to scream and violently try to move out of his chair.

				JUANA
		Nine...
		   (she moves out of the way)
		FUCK ME NOW, REGGIE...  TEN!!!

We see a hole in the front of the barrel - BOOM!!!

The opposite wall and bottles get covered with blood.  Juana and Reggie 
race into each others arms and kiss right above Johnnies dead, 
bloodied head.

				LULA
		God, Sailor...  Thats the night my

		I know, sugar...  But while the place

		When I met you, I always liked to

The livingroom is on fire.

The livingroom is on fire and we move upstairs - Lula races through the 
smoke-filled hallway to her mothers bedroom.

The livingroom is on fire and Lula throws open the door to her mothers 
bedroom just in time to see Marcello Santos leaving through a window.  
Her mother laughs a wild, crazy laugh - exactly the same laugh Lula 
heard on the porch of the Cape Fear Hotel.

				LULA

		So Sailor, our histories have been

				SAILOR
		They have, sugar.

		Well, were really out in the middle

		I do trust you, Sailor.  Like I

		Well be alright, peanut, long as 
		weve got room to move.

				LULA
		   (looking into the highway)
		Whats that?

				SAILOR
		I dont know...  Looks like clothes.

Sailor starts to slow down.  The highway is suddenly littered with 
clothes strewn everywhere and two open suitcases smashed near the side 
of the road.  Sailor slows down to a crawl.  He and Lula turn to each 
other - theyve just seen TWO DEAD BODIES.  One close to the side of the 
highway - and other just off in the desert brush.  Off behind is an 
overturned car.

				LULA
		Oh God, Sailor.


				SAILOR
		One bad car accident...

				LULA
		SAILOR!!!

Coming out of the darkness is a YOUNG GIRL, her clothes half torn off - 
blood draining out of several deep wounds.

				LULA
		Sailor, what are we gonna do?

				SAILOR
		I dont know, honey, but we gotta 
		help that girl - get her to a town and
		hope no one catches on I broke parole.

They get out of the car and the girl comes toward them screaming.

				GIRL

		Ive got about five hundred dollars 
		in my wallet and I cant find it...
		My mothers going to kill me.  Its 
		got all my cards in it...  It was

The girl starts walking back toward the car.

				SAILOR
		Lets get ahold a her quick.

				LULA
		You think shes gonna make it?

				SAILOR
		Dont know, but shes gonna bleed
		all over our car, Ill tell ya that...
		           (to Girl)
		Hey...  Hello...  Girl...  You gotta
		come with us, honey.

Sailor reaches out cautiously and takes hold of the girls arm.

				GIRL
		OWWW GOD!!!  LEAVE ME ALONE...
		ROBERT!!!...  Shit, I got this damn
		sticky stuff in my hair...

She keeps digging her fingers into a bloody wound in her head.

				GIRL
		Gotta find my wallet.
			(to Sailor)
		Dont you say one word of this to
		my mother.  God, shes gonna kill me.

The girls falls to one knee and struggles to get back up.  Sailor and 
Lula each take an arm and try to help her.

				GIRL
		WHERES MY HAIRBRUSH?...

Sailor and Lula help the girl stand, but her eyes start rolling back and 
a bunch of fresh blood comes gushing up out of her mouth.

				LULA
		I cant take this, Sailor.  Shes
		dyin right in front of our eyes...

				SAILOR
		Im afraid she is, baby.

Sailor kneels down next to the girl and runs his hand gently across her 
forehead.

				GIRL
			(wide-eyed now)
		Get my lipstick...
			(whisper)
		Its in my purse.

The girl dies.  Sailor and Lula hold real still for a moment.  Lula 
starts to cry.

				LULA
		She died right in front of me.  Whyd
		she have to go and do that, Sailor?

				SAILOR
		Lets get outta here, honey.

Before getting up, Sailor lets his hand come off the girls forehead 
down over her eyes - closing them.  He puts his hand on her cheek then 
gets up.  He puts his arm around Lula and they go back to her car.  
Sailor helps Lula in on her side and closes the door for her.  He goes 
around, gets in and looks over at Lula, who breaks down crying harder.  
Sailor starts the car and takes off.

				RED
			(with a smile)
		Well, I aint Blackie.

Sailor holds out his right hand to shake.

				SAILOR
		Names Sailor Ripley.  Katy over at

Red extends his oil-blackened right hand and shakes.

				RED
		Things aint real hot right now.
		Rex, there though,

				SAILOR
		I aint no Enzo Ferrari, but they

				RED
		Well see how she goes then when
		Rex takes off.  Check back.

Two men, SPARKY and BUDDY, both about forty, walk up to Red.  One of 
them wears a grey baseball cap with a Confederate flag on it and the 
other has an LBJ straw Stetson.

				SPARKY
		Hows it look?

				RED
		Reckon the heads cracked, like I

				SPARKY
		Shit, thats what I was afraid of.

				RED
		Ill get you foreigners a beer.



				BUDDY

		Im Buddy, and this heres Sparky.

Sailor introduces himself to Sparky and Buddy and Rex.  They all shake 
hands or nod and move out of the sun to drink their beers.

				SAILOR
		My girl and I are lookin for a 
		place to settle.  Were bunked down
		at the Iguana Motel.

				SPARKY
		So are we.  Its the only motel in 
		Big Tuna.  Have you met Bobby Just

				SAILOR
		No, we just got in a hour and a

				BUDDY
		You will.  Hes the Mr. Fix-It at

				REX
		Escaped con.  Man got some serious
		prison tattoos.

				RED
		Everbody got a past.

				BUDDY
		Just some got more future in em

		That aint no lie.

Sailor finishes his beer, stands it on the ground and steps on it, 
crushing it flat.

				SAILOR
		Been nice meetin yall.  Preciate
		the beer.  Ill be seein yall

				LULA

				SAILOR
		You sick?

				LULA
		A little, I think...  Darlin?

				SAILOR
		Yeah?

				LULA
		Come sit by me.

Sailor goes over and sits on the bed.

				LULA
		I dont know that this is the right

Sailor strokes Lulas head.

Lula closes her eyes.

129. INT. IGUANA MOTEL - COURTYARD - NIGHT

Sailor, Lula, Sparky, and Buddy are sitting in the courtyard of the 
motel sharing Sparkys fifth of Ezra Brooks.  An electric bug killer is 
working overtime.  Buddy is reading from a newspaper.

				BUDDY
		     (reading from paper)
		Robert Brenton, twenty-five, was 
		killed when his car went off the road
		on State Highway 118, according to the
		Department of Public Safety.  Brenton
		and two passengers, William Reese and
		Susan Day, were thrown from the 
		automobile, reports said.

Sailor looks at Lula.

				SAILOR
		Susan Day...

The assistant manager, TOMMY THOMPSON, speaks from the shadows behind 
the group.

				TOMMY
		Robert Brenton, that dumb fuck.  That
		stupid shit...  That fuckin Bob was
		so fuckin dumb...  He deserved to
		die...  That asshole.

They all look over at Tommy.

				BUDDY
		Hey, Tommy...  Whats goin on over
		there in number four where al them 
		bright lights are all the time?

				TOMMY
		Them are makin a pornographic movie...
		Texas style...  Why?  You wanna join in?

				SPARKY
		How do you get sixteen Haitians into
		a Dixie Cup?

				LULA
		How?

				SPARKY
		Tell em it floats.

				BUDDY
		Sparkys big on Florida jokes.

				SPARKY
		You need a active sense of humor to
		survive in the Big Tuna.

BOBBY PERU walks in and comes over.

				BOBBY
		Hey, everybody.

				BUDDY
		Sailor, Lula, this heres the man 
		himself.  Bobby, this is Sailor
		and Lula, the most recent strandees,
		economic variety.

Bobby nods to Lula and offers a hand to Sailor.

				BOBBY
		Bobby Peru, just like the country.

Sparky and Buddy laugh.

				BUDDY
		Accordin to Red and Rex, Bobbys
		the most excitin item to hit Big
		Tuna since the 86 cyclone sheared
		the roof off the high school.

				SPARKY
		Only in town two months and there 
		aint a young thing around dont 
		know how that cobra tattoo works, 
		right, Bob?

Bobby laughs.  He has a lopsided grin that exposes only three brownish 
front teeth and he has flat black eyes that seem to reflect no light.

				LULA
		You from Texas, Mr. Peru?

Bobby pulls up a chair and pours himself a shotglass full of whiskey.

				BOBBY
		Im from all over.

				SAILOR
		    (noticing a USMC tattoo
		     on Bobbys right hand)
		You was in the Marines, huh?

Bobby looks down at his hand, flexs it.

				BOBBY
		Four years.

				SPARKY
		Bobby was at Cao Ben.

				LULA
		Whats Cao Ben?

				BOBBY
			(to Lula)
		How old are you?

				LULA
		Twenty.

				BUDDY
		Lotta women and kids and old people
		died at Cao Ben.

				BOBBY
		March, 1968.  We torched a village
		and the government made a big deal
		out of it.

Bobby sips the whiskey and closes his eyes for several seconds before 
reopening them and looking at Buddy.  His eyes open slowly and they 
practically burn a hole in Buddy.

				BOBBY
			(to Buddy)
		You was on a ship, pardner.  Hard to
		make contact with the people when
		youre off floatin in the Gulf of
		Tonkin.

				SPARKY
		    (changing the subject)
		Hey Bobby, have yourself another 
		glass a Jack.

Sparky refills Bobbys shotglass.  Bobby tosses it back in one gulp.

				BOBBY
		Dont mind if I fuckin do...  
		Speakin a Jack...  One-eyed Jacks
		yearnin to go a peepin in a
		seafood store...  Good meetin you.
		Adios, boys.

He walks out and after hes gone...

				LULA
		Somethin in that man scares me.

				BUDDY
		No shit.


				SPARKY
		  (pouring himself another shot)
		Bobbys got a way...  Cant shake
		that institution odor.

Lula puts a hand on Sailors leg.

				LULA
		Darlin, I still aint feelin so 
		well.  Im goin to bed.

				SAILOR

They say goodnight to Sparky and Buddy and head for their room.

Lula goes right to the bed and flops down on it.

				SAILOR
		Anything I can do for you?

				LULA
		No, I dont think so, Sail.  I
		just need to lie down.

Lula listens to Sailor brush his teeth, urinate into the toilet and 
flush it.  Sailor comes out of the bathroom and climbs into bed.

				LULA
		Sailor?  You know what?

				SAILOR
		I know you aint particularly pleased
		bein here.

				LULA
		Not that.  Look at what I wrote down
		cause I cant say it.

Lula hands Sailor a note which reads Im pregnant.  Sailor looks into 
her eyes.

				SAILOR
		Its okay by me, peanut.

				LULA
		Well, nothin personal, but I aint
		sure its okay by me.

Sailor crumples the note and puts it in the ashtray.


				LULA
		Really, Sailor, it aint nothin 
		against you.  I love you.

				SAILOR
		Love you, too.

				LULA
		I know.  Just Im sorta uncomfortable

				BOBBY
		Hey, pretty woman...  Sailor here?

				LULA
		No, hes out changin the oil in

				BOBBY
		Man, I gotta take a piss bad...  Can

				PERDITA
			(recognizing him)
		Oh...  Look at this...  What do you

				SAILOR
		You heard right.

				PERDITA
		You really are one dumb asshole.

				SAILOR
		Life is unpredictable.

Suddenly Bobby jumps back, shakes his head and straightens his hair.

				BOBBY
		Hey...  Im sorry...  I dont think

With all the strength she can muster, Lula slaps Bobby across the face.

Bobby moves in very close to her - Lulas trembling.  Bobby puts his 
hand on her neck and moves it up and down behind her ear.

				BOBBY
		Say it...  Then Ill leave...  Whisper

		Whisper fuck me...

His hand moves down over her breasts - down across her stomach - and

Bobby returns from the jukebox and sits down next to Sailor.

Pee Wees steel guitar ripples through the cigarette haze and buzzes 
around Sailors head.  His reflection wobbles in the long mirror behind 
the bar.

				BOBBY

				SAILOR
		Whats that?

				BOBBY
		Feed store keeps up to five K in

Sailor stares at Bobby and works hard to focus his eyes.

				SAILOR
		No...  I dont think so, man.

		Be easy, Sailor.  Theres two employees.

136A. EXT. ROARITAS - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Bobby looks around in the purple twilight before he opens the trunk of 
the Eldorado.  He peels back a brown army blanket.

				BOBBY
		Thats a double-barreled, sawed-off,
		Ithaca shotgun with a carved pistol
		grip stock wrapped with adhesive tape.
		Next to its a cold Smith and Wesson
		.32 handgun with a six inch barrel.
		Thesell do er...  Loosen up that

Bobby closes the trunk.  Sailor stands - hesitating to commit.

Sailor stares at him and his fist clenches.

				BOBBY
		Hey...  I never said you was a pussy...
		Always figured you had the big ol

				SAILOR
		What could I be up to, Lula?

				LULA
		Hes a stone fuckin criminal, honey,

				SAILOR
		Lula, he mighta did, I dont know.
		But it dont matter now.  Lotta guys

Lula puffs hard on her cigarette.

Sailor turns on his side, away from Lula, and pulls a pillow over his

				BOB RAY
		Hey Sailor...  Wait a minute...  I

As Bob Ray passes Lula on the stairs - he puts his hand between her 
legs.  Sailor starts to see red.  Bob Ray smiles and steps down to 
Sailor.  He leans in and whispers in Sailors ear.

		Shit, man...  Marietta says you been

		Marietta just gave me this to kill

Bob Ray pulls a knife, but Sailors fist is already halfway through Bob 
Rays brain.  From there, Sailor steps firmly into the crazy zone.  
Amidst blood-curdling hysterical screams from a growing throng of 
SOUTHERN BELLES, Sailor starts taking Bob Ray apart limb by limb and 
doesnt stop until Bob Ray lays completely destroyed and completely dead

		Maybe hell get a little nervous,
		but who gives a shit?

Bobby lowers his hands into the front of Perditas blouse and cups her 
breasts.  She burns the back of his left wrist with her cigarette.  
Bobby jumps back, then grabs Perditas hair and pulls her over the couch 
onto the floor.  Neither of them speak.  She tries to stand, but Bobby 
keeps his right foot on her chest while he blows the back of his wounded 
wrist.  Perdita shoves his leg to one side and rolls away.  She stand up 
and spits at him.

				BOBBY
			(grinning)
		I knew we could be friends again...

141. INT. IGUANA MOTEL - DAY

Lula lays very still on the bed.  Her head is close to the small 
turquoise radio on the bedside table.  She is listening to a piece of 
sad, nostalgic music and as we move in closer to her and the radio - the 
volume increases.

Lula remembers some moments in her life with Sailor: (Music continues 
over)

When he kissed her outside the jail gate.

When he touched her breast the day after he got out of jail.

When they sat behind the Confederate Soldier.

When they danced to Slaughter House.

Suddenly, Lula sees an image in her mind that she does not recognize.  
She sees an abstract image of reflected light with two eyes looking 
through it at her.  The image puzzles her.

(The Music continues over)

								CUT TO:

142. EXT. IGUANA MOTEL - DAY

The big Eldorado pulls up in front of the Iguana Motel where Sailor has 
been waiting in the hot sun.  Bobby opens the door.

				BOBBY
		Jump in back.

Sailor crawls in the back seat and sees Perdita just as she floors it 
and they take off in a cloud of dust.


142A. INT. ELDORADO - BIG TUNA - DAY

				SAILOR
		Whats she doin here?

				BOBBY
		Shes my girl...  Shes drivin...
		That bother you?

				SAILOR
		Why should it?

				BOBBY
		Thats right...  Take one of these.

				SAILOR
		What is it?

				BOBBY
		Panty hose.  Work bettern stockins.
		Pull one of the legs down over your
		face and let the other leg trail
		behind your head.  You get the pistol.
			(hands him the .32)
		Remember, soon as we get inside, you
		keep that bad boy up where those 
		hicks can see it.  Once they notice
		the Ithaca and the Smith, theyll 
		know we aint foolin with em.

				PERDITA
		Comin up on it now, Bobby.

								CUT TO:

143. EXT. RAMOS FEED STORE - DAY

Bobby slips the panty hose over his head and adjusts it.  His face looks 
crooked and distorted.

				BOBBY
		     (frightening whisper)
		Come on!  Get that mask on!

Sailor rips open the package and pulls a nylon leg over his head, 
stretching the calf part to fit.

Perdita pulls up in front of the store.  The street is deserted.

				BOBBY
		Keep it revved, Chiquita.  We wont
		be long.  Just goin in to get our
		five grand.

CUT TO:								

144. INT. RAMOS FEED STORE - FRONT OFFICE - DAY

Bobby and Sailor enter the feed store.  Bobby raises his sawed-off 
shotgun and points it at the TWO OLD MEN behind the counter.

				BOBBY
		Into the back room, both of you, 
		NOW!!!

Bobby and the two men head down the hall into the back room.

				BOBBY
		    (calling back to Sailor)
		If anyone comes in, herd em back
		here quick.

								CUT TO:

145. EXT. RAMOS FEED STORE - DAY

Suddenly, an Iguana County DEPUTY SHERIFF cruises up in a patrol car and 
parks it on angle in front of the idling Eldo.  The Deputy gets out of 
his car and walks over to the drivers side of the Eldorado.

				DEPUTY
		Waitin for somebody, Miss?

				PERDITA
		Mi esposo.  Hes in the feed store
		picking up some supplies.

				DEPUTY
		Youd best be careful of that cigarette,
		Maam.  Its about to burn down 
		between your fingers.

Perdita stubs out her Marlboro in the ashtray.

				PERDITA
		Gracias, officer.

								CUT TO:

146. INT. RAMOS FEED STORE - FRONT OFFICE - DAY

The two old guys have their hands in the air and are moving back behind 
the counter.  Bobby is just finishing tying off a bag of money.  Sailor 
is by the front door holding his pistol on the two old guys.  When Bobby 
finishes tying the money bag - he lifts the shotgun and blows a hole 
through the chest of one of the old men.  Sailor goes into shock.

				SAILOR
		BOBBY!!!!  STOP IT, MAN!!!


CUT TO:

147. EXT. RAMOS FEED STORE - DAY

Reacting to the shot, Perdita jams the gear shift into reverse and peels 
out, knocking the deputy down.

								CUT TO:

148. INT. RAMOS FEED STORE - FRONT OFFICE - DAY

Sailor turns his pistol on Bobby now.  Bobby spins his shotgun around 
and points it at Sailor.

				BOBBY
		Youre next, fucker.

The second old man is reaching under the counter.

Sailor fires his .32 at Bobby.  There are no live bullets in his pistol.  
It just makes a dry click.  Bobby smiles and is just about to kill 
Sailor when out of the corner of his eye he catches sight of the second 
old man bringing out a big shotgun of his own.  Bobby instinctively 
spins and empties the second barrel of his two-barrel shotgun into the 
old gentleman.  As Bobby is reloading fast, Sailor sprints through the 
front door.  Bobby is right behind him as he flys out the front door.


148A. EXT. RAMOS FEED STORE - DAY

The deputy recovers and comes up on one knee with his revolver clasped 
in both hands.  He fires his first shot into Bobbys thigh and his 
second into Bobbys left hip.  The shock of the initial slug causes 
Bobby to drop the bag.  The impact of the second forces Bobbys right 
hand to twist sideways to that both barrels of the shotgun wedge under 
his chin.  The Ithaca goes off, blowing Bobby backwards through the 
RAMOS on the plate glass window of the feed store.

Sailor hits the ground - losing the Smith as he falls.  He puts his hand 
over his hosieried head and keeps his face in the dirt until the deputy 
orders him to stand up.

								CUT TO:

149. INT. IGUANA COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

Lula is sitting on a bench in the waiting room of the Iguana County 
Courthouse Building when Marietta and Santos walk in.  As soon as she 
sees Lula, Marietta runs over, sits down next to her and hugs and kisses 
her.

				MARIETTA
		Oh baby, I was beginnin to think 
		I was never gonna see you again.

Tears are pouring down Mariettas cheeks.  She holds Lula to her and 
Lula does not resist.  Lula just stares at Santos.

				MARIETTA
		Youre comin home, precious.  Santos
		gonna drive us to the San Antonio
		airport.

				LULA
		Mama, Sailors in deep trouble here.
		I just cant leave him.

Marietta takes Lula by the shoulders and looks straight at her.  Lulas 
eyes are bloodshot, her hair is greasy and stringy, and her cheeks are 
pale.

				MARIETTA
		Oh, yes, you can.

Santos steps forward.  Lula begins to tremble.

				SANTOS
		Your mamas been real worried bout
		you, honey.  Me too...  Can you
		give your old friend Santos a hug,
		too?

Santos arms begin to go around Lula.  Lula lets out a blood-curdling 
scream and shakes like a leaf on a tree.  Santos grabs her hard - in a 
bear hug.  On one shirt cuff we see a cufflink which is turquoise, 
orange, and silver.

150. INT. WALLS UNIT - DAY

Sailor lays on his jail bed reading a letter from Lula.

				LULA
			(voice-over)

Dearest Sailor Darling,

The first thing youll want to know is Im keeping the baby.
Mama wasnt for it in the beginning but I think shes looking
forward to it.  Im gonna name it Pace no matter if its a 
boy or a girl.  Pace Ripley sounds good, dont it?  Its
kind of hard to believe that Pace will be six years old 
when you get out.

I feel like Im kind of in prison too, but I know in six
months, itll be over and Ill have a son or daughter to
show for it.  Our child!!

I love you Sailor.  I dont know how much or what it 
means though I miss you an awful bunch sometimes I know
youre thinking about me cause I can feel it.  I miss
you not being around to call me peanut nobody else ever
called me that.

Mama married Santos.  It just about drove me crazy.  My
daddy left a lot of money somehow and theyre spending
it like there is no tomorrow.  Im going to move out as
soon as I can.

Mama and Santos said because of the baby theyre lookin
at the two of us in a different light - whatever that
means.

Johnnie Farragut has plumb disappeared.  No one knows
where.  I miss him, but not near as much as I miss you.

Time dont really fly honey does it?

Love,
your Lula

P.S. I miss dancing...

								CUT TO:

151. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

Lula sits in her bedroom reading a letter from Sailor.

				SAILOR
			(voice-over)

Dear Lula,

It is fine with me about the baby as you already know. 
And Pace being your family name and all is just right.
What about a middle name if it is a boy after my 
granddaddy Roscoe?  He would be proud I know though
he is long passed.  Pace Roscoe Ripley does not sound
so bad do you think?

This place is not so pretty as Pee Dee.  Not pretty
at all.  There are boys inside these walls meaner
than Peru you can bet.  There is a Death House.  I
am getting along.  The only thing is not thinking
about the future.

I miss dancing with you, too.  I love you.  It is
hard to end this letter.  If I stop writing youre
gone.  There is not a lot more to say though.
Vava con dios mi amor.

Sailor

LONG FADE OUT:

153. INT. LULA FORTUNES HOUSE - EVENING - (SIX YEARS LATER)

Six years later...  Lula stands in the living room holding a glass of 
ice water while talking on the telephone to her mother.  Marietta is 
wearing a giant diamond ring on one hand and the other hand is holding a 
Martini and Rossi sweet vermouth.  Marietta is slumped over in an 
ottoman with wheels and is pushing her drunken self around the 
livingroom as she talks on the phone.

				LULA
		Im goin, mama.  No way I cant go.

				MARIETTA
		You aint takin Pace, though.

				LULA
		Course I am, mama.

				MARIETTA
			(sighs)
		What times Sailors train get in?

				LULA
		Six.

				MARIETTA
		Got any plans?

				LULA
		Figure well go have supper someplace.
		Maybe get some barbecue out by 
		Stateline.  Sailor always liked that
		Havana Browns Pig Pickin.

				MARIETTA
		Well, you be careful with that boy,
		Lula.

				LULA
		Sailor aint a boy no more, mama.

				MARIETTA
		Dont mean him.  Its Pace concerns me.

				LULA
		Really, mama, I gotta go.

				MARIETTA
		What if I asked you not to?

				LULA
		Wouldnt make any difference.

				MARIETTA
		What if I told you not to?

				LULA
			(forcefully)
		Mama ... if you get in the way of
		me and Sailors happiness, Ill
		fuckin pull your arms out by the
		roots.

Lula hangs up and throws her glass of water at a picture of her mother - 
draining it.

								CUT TO:

154. INT. LULAS CAR - EVENING

PACE ROSCOE FORTUNE is a shy, polite, innocent six-year old who wears a 
long-billed fishing cap and pants with suspenders.

				PACE
		Howll we know what he looks like?

Lula makes a wide left turn onto Jeff Davis Highway without signaling, 
causing the driver of a white Bonneville headed across the intersection 
to jam on his brakes in order to avoid a collision.  The Bonneville 
driver sits on his horn and shouts at Lula.

				PACE
		Mama, you almost crashed us.

Lula steadies the steering wheel of her Camaro with her left elbow while 
she strikes a match and lights up a More.  She throws the match out the 
window and takes possession of the wheel with both hands, the cigarette 
is clamped in her teeth.

				LULA
		Dont give me no trouble now, Pace,
		please.  This aint the easiest day
		in a long time.  And what do you
		mean how are we gonna know what your
		daddy looks like?  You seen his photo.


				PACE
		Howll he know what we look like?
		He seen our photo?

Lula puffs furiously several times on her More before she takes it out 
of her mouth and drops it.

				LULA
		Damn it, child!  Now look what you
		made me do.

				PACE
		What I made you do, mama?

Lula feels around on the floor with one hand until she finds the 
cigarette.  Sirens can be heard up ahead.

				LULA
		Nothin, honey. 
		  (stubbing it out in the ashtray)
		Mamas just actin strange.

				PACE
		You aint actin, mama.

				LULA
		Why, Pace Roscoe Ripley, aint you
		got one cute mouth tonight?

They pass an automobile accident where a man has been thrown into the 
curb - his head broken open and bleeding.  The ambulance is just 
arriving.  Lula looks away.

								CUT TO:

155. ACCIDENT - EVENING

A CRAZY MAN in a wheelchair is wheel up to the accident victim, who is 
bleeding profusely and in a state of shock.  The man in the wheelchair 
stares at him for a moment.

156. INT. LULAS CAR - EVENING

Pace looks up at his mother.

				PACE
		I still aint sure what my daddy

				LULA
		Like you, sweetheart.  You and your
		daddy got the same mouth, eyes, ears,
		and nose.  Only difference is your
		color hair is like mine.

				PACE
		My daddy aint never killed nobody,
		has he, mama?

				LULA
		Course he aint never killed nobody.
		Whyd you say that, Pace?

				PACE
		Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama
		talkin.

				LULA
		And?

				PACE
		Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.

				LULA
		Wrong, baby.  Your daddy never 
		committed no murder.  Musta been you 
		didnt hear grandmama proper.  He made 
		some mistakes, is all.  Your daddy aint 
		always been so lucky...  Were almost

								CUT TO:

157. EXT. TRAIN STATION - EVENING

Lula pulls the Camaro into in the station parking lot and kills the 
engine.

				PACE
		Why we sittin here, mama?

				LULA
		Thinkin a second, baby.

Lula gets out and goes around for Pace.  They hold hands as they walk 
toward the station.  The big clock on the side of the building shows ten 
minutes past six.

				PACE
		Im scared, mama.

				LULA
		Why, honey?

				PACE
		Case daddy dont like me.  What if
		he dont like that I dont got 
		his color hair.

				LULA
		Pace, your daddyd love you even
		if you didnt have no hair at all.

CUT TO:								

158. INT. TRAIN STATION - EVENING

Lula sees Sailor as soon as she opens the door.  He is sitting in an 
orange plastic chair against the opposite wall, smoking a cigarette.

				LULA
		Still partial to Camels, huh?

Sailor smiles.

				SAILOR
		First pack of tailor-mades I had in
		a while.

He stands up and looks down at Pace, who is still holding hands with 
Lula.  Sailor puts out his right hand.

				SAILOR
		You must be my son.

				LULA
		Shake hands with your daddy.

Pace releases Lulas hand and puts his own in Sailors.  Sailor grips it 
gently but firmly, pumps once, then lets go.

				SAILOR
		Pleasure to meet you, Pace.  I read
		a lot about you.

Sailor looks at Lula.  Her eyes are full of tears and she lets them 
loose.  Sailor tries to smile.

				LULA
		You hungry?  Pace and I aint had
		dinner yet.

				SAILOR
		Lead the way.

Sailor picks up his black metal suitcase and follows them to the car.

CUT TO:								

159. INT. LULAS CAR - NIGHT

Lula drives.

				SAILOR
		No rag top, huh?

Lula starts to reply, then stops.  She stares straight ahead, gripping 
the wheel hard.  Suddenly, she pulls over to the side of the road, turns 
off the engine and gets out of the car.

				PACE
		Whats wrong, mama?

				SAILOR
		     (turning to Pace and 
			patting his head)
		Dont worry, son.  Just stay here.

Sailor gets out and goes over to Lula, who is leaning back against the 
hood.

				LULA
		Im sorry, Sailor.  I just cant 
		help it.  Give me a minute and Ill
		quit.

				SAILOR
		Boys frightened, Lula.  This aint
		no good.

				LULA
		Really, Sail, Ill be okay.

				SAILOR
		Its a mistake, honey.  You two go on.
		Ill walk back to the depot.

				LULA
		Whatre you talkin about?  Thats 
		your son in there.

				SAILOR
		He aint never known me, Lula, so 
		there aint much for him to forget.
		Not seein each other for six years
		makes it next best to simple for us, too.

				LULA
		How can you say that, Sailor?

				SAILOR
		What makes sense, is all.

Sailor goes around to the drivers side, reaches in and pulls the keys 
out of the ignition.  He unlocks the trunk, removes his suitcase, and 
closes the lid.

				LULA
		Dont do this, Sailor, please.

Sailor slips the keys in her shirt pocket and leans his head into the 
car.

				SAILOR
			(to Pace)
		Oiga, amigo.  If ever somethin 
		dont feel right to you, remember what
		Pancho said to The Cisco Kid...  
		Lets went, before we are dancing at
		the end of a rope, without music.

Sailor stands up and looks at Lula.  Her eye makeup runs in dark streaks 
down her face.

ECU of Lulas eyes.  Her eye makeup runs like black sweat over eyes and 
down her cheeks as in Sailors dream.

				SAILOR
		You been doin fine without me, peanut. 
		There aint no need to make life 
		toughern it has to be.

He picks up his suitcase, kisses Lula lightly on the lips and walks 
away.  She lets him go.

								CUT TO:

160. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Sailor walks down the street pretending hard not to care.

								CUT TO:

161. INT. LULAS CAR - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Lula climbs in behind the wheel - sobbing.  Pace sits sadly, staring out 
the window.

								CUT TO:

162. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Sailor continues walking down the street.  A GANG OF INSANE KILLER 
TEENAGERS on PCP appear and come towards Sailor.  They circle around 
him, coming in closer for the kill.

				SAILOR
		What do you faggots want?

Thats all it takes.  The gang is on him.  Sailor tries to defend 
himself, but one big punch to his nose sends him down and out.  Blood 
begins to pour from his swelling nose.


162A. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

CU OF SAILORS FACE - a bright light illuminates it.

In the sky above Sailor, a large glowing bubble holding the beautiful 
Good Witch of the North comes floating down above him.

				GOOD WITCH
		Sailor Ripley...

Sailors eyes suddenly see the Good Witch through his closed eyelids.  
His mouth speaks through closed lips.

				SAILOR
		The Good Witch...

				GOOD WITCH
		Sailor...  Lula loves you.

				SAILOR
		But Im a robber and a manslaughterer
		and I havent had any parental 
		guidance.

				GOOD WITCH
		Shes forgiven you of all these things
		...  You love her...  Dont be
		afraid, Sailor.

				SAILOR
		But Im wild at heart.

				GOOD WITCH
		If you are truly wild at heart, youll
		fight for your dreams...  Dont turn
		away from love, Sailor...  Dont turn
		away from love...  Dont turn away
		from love.

The Good Witch disappears.


162. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Sailor opens his eyes and drags himself and his giant swollen nose up on 
his feet.  The gang still stands around him.

				GANG MEMBER
		You had enough, asshole?

				SAILOR
		Yes, I have...  And I wanna apologize
		to you gentlemen for referring to 
		you as homosexuals.  I also want to
		thank you fellas, youve taught me
		a valuable lesson in life.

Sailor turns around and starts running back.  The gang watches him go.

								CUT TO:

163. INT. LULAS CAR - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Lula sits in the car in the middle of a giant traffic jam.  She is still 
crying and horns are honking all around them.

								CUT TO:

164. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Sailor runs up the street, holding his nose and SCREAMING LULAS NAME.

He rounds a corner and spots her in the middle of a sea of cars.

He starts running towards her - leaping from one car to another until he 
jumps on the hood of Lulas car.

She sees him.

				SAILOR
		LULA!!!!

				LULA
		SAILOR!!!!

Lula wriggles out of the car and flys into his arms.  Behind them is a 
giant golden sunset.  As they embrace - the sound of the horns goes 
away.  Lulas gaze goes to a reflection of golden light on a windshield.  
It is the same abstract scene she saw before in her room in Big Tuna, 
but now she knows what it is.  It is Paces happy, smiling eyes looking 
up at the two of them in love.

Sailor, with a giant blue nose, looks into Lulas eyes and sings Love 
Me Tender. 

The people in their cars, and the people on the street look on with a 
feeling of love and happiness in their hearts.

     EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY

     A place of money and privilege.  White coral buildings surround
     an open yard.  Tile roofs rise among banyan trees and banana
     palms, shimmering before a blue blaze of sky.

     Beyond the yard is the school's playing field and beyond that the
     waters of Biscayne Bay, dappled in sunlight where the sloops of
     the school's sailing class bob at their moorings.

     For a moment all is quiet.  Then, faintly, the HUM of many
     VOICES, rising and falling, LAUGHTER.

     The CAMERA PANS to the open windows of a building somewhat larger
     than the others.  The SOUNDS grow louder.

     INT. BLUE BAY AUDITORIUM - DAY

     A hundred high school kids sit before a raised, hardwood stage.
     The students are not unlike the campus, radiant, well-tended -- a
     veritable sea of adolescent sexuality -- bronze boys who seem to
     have just come from the boats or tennis courts -- girls in tight
     shorts riding high up shapely thighs, as...

     SAM LOMBARDO strolls out onto the stage.  The man is thirtyish,
     drop-dead handsome.  Dressed not that differently from the kids,
     in an Izod polo shirt, khakis and boat shoes.

     His entrance has an effect upon the audience, particularly upon
     the girls.

     KAREN and JANELLE, 16, pretty blondes, whisper then giggle.

     NICOLE, a dark-eyed beauty, 17 but going on 25, watches Sam's
     walk, then turns to the girl at her side...

     KELLY VAN RYAN, 17, a fully-developed knockout.

                                  NICOLE
                  When we graduate the only thing I'm
                  going to miss is...
                         (with a nod to the stage)
                  Know what I mean?

     Kelly's eyes are locked on Sam.  Nicole has to nudge her.

                                  NICOLE (CONT'D)
                  Kelly?

                                  KELLY
                         (still staring)
                  Oh yeah.

     Sam is at the podium.  He looks out across the audience.  There
     are a couple of flirtatious whistles, laughter.  Sam smiles,
     silencing them with a wave of his hand.

                                  SAM
                  We've come to the halfway point in my
                  senior seminars...

     Cheers, applause.  Sam waits for the kids to settle.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  Come on.  Beats study hall, doesn't it?

                                  JIMMY (O.S.)
                  No!

     Boos as we FIND...

     JIMMY LEACH, 18, grumge look, long hair.  He sits with a clique
     of white trashy types, or at least what passes for such at Blue
     Bay School.  Jimmy appears a bit more genuine, as does...

     SUZlE TOLLER, a boyish brunette, seated nearby, but with just
     enough space between her and everyone else to mark her as a
     loner.  She studies Sam Lombardo with a dark, sullen stare.

                                  SAM
                  Thank you, Jimmy.

                                  JIMMY
                  Hey, man, at least in study hail I could
                  meditate.

                                  KIRK (O.S.)
                  He means masturbate...

     This remark is greeted by a chorus of laughter as we FIND...

     KIRK, one of the golden boys, seated with Kelly and Nicole.

                                  SAM
                  Something Kirk with which I'm sure you
                  have hands-on experience.

     Loud laughter.  Sam quiets them again, then turns to the
     blackboard, where he begins to write, in big letters -- S-E-X.
     The kids start to cheer.

     Sam writes another word -- C-R-I-M-E-S.

     The cheering fades into silence.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  We've all heard the words, date rape,
                  sexual harassment.  We've talked about
                  some of these things in this room.
                         (beat)
                  Our speakers today head up the Blue Bay
                  Police Sex Crimes Unit -- Detectives Ray
                  Duquette and Gloria Perez.
                         (beat)
                  They're here to give you what we hope
                  will be a fresh perspective on these
                  subjects, and to answer any questions
                  you night have.

     Sam turns to the wings, his hand out to welcome the visitors...

     RAY DUQUETTE, mid-thirties, with the lanky build of a light
     heavyweight, walks out onto the stage.  He's dressed in a dark
     suit, dark hair combed straight back above steel-rimmed glasses.

     GLORIA PEREZ walks at his side.  She's a good six inches shorter
     than Ray, with a sweet face.  Attractive but no stunner.

     About five kids applaud.  Ray takes the podium.

                                  RAY
                  Thank you for having us.  We'll each
                  talk for ten or fifteen minutes, then
                  open it up to your questions...

     IN THE AUDIENCE

     Suzie Toller suddenly gets to her feet.  As she passes behind
     Jimmy, we HEAR her VOICE, beneath her breath.

                                  SUZIE
                  I'm not going to listen to this
                  jack-off.

     She marches down the aisle and bangs out the rear door..

     Ray pauses, a dark look on his face, then goes on...

                                  RAY
                  Let's begin with a question.  What is a
                  sex crime?

     A moment.

                                  JIMMY
                  Not getting any.

     This draws a few laughs from the kids, a couple of thin smiles
     from Sam and Gloria.  And none at all from Ray Duquette.

     EXT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

     The kids change classes.  Sam, Ray and Gloria CROSS the grass.
     The kids swarm past.  A pair of girls flash by.

                                  CAROLE
                  Have a nice weekend, Mr. Lombardo.

                                  SAM

                  Hey, Carole, you too.  And be good.

                                  CAROLE
                         (beneath a pouty look)
                  I hate to be good.

     The three adults ENTER an old wooden building.

     INT. BUILDING - DAY

                                  SAM
                  This is one of the original buildings.
                  We have the offices here now.

     The walls are paneled in wood, decorated with framed photographs.
     Gloria stops before one of the photos.

     ANGLE ON PHOTOGRAPH

     An old black-and-white, with that sepia caste harkening back to
     another age.

     A handsome young man of perhaps 14 stands at the helm of a boat
     under sail.  His hair is swept back, his eyes fixed upon an
     unseen horizon.  There is something in this boy's pose, in the
     line of his jaw, in the clarity of his gaze, as if what he has
     fixed upon is the future itself.

                                  GLORIA
                  Anybody in particular?

     When no one answers, she turns to find Sam at her side.  He
     stares at the picture, then looks at Gloria.

                                  SAM
                  Sam Lombardo.  The first.  Class of
                  'Forty-Two
                         (beat)
                  My father.

     Gloria does a slow double-take, looking from Sam to the photo and
     back again.

                                  VOICE (0.S.)
                  Can't seem to get rid of the Lombardos
                  around here.

     Sam and the detectives turn as a professorial-looking guy in a
     baggy brown suit (ART MADDOX) arrives on the scene.

                                  SAM
                  Art.  Say hello to Detectives Perez and
                  Duquette.
                         (to the cops)
                  Art Maddox. A fellow guidance counselor.

     Art and the detectives shake hands.

                                  ART
                  So, did you set 'em all straight on the
                  ugly facts of life?

                                  SAM
                  I have the feeling, they got it down
                  already.  They're a step ahead of us,
                  Artie.

     Gloria seems to find this amusing.  Ray stands at her side, looks
     at Sam.  Sam feels it, makes eye contact with Ray -- a beat -- at
     which point, Ray puts a hand on Gloria's back.

                                  RAY
                  I've got that two o'clock in town.

                                  GLORIA
                         (nodding)
                  Back to the land of grownups.

     The detectives shake hands once more with San and Art.

                                  SAM
                         (to Gloria)
                  If old pictures interest you, come back
                  some time, there's quite a collection
                  down in the pagoda.  I'll see you get a
                  proper tour.

                                  GLORIA
                         (smiling)
                  I'd like that.

     Ray opens a door for her.  The detectives pass through it.

     Art claps Sam on the shoulder, then walks off down the hallway.
     Sam remains near the doors, watching as...

     ANGLE ON THE DRIVE LEADING TO THE SCHOOL

     Ray and Gloria walk past half a dozen expensive cars -- Range
     Rovers, Beamers and Mercedes, to a plain, white Ford Taurus,
     which they get into and drive away.

     EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL - LATER

     Cheerleaders perform a sensual dance on the porch of a wooden
     pagoda.  A rugby team runs drills on the grass, as out on the
     bay, six tiny racing sloops tack toward the docks.

     ANGLE ON DOCKS

     As the sloops enter the narrow channel between the slips one
     student from each boat jumps onto the dock where he or she sets
     about tying off the boat.

     Sam is on one of the boats.  Jimmy Leach is at the rudder.

                                  SAM
                         (loud enough to be heard
                          by his class)
                  Okay, you guys.  Good work.  Now coil
                  those dock lines and I'll see you all on
                  Monday.

     He watches his class clamber up the docks.  His eye falls upon
     the pagoda, the dancing cheerleaders -- Kelly Van Ryan in
     work-out tights -- bare arms reaching for the sky.

     EXT. SCHOOL DOCKS - SAM & JIMMY - LATER

     hosing down boats, stowing sails.  They look up as...
     A HUGE POWER BOAT glides past.  The docks rock in its wake.

                                  JIMMY
                  All right.  I could party on that.

     Sam just laughs at him.

                                  SAM
                  That's about all it's good for.
                         (beat)
                  That's the one to have.

     He points to a beautiful triple-masted schooner headed out of the
     bay, under sail.

                                  SAM
                  The Windward Passage.  I crewed on that
                  one summer.
                         (beat)
                  Long time ago.

     He pulls his eyes from the boat, sets about coiling a line.

                                  JIMMY
                  You know, I want to thank you for
                  getting me into this class...  No way was
                  my old man going to spring for the
                  fees...

                                  SAM
                  Hey, you're working for it.
                         (beneath a laugh)
                  Least you're supposed to be.

     He tosses Jimmy the coiled line.  Jimmy's caught off-guard, but
     catches it at the last second, then shares the laugh with Sam.

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                  Can I play too?  Or is it just for boys?

     Sam and Jimmy turn to find Kelly Van Ryan at the far end of the
     dock.  She's fresh from cheerleader practice, in a white blouse
     knotted at the bottom to REVEAL a flat, tanned stomach; open at
     the top to REVEAL the swelling of her breasts.  She favors Sam
     with a coy smile.

                                  KELLY
                  So who's washing your car this weekend,
                  Mr. Lombardo?
                         (off Sam's blank look)
                  The senior car wash, remember?
                         (beat)
                  Tamara's making a schedule.  She said
                  you bought a coupon but you're not on
                  anybody's list.

     Sam smiles, remembering.

                                  SAM
                  Well, you know.  Figured I'd buy a
                  Washing ticket, support the effort.
                  That old Jeep of mine's kind of a waste
                  of time, don't you think?

     Sam places the coiled hose on top of a locker then starts up the
     dock, Jimmy at his side.  Kelly falls in with then.

                                  KELLY
                  Not at all.  How about if Nicole and I
                  do it?  We're working as a team.

     Sam just looks at her.  She looks back -- big, pleading eyes.

                                  SAM
                  Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out
                  to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys
                  can wash the mud off.

                                  KELLY
                  Deal.
                         (beat)
                  You know, I just looked out front.  My
                  ride wasn't there.  You suppose you
                  could give me one?

     Sam doesn't answer right away.  He looks toward the school.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  You wouldn't want me to walk, would you?
                  I mean like, something bad might happen.

     Sam hesitates, momentarily at a loss, then turns to Jimmy, who
     seems to regard Kelly with something akin to physical pain.

                                  SAM
                  What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?

                                  JIMMY
                         (still looking at Kelly)
                  What?

                                  SAM
                  A ride.  You want one?

                                 JIMMY
                  Yeah.  But I got my bike.

     EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY

     Sam's Jeep rolls out of the drive, Jimmy's bike in back, meaning
     that Jimmy and Kelly are squeezed into the passenger seat, which
     is fine with Jimmy.  Kelly's thigh is pressed against his.  His
     arm pushes against her breast.  Kelly is not so happy.

     As they near the school's entrance, they come upon a beat-to-shit
     VW bug -- stalled at a stop sign.

     A John Deere tractor mower sits nearby.  A groundsman -- a tall
     black guy with a shaved head, waits at the wheel of the bug as...

     Suzie Toller -- in black platform shoes, a T-shirt and cutoff
     jeans, leans over the engine, fiddling with the car's linkage.

     Sam pulls up next to the bug and stops.

                                  SAM
                  We got room for one more, Suzie.  You
                  need a ride?

     Kelly rolls her eyes as Suzie turns to look at them.

                                  KELLY
                  Jesus.  Where'd she get those shoes?
                  Whores-4-Less?

     Suzie's eyes go cold.  She signals the groundsman, who turns the
     key.  The CAR SPLUTTERS to life.  Suzie flashes a smile, then
     sticks out her tongue -- which has been pierced by a silver stud.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  That's cute.

     Suzie gives her the finger.  Sam makes eye contact with Suzie,
     offers a sad smile, while putting the Jeep in gear.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                         (to Suzie)
                  I hope you swallow it.

     Jimmy turns, waving to Suzie as the Jeep pulls away.

     EXT. UPSCALE NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

     Magnificent old mansions occupy five-acre bay-front parcels amid
     lush, tropical settings.

     Sam's Jeep stops before a pair of gates with the words "VAN RYAN"
     woven into their wrought-iron design.  Beyond the gates a long
     drive leads toward a huge stone house.  Kelly jumps out, punches
     in a code.  The gates swing open.

                                  KELLY
                  Don't forget the car wash.

                                  SAM
                  I won't.

     SANDRA VAN RYAN, Kelly's mom, big, sexy, aggressive, a young 42
     in a string bikini, comes out from the side of the house.  When
     she sees the Jeep, she starts down the drive.

     Kelly waves to Sam, then walks up the drive.  When she sees her
     mother coming toward her, her face hardens.

                                  SANDRA
                  Is that Sam Lombardo?

                                  KELLY
                         (sarcastic)
                  Hi, Mon.

                                  SANDRA
                  Sam!  Hi!

     Sam has already hung a U.

     Sandra comes through the gate and up to the Jeep.

     Jimmy is checking her out.  All eyes.

                                  SANDRA (CONT'D)
                         (to Sam; as if Jimmy
                          wasn't even there)
                  What?  You're going to drive off without
                  even saying hi?

                                  SAM
                  Hi, Sandy.

                                  SANDRA
                  Why don't you come in, have a drink?

                                  SAM
                  Can't.  Got a passenger.

     Sandra looks down her nose at Jimmy.

                                  SANDRA
                  He can wait.

     Sam glances past her, to Kelly, who stands languidly at the front
     of the house, watching.

                                  SAM
                  I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run.

                                  SANDRA
                  I'll bet.
                         (then, softening)
                  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this
                  weekend.  We'll take the boat out...

                                  SAM
                         (cutting her off)
                  Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.

                                  SANDRA
                  What?  Running over alligators with that
                  silly swamp jalopy when you could be
                  sailing a real boat...

                                  SAM
                  Swamp's where it's at, Sandy.  Gives you
                  a look into the muck we all crawled out
                  of.  You ought to try it some time.

     Sandra gives him a hard stare, then marches off toward the house.

     CLOSE ON KELLY

     still at the door, a cold smile on her face.

                                                 FADE TO:

     EXT. SUBURBAN CUL-DE-SAC - DAY

     Neat little stucco houses -- some not so neat -- simmer in
     tropical heat.

     A BMW Z-3 Roadster stops at the head of the cul-de-sac.  Nicole
     is driving.  Kelly sits beside her.

                                  NICOLE
                  This is it?

     Kelly looks at a pad of paper, nods.

                                  KELLY
                  Four-thirty-seven.

     They pass a couple of teenagers playing basketball in a driveway,
     a guy mowing his yard.

                                  NICOLE
                  Nice.

                                  KELLY
                  What do you want, he's a teacher for
                  Christ's sake.
                         (beat)
                  It's here.  Pull over.

     Nicole does, before one of the not-so-neat houses.  Sam's muddy
     Jeep Wrangler is parked in the drive.  Behind that is a red
     Mercedes convertible.

     INT. SAM'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - SAME

     Sam and BARBARA, 28, a lean, beautiful country-clubber roll on
     the bed.  Barbara is dressed for tennis.  Sam wears a baggy pair
     of khaki shorts.  Barbara struggles to escape.  Sam grabs a leg,
     kisses the back of her knee.

     He pushes up the little white skirt, kissing her between her
     thighs.

                                  BARBARA
                         (getting just a little
                          breathless)
                  Sam, come on... I'm gonna be late for my
                  game...

     Sam keeps at it.  She's starting to weaken.

                                  BARBARA (CONT'D)
                  Not that I'm going to be much good after
                  last night...

                                  SAM
                  Eat a power bar.

     Barbara starts to giggle.  He's just about got her when...

     The DOORBELL RINGS.  Sam lets go.  Barbara sighs.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

     Sam goes to the front door, opens it, to find...

     Kelly and Nicole, holding plastic pails full of rags.  The girls
     are dressed in Blue Bay High T-shirts, cropped to REVEAL flat
     tummies, shorts and running shoes.

                                  GIRLS
                  Hi, Mr. Lombardo.

     Sam looks over the girls -- a small, exasperated smile.

                                  KELLY
                  Look, he forgot.  I knew it.

                                  SAM
                  No I didn't.  Check out the Jeep.  It's
                  nice and dirty for you.
                         (beat)
                  But you might want to wait a minute.
                  The Mercedes is leaving.

                                  NICOLE
                  You mean that isn't yours too?

     The girls giggle.  Sam smiles.

                                  KELLY
                  Where's the hose?  We can set up.

                                  SAM
                  In back of the garage.

     As they walk away, he is joined by Barbara.  She watches the
     girls with an appraising eye.

                                  BARBARA
                  Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid?

                                  SAM
                  Kelly.

                                  BARBARA
                  She's going to wash your Jeep?

                                  SAM
                  Senior class fund-raising gig.  I told
                  'em they could hose down the Jeep.
                         (off Barbara's look)
                  Hey, come on.  It's for a good cause.

     Barbara laughs at him.

                                  BARBARA
                  Sam the philanthropist.
                         (a beat)
                  Tomorrow, right?

     Sam nods.  Another kiss.

     EXT. SAM'S DRIVEWAY - SAME

     As Barbara goes to her car she sees the girls coming from behind
     the garage.  She looks at Sam, standing in his doorway, watching
     the girls.  When he sees Barbara looking at him, he shrugs, then
     waves.

     EXT. FRONT DOOR - SAM'S HOUSE - LATER

     Kelly and Nicole, looking very much like the finalists in a wet
     T-shirt derby, ring the bell.

     Sam answers.  He looks them over.  A couple of houses down he can
     see the guy with the mower, dumping grass into a can, watching
     the girls, then turning to walk back to his house.

                                  SAM
                  So, where you off to now?

                                  KELLY
                  Aren't  you forgetting something?
                          (off Sam's look)
                  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.

                                  SAM
                  Jeez, that thing... Can't you...

                                  KELLY
                         (smiling)
                  Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.

     Nicole laughs.

                                  SAM
                  All right.  I'll have to look for it.

                                  KELLY
                         (as he starts to go)
                  Mr. Lombardo.
                         (as he stops)
                  We're running kind of late.  How about
                  if Nicole goes on to the Mansons?  You
                  could give me a ride when you find the
                  ticket.

     Sam looks at her, as does Nicole.

                                  SAM
                  Give me a minute.

     He hurries from the room.  Kelly turns to Nicole, giving her the
     eye, pointing toward the drive.

                                  NICOLE
                         (mouthing the words)
                  Are you sure?

     Kelly nods, a mischievous smile on her face.

     INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - SAME

     Sam is rummaging through drawers.  He stops when he hears the
     SOUND of a CAR.  He goes to the window in time to see Nicole's
     BMW headed down his street.

     INT. SAM'S LIVING ROOM - SAME

     Sam ENTERS the room to find Kelly just inside the doorway, where
     the water from her wet clothing has formed little pools on the
     linoleum.

     Sam looks at the water.  He looks at Kelly.  She moves a step
     closer, allowing the door to SWING shut behind her.

     EXT. SAM'S NEIGHBORHOOD

     A long, slow, Antonioni PAN -- time passes -- the cul-de-sac --
     the sparkling lawns -- the kids with the basketball -- a jogger
     passing by...

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. SAM'S PORCH - LATER

     The front door.  The door opens.  Kelly comes out, fast, slamming
     the door behind her.  She walks down the drive.

     There are tears on her face.  As she hits the street, she begins
     to run.

     The man with the mower is now seated on his parch, drinking beer.
     He watches as the girl runs by.

     The teenagers are still playing hoops.  They stop as Kelly jogs
     past, sobbing.  They watch as she hits the end of the cul-de-sac
     and DISAPPEARS around a corner.

     EXT. THE EVERGLADES - DAY

     Sam, perched in the pilot's seat of a beat-to-shit old air boat,
     rips through the Florida swamp land.

     He glides across channels of water, then turns into the tall
     grass which whips at the hull of his boat.  Bits and pieces of
     debris fly through the air.  Sam smiles, swinging the boat
     through a series of wide, sliding turns.

     Suddenly he spots something.  He throttles down gliding into a
     shallow pool where... A HUGE ALLIGATOR, aware it has been found
     out, whips about, stirring up mud, then scuttling OUT OF SIGHT

                                  SAM
                  Sly old fucker.  How you got so big,
                  wasn't it?

     Sam sits for a moment in the silence.  He pulls a pair of
     binoculars from beneath his seat and looks through them.

     ANGLE ON HORIZON

     All we SEE is a shabby collection of whitewashed buildings
     shimmering in the last long light of afternoon.

     Sam watches for some time.  At last he lowers the binoculars,
     revs up his engine and leaves.

     ANGLE ON SAM'S BOAT

     as it moves away, as SEEN from water level where...

     The old gator has risen once more -- just the eyes -- a cold
     primordial intelligence, gazing out, unblinking across the murky
     waters of the swamp.

     EXT. SAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Sam's Wrangler pulls in next to Barbara's Mercedes.  The Jeep is
     muddy once more.  So is Sam.  He gets out.

     INT. SAM'S HOUSE - SAME

     Sam ENTERS.  The house is dark.

                                   SAM
                  Barbara?

     Nothing.  Me CROSSES the living room and starts down the hallway,
     where a faint light issues from beneath the bedroom door.

     INT. BEDROOM - SAME

     Sam opens the door.  He hears the SOUND of RUNNING WATER.  He
     walks across the room and into the bathroom.

     INT. BATHROOM - SAME

     Clouded mirrors, a shower stall full of. steam.  Behind the glass
     door we SEE an indistinct shape, moving about in the hot water.
     Sam opens the shower door.  The steam clears to REVEAL Barbara's
     gorgeous athletic body.

                                  BARBARA
                  It's hot in here, just the way you like
                  it.

     She grabs his shirt, pulling him into the shower's flow.  They
     kiss.  She pulls his shirt open, loosens his pants.  His clothes
     fall away.  Sam pushes her up against the tile wall, hard.  She
     holds to his shoulders, nails sinking into his flesh, wrapping
     her legs around his hips as...

     The water, dark with swamp mud, spirals down the drain.

     EXT. VAN RYAN ESTATE - NIGHT

     Kelly Van Ryan sits on the dock, looking back toward the huge
     stone house, where...

     A YELLOW LIGHT burns in one of the upstairs windows.

     Kelly has a shotgun laid across her knees.  Slowly, she raises
     the gun, pointing at the yellow window.

     She holds it there for some time, then, softly, to herself...

                                  KELLY
                  Bang...

     INT. MASTER BEDROOM - VAN RYAN ESTATE - NEXT DAY

     Sunlight streams through open windows, mingling with loud sighs
     of pleasure... Sandra Van Ryan on top of FRANKIE CONDO, a big,
     buffed-out Cuban.  They're making love on the bed.  She throws
     her head back -- an explosion of hair -- gasps -- an orgasm is
     near, as...

     A cordless PHONE RINGS on the night table.  They try to ignore
     it.  No dice.  Sandra groans, finally pulling away.

                                  SANDRA
                  Goddamnit!
                         (she answers)
                  Hello.

                                  COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)
                  Hello, this is the attendance office at
                  Blue Bay School.  Your son or daughter
                  is absent today, Monday...

                                  SANDRA
                  Jesus H. Christ!

     She hangs up hard.  Sits on the edge of the bed.

                                  FRANKIE
                  What?

     Sandra waves him off.  She pulls on a T-shirt, then grabs up the
     phone once more, punching in a number.

     INT. SAM'S OFFICE - BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY

     Desk, files, a terrarium full of swamp lizards, above which a
     photo of the Windward Passage decorates the wall.  There's a
     Waterford bowl on the desk -- etched with "Sam Lombardo -- Blue
     Bay Educator of the Year."

     Sam is working on the computer.  The PHONE RINGS.  He answers.

                                  SAM
                  Counseling.

     XNTERCUT - SANDRA/SAM PHONE CONVERSATION

     Sandra seated on the bed, one long leg tucked beneath her.

                                  SANDRA
                  Sam, Sandy Van Ryan.

     Frankie's eyes go cold when he hears the word "Sam."

     In his office, Sam pushes himself away from the computer,
     stiffening noticeably.

                                  SAM
                  Sandy... What's up?

                                  SANDRA
                  Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you
                  talked to her?

                                  SAM
                  No.

                                  SANDRA
                  Shit. Here we go again.

                                  SAM
                  Didn't you see her this morning?

                                  SANDRA
                  To tell you the truth, I haven't seen
                  her since Friday.

     BOOM -- A SHOTGUN BLASTS outside Sandra's window.  She jumps.
     BOOM, BOOM -- more BLASTS.  She jumps up to look outside.

     SANDRA'S POV - KELLY

     stands at the edge of the bay, launching skeet then blasting them
     high above the water.

     BACK TO SCENE

                                  SANDRA (CONT'D)
                  Never mind.  I found her.
                         (a long beat)
                  Listen, Sam.  It was good seeing you the
                  other day.
                         (beat)
                  I haven't found anyone else can handle
                  the Jonathan like you can.

     She glances at Frankie -- who has heard enough.  He gives her a
     long hard look, then rolls from the bed to walk from the room.

     Sam remains silent, watching the lizards with their blank,
     unblinking eyes.

                                  SANDRA (CONT'D)
                  Look.  I know you're seeing Barbara
                  Baxter.  So what?

                                  SAM
                  So maybe I'm a one-woman man.

     Sandra laughs.

                                  SANDRA
                  Right.
                         (beat)
                  You really think you're gonna get one of
                  these Blue Bay women to marry you?

     Sandra pauses to laugh once more.

                                  SANDRA (CONT'D)
                  Grab a clue, Sam.  You're a hired hand
                  around here.  Enjoy it while it lasts.

                                  SAM
                  Goodbye, Sandra.

     Sam puts down the phone, looks at it -- a long moment as -- the
     barest hint of a smile plays upon his face.

     Sandra slams down her phone.  She looks to the bay, to the sleek
     racing sloop floating beyond the private dock.

                                  SANDRA
                  The nerve of some people.

     EXT. VAN RYAN ESTATE - DAY

     The SHOTGUN BLASTS away.  Kelly pauses to reload.  She catches
     sight of...

     Sandra, approaching from the main house.

                                  SANDRA
                  You seem to find guns therapeutic.
                  Maybe I oughta try it.

     Kelly lets the gun's barrel drift over Sandra, then turns to walk
     away.  She moves toward the guest house.  A used-brick cottage
     tucked among the gnarled branches and roots of a huge banyan
     tree.  Sandra follows.

                                  SANDRA (CONT'D)
                  Let me guess, some boy didn't call and
                  screwed up the weekend.  So you're
                  taking the day off.

     Kelly looks toward the main house, in time to see...

     Frankie walk from the bedroom and dive into the pool.

                                  KELLY
                  Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?

                                  SANDRA
                  Whichever one I want.

     Kelly turns away, starts for the guest house once more.

     INT. GUEST HOUSE - DAY

     PAN to REVEAL room -- the gun case, the animal trophies, the
     photos -- One of a stately old gentleman in an elaborate wicker
     chair, a cane at his side, a bowler on his knee.  Others of Kelly
     and a handsome middle-aged man in safari gear, posing with their
     rifles above slain wildebeests and bison.

     Sandra and Kelly ENTER.  Kelly puts down the shotgun, turns,
     tears in her eyes.

                                  SANDRA
                  Okay, what's the matter?

                                  KELLY
                  You notice my new jumper?

     Kelly does a three-sixty, like a model on a runway.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  My friends buy me clothes, so I don't
                  look like trash.

                                  SANDRA
                  I would hardly say you look like trash.

                                  KELLY
                  No thanks to you.

     She sits on the bed.  Sandra moves to stand over her, angry now.

                                  SANDRA
                  Come off of it.
                         (a beat)
                  You run with all these little trust fund
                  brats... They think money grows on
                  trees.  It doesn't.  Believe me.  And a
                  lot of your little friends are gonna
                  learn that one the hard way.
                         (beat)
                  I'm trying to spare you that.

     Kelly goes to one shoulder on the bed, sobbing now.  Her mother
     continues to stand over her, suddenly more perplexed than angry.

                                  SANDRA (CONT'D)
                  Kelly.  What is it?

                                  KELLY
                  I miss Dad.

                                  SANDRA
                  Jesus.
                         (a long beat)
                  Well, I do too, sometimes...

                                  KELLY
                  No you don't.

                                  SANDRA
                  He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly.
                  He could have gone out and gotten a job.
                  Christ, he could've found another rich
                  woman... He never had a problem tucking
                  my friends when we were married.

     She pauses as Kelly cries all the harder.

                                  SANDRA (CONT'D)
                  I don't know why he did it.  I really
                  don't...

     Her voice trails away, as meanwhile Kelly has drawn herself up
     into a fetal position on the bed.  The sobbing has stopped but
     her shoulders continue to shake.  Sandra sits on the edge of the
     bed, reaches over to rub Kelly's back.

                                  SANDRA (CONT'D)
                  Can I get you anything?

     Kelly shakes her head, no.

     Her mother looks at her, clearly at a loss.  At last she stands.
     She is headed out of the room when Kelly says something, but the
     words are indistinct, as her fists are pressed against her mouth.

                                  SANDRA
                  What, honey?  I can't hear you.

     There is a long beat as Kelly collects herself.  She stares at
     the wall, her eyes filled with tears, but when she speaks she
     enunciates each word.

                                  KELLY
                  I said.  I was raped.

     Sandra looks as if she has been struck.

                                  SANDRA
                  What?

                                  KELLY
                  I was raped.
                         (a long beat)
                  By Sam Lombardo.

     Sandra moves over to the bed, sits once more.

                                  SANDRA
                  He... Sam Lombardo?

                                  KELLY
                  Yes.  God, Mom...

     Kelly begins to cry.  Sandra pulls her upright, cradling her in
     her arms, eyes on fire.

     EXT. BLUE BAY POLICE STATION - DAY

     An old Spanish-style building sits before a neat square of grass.

                                  SANDRA (V.O.)
                  My daughter does not get raped in Blue
                  Bay!

     INT. STATION HOUSE - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

     Sandra slams a fist on the conference table.

     Kelly is seated between her mother and her mother's attorney, TOM
     BAXTER.  Baxter sports an Italian suit and a lethal Alexander
     Haig look.

     Seated across from these three are Ray, Gloria and BRYCE HUNTER,
     the local D.A.

     Silence follows Sandra's outburst.  Baxter reaches to squeeze
     Sandra's shoulder.  Kelly puts her face in her hands.

                                  RAY
                         (in a quiet voice)
                  You're saying that Kelly was raped by
                  Sam Lombardo.

                                  SANDRA
                  That's right.

     Ray and Gloria exchange looks.  Gloria in particular looks
     slightly stunned.

                                  GLORIA
                  The guidance counselor at Blue Bay?

                                  SANDRA
                         (sarcastically)
                  The guidance counselor at Blue Bay.

                                  GLORIA
                  We understand your feelings, Ms. Van
                  Ryan.  But please, we'd like some time
                  with Kelly.  We'd like to take her
                  statement alone.

     Baxter nods, yes.  Sandra looks at Kelly.

                                  SANDRA
                  Are you okay for this?

     Kelly nods.

                                  SANDRA (CONT'D)
                  The man must be insane to think he can
                  do this to me...

     Tom Baxter takes her by the arm as Ray CROSSES the room to open
     the door.  Bryce Hunter walks out with then.

     Gloria takes a seat closer to Kelly.  When she speaks, she is
     very calm and quiet.

                                  GLORIA
                  How are you, Kelly? Would you like to
                  take a break for a minute?

                                  KELLY
                         (shaking her head)
                  I just want to get it over with.  My
                  mom's making me do this. I just want to
                  forget it.

                                  GLORIA
                  I know you do.

     She waits as Ray sets up a camera on a tripod.

                                  GLORIA (CCNT'D)
                  We'd like to videotape the statement if
                  that's all right with you.

     Kelly shrugs.

                                  GLORIA (CONT'D)
                  I know this is not pleasant, Kelly.  But
                  these are serious charges and we need to
                  know everything that happened between
                  you and Mr. Lombardo.
                         (beat)
                  Are you ready?

     Kelly nods.

     CLOSE ON VIDEO MONITOR - KELLY'S STATEMENT

                                  KELLY
                  He started rubbing my shoulders.  Said
                  must be sore after washing cars.  I...
                  let him  I mean he's a nice guy.
                         (beat)
                  I don't know... It was so fast.  I
                  closed my eyes.  I remember his hands
                  moved to my breasts.  I mean just for a
                  second it was nice... I forgot whore I
                  was.  I mean he's so gorgeous...

     PULL BACK to REVEAL...

     INT. STATION HOUSE - DAY

     Ray, Gloria and Bryce Hunter stand at one end of the long
     conference table, watching the playback of Kelly's tape.

     BACK TO VIDEOTAPE

                                  KELLY
                  The next thing... his hand was in my
                  shorts... you know, from behind.  His
                  fingers... his fingers...

                                  GLORIA (O.S.)
                  Take your time.

                                  KELLY
                  They were in me.  Both places... you
                  know.

                                  GLORIA (O.S.)
                  I understand.

                                  KELLY
                  He said something like, "Do you want it
                  dirty7" or something.
                         (beat)
                  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me
                  to the floor.

                                  GLORIA (O.S.)
                  Was there penetration?  Did he put
                  himself inside you?

                                  KELLY
                  Yes.  I said stop.  I screamed.  I mean
                  that's how it sounded in my head.  He
                  hurt me...

                                  GLORIA (O.S.)
                         (as Kelly breaks into
                          tears)
                  That's okay, Kelly.  You're doing fine.
                         (beat)
                  But I have to ask you something here.
                  When you say it hurt.  Was this the
                  first time a man was inside you?

                                  KELLY
                  No.  I've done it a couple of times, I
                  mean with guys I dated.  But this
                  hurt... like, he was built... you
                  know...

                                  GLORIA (O.S.)
                  He was large?


     Kelly nods, starts to break down again, then holds it off.

                                  GLORIA (O.S., CONT'D)
                  Did you try to fight him?

                                  KELLY
                  I... he had my wrists pinned behind me.
                  I remember my hands were cold.'

                                  GLORIA (O.S.)
                  Then what?

                                  KELLY
                  He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it
                  happen."  Then he just stopped.

                                  GLORIA (O.S.)
                  You mean he withdrew...

                                  KELLY
                  Not at first.  He was still inside but
                  he wasn't moving or anything...  He said
                  we had this secret.  And that now he'd
                  be able to help me... because we were
                  close... Something like that.  I don't
                  know.  It's hard to remember, exactly.

                                  GLORIA (O.S.)
                  Try, Kelly.

                                  KELLY
                  I know one thing he said.  It was
                  when... when he took himself out and was
                  standing up.
                         (beat)
                  He said, "Don't worry, I didn't come."
                  I can't forget that.  He said, "No
                  little girl can ever make me come."

     The tape is paused -- FREEZES on Kelly's face ON SCREEN.

     BACK TO RAY, GLORIA & HUNTER

                                  HUNTER
                  "No little girl can ever make me come."
                  Jesus.  Too bad.  We might have some
                  physical evidence.

     Ray and Gloria stare at the screen.

                                  GLORIA
                  I don't know.  It feels wrong.

     Ray and Hunter look at her.

                                  HUNTER
                  Why?

                                  GLORIA
                  I think she's acting.  I think she set
                  it up to be alone with him because she
                  wanted him to come on to her.
                         (beat)
                  I think maybe she's upset that he
                  didn't...

                                  RAY
                  Or maybe she thought that was what she
                  wanted and she got a little more than
                  she bargained for...

                                  HUNTER
                  The line I get on this guy, is that he's
                  done half the women in Blue Bay.

                                  GLORIA
                  That doesn't make him a child rapist.
                         (beat)
                  There's something else.  This girl's had
                  some problems.  Wrecked a couple of her
                  mom's cars.  Ran away...

                                  HUNTER
                  Where's this coming from?

                                  GLORIA
                  I worked Juvenile in Dade County for
                  three years.  We had a missing persons
                  on Kelly Van Ryan for two weeks... Maybe
                  a year ago... The family kept it out of
                  the papers.

                                  RAY
                  That would make it about the time of her
                  old man's suicide.  You don't think that
                  could explain some erratic behavior?

                                  GLORIA
                  All I'm saying is, I think we should go
                  slow here.

     Hunter puts his hands together, thinking.  He looks from Ray to
     Gloria, than back to Ray.

                                  HUNTER
                  I want a full-scale investigation.

                                  GLORIA
                  You know what that will mean for
                  Lombardo.

                                  HUNTER
                  I don't care.  You heard that girl's
                  statement.  I think he's dirty.  Get me
                  a case.

     Gloria and Ray watch as Hunter gets up and leaves the room.

                                  GLORIA
                  Well you were a big help.  You know
                  what's going to happen if we go
                  full-bore on this.

     Ray looks at the screen.

                                  RAY
                  It's our job, Gloria.

                                  GLORIA
                  Hunter's making it our job because
                  Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass.
                  You know that as well as I do.
                         (beat)
                  We're gonna trash this guy's life and I
                  keep asking myself if it's really
                  necessary.

     Ray thinks this over.  He continues to study the screen.

     CLOSE ON SCREEN - KELLY'S FACE

                                  RAY (0.S.)
                  Yeah, well, maybe you're wrong about
                  him.  Maybe he's got it coming.

     BEGIN MONTAGE - INVESTIGATION

     EXT. CUL-DE-SAC - DAY

     Ray takes notes, talks with neighbors, kids, lawn mower man.

     EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DRIVEWAY - DAY

     Gloria talks with students -- Jimmy, Nicole, others.

     INT. SAM'S OFFICE - DAY

     Sam sits at his desk, toying with a pencil.  He watches students
     pass -- no smiles, no waves, an occasional dark look.

     Through the press of students Sam sees Art at the door of his
     office.  The two men look at one another.  At which point...

     Gloria, followed by Ray, steps INTO SCENE.  The detectives shake
     hands with Art.  As Art turns to close the door, Sam falls within
     his line of vision.  Art looks away.  The door swings shut.

     EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL DOCKS - LATER

     The sky has begun to color.  Art Maddox stands on the grass at
     the end of the channel separating the slips, watching as...

     A lone sailboat tacks toward the school.

     ANGLE ON BOAT - SAM & JIMMY

     Sam drops his sail, leaving himself just enough momentum to
     cruise expertly into the little channel then into the slip.

     Art watches as Jimmy jumps from the boat, ties it off.

                                  SAM
                  That's good, Jimbo.  I'll see you on
                  Monday.

     Jimmy hesitates, he wants to say something.  Sam waves him off.
     Jimmy gives Art a hard look and heads for the grass.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                         (to Art, nodding after
                          Jimmy)
                  What's left of my sailing class.

     Art studies the dock between his feet.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  Talk to me Artie.

                                  ART
                  Kelly Van Ryan...

                                  SAM
                  ... is accusing me of rape.  Jimmy told
                  me.  Apparently I'm the last to know...

                                  ART
                  Sam... I...
                         (a long beat)
                  Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with
                  every member of the school board all day
                  long.  She's pushing for suspension...

                                  SAM
                  This is insane.

     Art shakes his head.

                                  ART
                  All I can tell you Sam, is hang in
                  there.  They clear you of this mess, you
                  get reinstated, with back pay...

                                  SAM
                  That's great.  I'll just tell my
                  creditors I'm not a rapist.  No
                  problem... Shit.
                         (beat)
                  I can't believe the board's going to act
                  without even hearing my side of it.

                                  ART
                  The Van Ryan family created Blue Bay.
                  They built the school... Sandra Van Ryan
                  calls up the board and says kiss my ass,
                  they say, left, right, or in the middle.
                         (beat)
                  You're gonna need some help on this one,
                  Sam.  You're gonna need a lawyer, and
                  he'd better be a good one.

     EXT. STRIP MALL - DAY

     Typical of its kind -- a Blockbuster Video, a 7-Eleven, half a
     dozen small businesses, one of which, sandwiched between a donut
     shop and the Mongolian Beef Bowl, bears the sign:  "KEN BOWDEN --
     ATTORNEY AT LAW."

     INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

     Sam sits in a cramped waiting room, leafing through a magazine.

     An attractive young SECRETARY sits a few feet away, behind her
     desk.  Her PHONE RINGS.  She picks it up, then turns to Sam,
     favoring him with a flirtatious smile.

                                  SECRETARY
                  Mr. Bowden will see you now.

     INT. OFFICE - DAY

     Ken Bowden, a slightly oily-looking young man in a nice suit and
     a large, padded neck brace, rises to shake Sam's hand.

                                  KEN
                  Sam, hey, it's been a while.
                         (beat)
                  Looked for you at the ten year reunion.
                  You missed out.  Three days at the
                  Disneyworld Hotel... Partied ourselves
                  silly.

     Sam nods.

                                  KEN (CONT'D)
                  Couple of your old flames were there.
                  You remember Jill, with the knockers.

     Ken holds his hands out in front of his chest.

                                  KEN (CONT'D)
                  Blew up like the Goodyear blimp.

     Sam forces a smile.

                                  KEN (CONT'D)
                  But check this...

                                  SAM
                         (interrupting)
                  Ken.  I'm in some trouble.  I need an
                  attorney and you're the only one I know.
                  So I figured I'd start here.

     Ken stops, puts on a serious face.

                                  KEN
                  Well, I'm glad you did.  And I'm sorry.
                         (folding his hands before
                          him)
                  Why don't you tell me about it.

     Sam looks at him.  He starts to speak, then checks himself.

                                  SAM
                  What did you do to your neck?

     Ken puts a hand to his throat, as if aware of the brace for the
     first time.

                                  KEN
                  Oh this... chiropractor did a number on
                  me.

     He takes the brace off, tossing it on his desk.

                                  KEN (CONT'D)
                  I don't really have to wear the thing
                  all the time.
                         (beat)
                 A guy from the insurance was here.

     Ken smiles.  Sam looks slightly ill.

                                  KEN (CONT'D)
                  Go ahead, Sam.  Shoot.  Let's see what
                  we've got here.

     EXT. A BLUE HAY RESTAURANT - NIGHT

     Trendy nouveau.  A valet parks Sam's Jeep.

     INT. RESTAURLNT - SAME

     Sam walks across a tiled entry.  He looks tired, but smiles at
     the maitre d'.

                                  SAM
                  Georgie, hey.  I'm meeting Barbara.  She
                  here yet?

     GEORGE looks stiff, maybe a little nervous.  Sam picks up on it.
     He scans the room...

     ANGLE ON ROOM

     Dimly-lit, crowded, but we PICK OUT Barbara, stunning in a
     delicate white sun dress, tanned arms resting upon a table.

     Sam starts toward her.  George reaches out to touch his arm.

                                  GEORGE
                  Mr. Lombardo.

     Sam ignores him, threading his way among the people at a lavish
     bar, then stopping short as he sees who Barbara is with -- her
     father, Tom Baxter.

     Tom Baxter sees Sam, gets to his feet.

                                  BAXTER
                  This is not appropriate Lombardo.

     Sam steps to one side, makes eye contact with Barbara.

     Barbara has tears in her eyes.  She looks at Sam, then shakes her
     head, looking away.

                                  SAM
                  Barbara...

                                  BAZTER
                  You're finished in Blue Bay, Lombardo.
                  You've been scratching at the door long
                  enough...
                         (as Sam faces him)
                  I ever see you around my daughter,
                  you're going to be finished, period.

     The two men square off, but already we can SEE Georgie, trailed
     by a pair of beefy characters in blue blazers making their way
     across the room.

     Sam sees them too.  He takes a final look at Barbara.  When she
     refuses to meet his eye, he pushes past Baxter, through the crowd
     and out of the restaurant.

     EXT. AN EVERGLADES ROADHOUSE - NIGHT

     Red neon identifies it as Jim's Recovery Room.  A handful of
     trucks sit in a dirt parking lot, Sam's Jeep among them.

     INT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT

     The air is thick with smoke.  Locals shoot pool.  The walls are
     decorated with dusty fishing nets and inflated blowfish.

     An aging BARMAID -- good-looking -- once, runs a rag around a
     pitcher, looks down the bar, smiles, finding...

     Sam, alone, awaiting service.

                                  BARMAID
                  Sam, honey... Haven't seen you in a
                  while.  How's life treatin' you?
                         (off Sam's look)
                  That bad, huh?  Well, you came to the
                  right place.

     EXT. ROADHOUSE - LATER

     Sam walks outside.  He stands in the red glow of neon light,
     looking toward the road... On the opposite side of which...

     ... sits a sorry little collection of whitewashed stucco
     bungalows, identified by a green neon sign as the Glades Motel.

     Beyond the motel are the Everglades, a great expanse of darkness.

     Sam stares at the motel.  At last he gets in his Jeep.  As he
     EXITS the lot, a second pair of headlights flashes on.

     EXT. EVERGLADES - NIGHT

     A deserted two-lane road cuts through the swamp.  Trees bearded
     with moss appear as ghostly shapes in the lights of Sam's Jeep.

     INT./EXT. SAM'S JEEP - MOVING - SAME

     San drives -- a tired face.  Soft MUSIC on the RADIO.

     Something APPEARS in the road, caught for a moment in the
     headlights.  Sam swerves, whirls his head around, sees...

     A GATOR sliding of the shoulder and into the murky water.

     Sam lets out some air, relaxing a bit, then catches sight of
     something else -- Headlights finding reflection in his rearview
     mirror, coming fast.  Sam watches as the lights get closer.  He
     looks back to the road -- an approaching curve...

     Sam is into the curve when the lights catch him.  A black Range
     Rover moves out to pass, then turns suddenly into Sam's lane,
     cutting him off.

     It happens quickly.  Sam swerves to avoid hitting the larger car,
     but the road affords little margin for error.

     The JEEP slides across a narrow shoulder, then plummets down a
     steep embankment, CRASHING through cattails, rolling over to SLAM
     BACK DOWN on its tires in a swampy gulch.

     Sam slumps back from the steering wheel.  Somewhere over his head
     he can see headlights shining into the trees.

     He hears a CAR DOOR SLAM, the SOUNDS of someone scrambling down
     the embankment.

     Sam tries to get out of his seat harness.  Someone is
     approaching, splashing through the muck.  Suddenly a hand reaches
     through the broken driver's window, helping him.

                                  MAN'S VOICE
                  Are you all right?

     The hands get him loose.  Sam stumbles from the car.

                                  SAM
                  Yeah, I'm okay.

     He looks up to find -- Frankie Condo, looming over him.

                                  FRANKIE
                  That's too bad.

     He grabs Sam, pulling him OUT OF FRAME.  What we are left with is
     the SOUND of FISTS THUDDING INTO FLESH -- then Sam, hitting the
     hood of his Jeep, slumping down into the muck.

     Frankie is breathing hard.  We HEAR him SLOGGING back up the
     embankment.  We HEAR a DOOR SLAM, the RANGE ROVER driving away,
     leaving only darkness, and the EERIE SOUNDS of the swamp.

     EXT. THE STRIP MALL - DAY

     Dazzling light.  Sam's smashed-up Jeep is parked before Ken
     Bowden's office, next door to the Mongolian Beef Bowl.

     INT. BEEF BOWL - SAME

     Sam and Ken eye one another over a green plastic table -- Ken
     with his neck brace, Sam with a bruised face.

                                  KEN
                  I figured, you know, it would be darker
                  in here.

     He moves a hand to his face.

                                  SAM
                  Good thinking.

                                  KEN
                  You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van
                  Ryan...

                                  SAM
                  Forget it.

                                  KEN
                  Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all
                  I'm saying.

                                  SAM
                  I know how deep her pockets are, Ken.  I
                  thought I might be able to save my
                  fucking house with an equity loan.
                  Guess who's on the board of directors at
                  the bank?

     He pauses to look at Ken Bowden.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  Can't you take that stupid thing off?

                                  KEN
                  Not in here.  Chiropractor comes in here
                  for lunch sometimes.

     San sighs, slumps back in his plastic seat.

                                  KEN (CONT'D)
                  You're not in bad shape, really.  I know
                  you think you are, but you're not.  Let
                  me tell you why.
                         (beat)
                  Sandra Van Ryan.

                                  SAM
                  What's that supposed to mean?

                                  KEN
                  For you to be getting this kind of heat,
                  for what they have on you... It doesn't
                  add up.  Sandra Van Ryan's got 'em
                  running scared.
                         (beat)
                  And I'll tell you something else, you
                  rush, you get careless.

     Ken reaches into his briefcase.  He pulls out some papers, tosses
     them on the table.  Sam picks one up, starts to read.

                                  SAM
                  Nellie Gail Ranch...

                                  KEN
                  Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab
                  farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went
                  when her morn fished her out of the
                  swamp.
                         (beat)
                  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year
                  I mean there's no way they can put
                  this thing in front of a jury.
                         (beat)
                  Shit, they haven't even taken your
                  statement yet.  Reason?  They're still
                  shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're
                  coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.

                                  SAM
                  There's nothing for them to get.

                                  KEN
                  Good.  So what we're going to do is
                  march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're
                  going to insist they take a statement.
                  We're going to tell them to charge your
                  ass or get off your back.
                         (beat)
                  They're walking a fine line here.
                  Defamation of character, malicious
                  prosecution...

                                  SAM
                  I just want my life back...

                                  KEN
                  Fair enough.  Let's go make a statement.

     INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

     Everyone's looking a little tired, with the possible exception of
     Ray.  At this moment he sits back in his chair, staring at Sam.

                                  RAY
                  Why don't you tell us one more time, how
                  Kelly came to be with you, alone in your
                  house.

                                  SAM
                         (with growing impatience)
                  Story's the same, Detective...

     Ken pats him on the arm.  When Sam speaks again, it is in a
     calmer voice, calm but tired.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  I had to go look for this coupon.

                                  RAY
                  The one you bought at school.

                                  SAM
                         (nodding)
                  Like I said, I hadn't really expected to
                  use it.
                         (beat)
                  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I
                  hear a car.  I look out the window.  I
                  see Nicole driving away.  I leave my
                  room, and there's Kelly.

                                  RAY
                  In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.

                                  SAM
                  Yes.

                                  RAY
                  And she wanted to talk.

                                  SAM
                  Yes.

                                  RAY
                  But you can't tell us what she wanted to
                  talk about.

                                  SAM
                  I could, but it's confidential.  Look,
                  the point is, we didn't talk.  I told
                  her this was not an appropriate time or
                  place.

                                  RAY
                  And she began to cry.  And you put an
                  arm around her.

                                  SAM
                  Yes.  Mainly to turn her toward the
                  door.  I told her we would talk on
                  Monday, in the office.

                                  GLORIA
                  And when you turned her toward the door,
                  where did you expect her to go, without
                  a car?

                                  SAM
                  Again.  I think we covered this.  I told
                  her I was going to call a cab.

                                  RAY
                  But she ran away.

                                  SAM
                  That's right.

                                  GLORIA
                  Did you call anyone?  Did you call her
                  house to see if she got home?  Did you
                  call the Masons?

                                  SAM
                  No.

                                  GLORIA
                  Weren't you a little worried about
                  her...?

                                  SAM
                  There's a strip mall not half a mile
                  from my house.  There's phones there.  I
                  cruised the place, but I didn't see her.
                  I figured she was probably there but
                  that she was angry and didn't want to be
                  found.  I don't know... Maybe I should
                  have called.  But it's not like Kelly
                  can't take care of herself.  I figured
                  we'd just take it up on Monday, in the
                  office.

     There is a moment of silence in the room.

                                  RAY
                  But you do admit to touching her, to
                  putting your arm around her.  Isn't that
                  against the rules?

                                  SAM
                  It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...
                         (beat)
                  But, I mean... there's this kid standing
                  in front of you crying...

                                  RAY
                  With a thirty-five inch bustline in a
                  wet T-shirt with no bra...

     He is cut short as Sam shoves his chair back from the table.

                                  SAM
                  Fuck you.  This is bullshit.  I'm outta
                  here.

                                  RAY
                  Sit down, Lombardo.

     Sam and Ray stare at one another.  Ken puts a hand on his
     client's arm.

                                  KEN
                  All right, all right... Enough.

     Ken stands up.  He walks to the two-way mirror set in one wall,
     rapping on the glass with his knuckles.

                                  KEN (CONT'D)
                  We came down here to make a statement.
                  We've made it.
                         (beat)
                  If you're going to charge my client, do
                  it now.

     INT. OPPOSITE SIDE MIRROR ROOM - HUNTER

     stares at Ken's face, about a foot away.  Ken of course can't see
     him.  Hunter gives him the finger.

     INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - KEN

     stares into the mirror, waiting.

                                  KEN
                  I didn't think so.
                         (to Sam)
                  Let's go.

     Ken opens the door.  Sam turns back to Ray and Gloria.

                                  SAM
                  I've spent the last ten years of my life
                  working with kids.  I love what I do,
                  and I think I'm good at it.
                         (beat)
                  These kids trust me, and there is no
                  way.  No way in hell I would ever betray
                  that trust.

     As Ken and Sam leave, Ray and Gloria are joined by Bryce Hunter.

                                  HUNTER
                  Nice speech.  Either of you buying?

     Ray shrugs.

                                  RAY
                  Not that stuff about her running away,
                  him trying to find her.  That's
                  bullshit.

                                  HUNTER
                  What about witnesses?

                                  RAY
                  We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard,
                  couple of kids playing hoops.

                                  HUNTER
                  And what do they say?

                                  GLORIA
                  Same as him.  They saw her come.  They
                  saw her go.  They saw him follow.

                                  RAY
                  Still doesn't explain why he couldn't
                  catch up with her.  I mean how long does
                  it take to put on a shirt?

     At which point, a COP APPEARS in the doorway.

                                  COP
                  Phone, Bryce.  It's Sandra Van Ryan.

                                  HUNTER
                  Christ Almighty.  That woman's calling
                  me six times a day.

     He starts away, then stops.

                                  HUNTER (CONT'D)
                  I think you're onto something, Ray.
                  Stay with it.

     Hunter bangs out of the room.  Gloria slumps in a chair, tired,
     disgusted.

                                  GLORIA
                  We failed to mention the mower guy's a
                  drunk, that he was after more beer and
                  never really saw Kelly go into the
                  house, so he can't say how long she was
                  in there.  Same with the kids.  They saw
                  her running down the street, but that's
                  it.
                         (beat)
                  With no physical evidence, what do we
                  have?  Her word against his.

                                  RAY
                  You're telling me you believe the guy?

                                  GLORIA
                  All I'm saying is, we let Sandra Van
                  Ryan push us too hard, we're going to
                  wind up looking stupid.

     Ray is paged by his BEEPER.  He pulls it off his belt, looks at
     the number.

                                  RAY
                  I'd better return this.

     Ray leaves.  Gloria pulls a cigarette from her purse and lights
     up, rests her head back in the chair, blowing smoke at the
     ceiling.

     INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - LATER

     Gloria is grinding out the butt as Ray walks back in.  There is
     something in the way he carries himself, some sense of urgency.

                                  RAY
                         (off Gloria's look)
                  Seen any good gator wrestling lately?

     EXT./INT. DETECTIVES' CAR - MOVING - DAY

     Ray and Gloria drive through the Everglades, past marshlands
     punctuated by thick stands of melaluca trees.

                                  GLORIA
                  They say it was old man Van Ryan planted
                  the melalucas to dry up the swamp.

     Ray nods.

                                  GLORIA (CONT'D)
                  You can go up to one of those trees and
                  peel the bark.  You know what you get?
                  More bark.  And more bark.  There's no
                  core.  Tree's not good tar anything but
                  sucking up water.  And now they can't
                  get rid of them.  They've tried poisons.
                  Nothing works.  They don't die.

                                  RAY
                  Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his.  I don't
                  imagine he gives a shit now.

     Gloria just looks at him.  Ray stares into the dusty light of an
     approaching sunset.  At last he slows, turning off the highway
     and onto a narrow dirt road.

     A sign pokes out from the tall grass -- "SMILIN' JACK'S FISH
     CAMP."

     The Taurus bounces along the washboard road.

     They are driving now at the edge of a canal.

                                  RAY
                  You remember that little girl walked out
                  of our talk at Blue Bay?

                         (beat)
                  Beats the shit out of me why she would
                  call me at all.  I busted her once for

                  six months at Camp Nine.

                                  GLORIA
                  You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.

     Ray gives her a look.  Gloria shrugs.

                                  GLORIA (CONT'D)
                  That's what they called it when I was in
                  Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place.

                                  RAY
                  It's a shithole.  But she was dirty,
                  what was I gonna do?

     They pass a sagging chain-link fence, entering a quarter-mile run
     of shabby trailers and cheap shacks.

     The squalor of the buildings is seat in contrast to the beauty of
     the Glades where the waters have gone to the color of polished
     brass beneath an immense, darkening sky.

     Ray parks before a ramshackle building covered in vines and
     peeling paint.  A sign reads:  "NIGHT CRAWLERS $1 A BUCKET."  The
     jawbones of numerous gators hang beneath the eaves.

     As they get out of the car, something catches Gloria's eye --
     along the bank of the canal...

     ANGLE ON BANK

     where a tall man (WALTER) with long white hair and tattooed arms
     kneels inside a pen, slapping a huge gator on its snout.  The
     reptile lifts its upper body, hissing, opening its jaws.

     Walter takes a stick from his hip pocket, passing it through the
     gator's mouth.  The jaws snap shut, incredibly fast, with a
     hollow snapping sound.

     Gloria jumps instinctively, then watches, aghast, as Walter slaps
     the creature once more.  This time moving round to the front of
     the gator, sticking halt his arm inside its mouth.

                                  VOICE (0.5.)
                  He's just showin' off for you now.

     Gloria starts, then turns to find a woman (RUBY) has walked up
     beside her.  The woman is in her sixties.  She's dressed in
     polyester.  Her hair is piled on top of her head -- too dark to
     be anything but a dye job.  A cigarette bobs from her lips.

     Before Gloria can respond, Ray steps up behind than.

                                  RAY
                  Evening Ruby.
                         (beat)
                  I see you still got Walter.  I was sort
                  of hoping something had eaten him by

                  Can I help you with something?

     Ray and the old lady look at each other.

                                  RAY
                  Suzie called.  You know where we can
                  find her?

     Ruby looks toward the store.

                  You know the way.

     She watches as the detectives CROSS the road, then calls to them
     as they start up the steps.

                                  RUBY (CONT'D)
                  You won't shoot her will you?  I don't
                  believe she's armed.

     Gloria turns, surprised.  Ray gives the woman a long, cold stare,
     then opens the door for Gloria.

     INT. CAMP STORE - SAME

     It's dark inside.  The main light source is a tiny, beat-up
     black-and-white TV.

     Two elderly women in colored bouffant hairdos sit on a ratty old
     couch watching reruns of "Family Feud."  They look up as Ray and
     Gloria ENTER then EXIT through a door in the back.

     INT. SUZIE'S ROOM - SAME

     Black walls.  Cheap bookshelves, filled to overflowing.  A wire
     strung with dismembered doll parts runs the length of the room.

     Suzie is propped on a ratty futon, an open book on her stomach,
     her thin, white arms crossed behind her head.

                                  SUZIE
                  Jesus.  It took you long enough.  What
                  if somebody was trying to strangle me?
                  Or fuck me in the ass, even?
                         (beat)
                  I mean, you guys are Sex Crimes.

     Ray manages a thin smile.

                                  RAY
                  Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.

                                  SUZIE
                  I did.  At Blue Balls.

                                  GLORIA
                  Seems to me you left early, before we
                  could meet.  But hi, Suzie.

     Gloria puts out a hand.  Suzie looks at it, puts out a hand of
     her own.

     As the women shake, Gloria looks at the book on Suzie's stomach,
     turning her head as if to read the title.

                                  SUZIE
                  It's Celine.  He's okay.  He had a
                  pretty good line on what cheap fucks
                  people are.

                                  RAY
                  So Suzie, you called us, remember?

     Suzie takes a cigarette from a pack at her side, lights up, blows
     smoke at the ceiling.

                                  SUZIE
                  Did they arrest Mr. Lombardo?

     Ray and Gloria exchange looks.

                                  RAY
                  No.

                                  SUZIE
                  Will they?

                                  RAY
                  It doesn't look like it.

                                  SUZIE
                  Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?

     Ray shrugs.

                                  GLORIA
                  That bothers you?

                                  SUZIE
                         (a long beat)
                  Yeah, maybe, a little.

                                  GLORIA
                  Why is that?

     Suzie lets out her breath.  She rests her head against the wall.

                                  GLORIA (CONT'D)
                  You can talk to us, Suzie.  That's why
                  we're here...

     INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

     Suzie, Gloria and Hunter sit at the conference table.  Ray
     operates the video cam.

                                  GLORIA
                  Okay, Suzie.  We want you to tell us
                  about the day Mr. Lombardo gave you and
                  Jimmy a ride.

       Suzie stares at the three cops around her, then at the camera.

                                  SUZIE
                  You didn't tell me you were gonna put me
                  on the fucking news.

                                  GLORIA
                  We need to tape the interview, Suzie.
                  No one will see it but us.
                         (beat)
                  Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo
                  gave you the ride?

     Suzie stares at the camera.  She's lost the cockiness she had on
     her own turf.  She looks small, white and frail in the sterile
     room, surrounded by the detectives.

                                  SUZIE
                  About a year ago.

                                  GLORIA
                  He dropped Jimmy off first?

                                  SUZIE
                  Yeah.

                                  GLORIA
                  And when he arrived at your house, was
                  anyone there?

                                  SUZIE
                  No.

                                  GLORIA
                  So you were alone.

                                  SUZIE
                  Yes.

                                  GLORIA
                  Did he come in with you?

                                  SUZIE
                  I guess.

                                  HUNTER
                  You guess?  Did he or didn't he?

                                  SUZIE
                  Yeah... okay... he did

                                  HUNTER
                  And then what... he touched you?  Did
                  you maybe flirt a little...

                                  SUZIE
                  I wanna go home now.

     Gloria glares at Hunter, shakes her head.

                                  GLORIA
                  Suzie, look, I know you feel bad.  I
                  know it's harder to talk here than in
                  your room, but we need to get it on
                  tape.
                         (beat)
                  Just tell us what you told us before.
                  Tell us the truth.

     Suzie huddles in her skinny arms, studying the detectives.

                                  SUZIE
                  I didn't say a thing to him.  He just
                  put his arm around me.  Told me I was
                  pretty... I could be really pretty, he
                  said.

   Another moment -- she looks at Ray, then at Hunter.

                                  HUNTER
                  What did you do then?

                                  SUZIE
                         (a long beat)
                  Shit, what difference does it make...
                  Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...

                                  HUNTER
                  Suzie!  Did this man rape you?

                                  SUZIE
                  Okay!  He did.  He pushed me to the
                  floor and he did it to me.  Now, can I
                  go home?

     She stands up.

                                  GLORIA
                  At that point were you able to fight him
                  off?

                                  SUZIE
                  No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay?
                  That's all.  Let me go.

     Gloria gets to her feet as well; she tries to put an arm around
     Suzie.  The girl jumps back as if she has been shocked.

                                  SUZIE (CONT'D)
                  Don't touch me.

     Gloria's hands fall to her sides.

     Suzie heads for the door.


     The detectives exchange looks.
         
     At which point, Suzie stops, turns to face the room.

                                  SUZIE (CONT'D)
                  He did say something.

                                  GLORIA
                  What was that?

                                  SUZIE
                  He said, "No little bitch can ever make
                  me come."

     IN THE COURTROOM

     Kelly Van Ryan sits in the witness box, dabbing her eyes with a
     handkerchief while Bryce Hunter stands before her.  The room is
     silent, the spectators riveted on the scene.

                                  HUNTER
                  Do you need more time?

     Kelly shakes her head, no.

                                  HUNTER (CONT'D)
                  I know this is hard, Kelly, but I have
                  just one more question and even though
                  its something we've been over, I want us
                  all to be very clear about it.

     Ray and Gloria watch her, exchange glances.  Gloria picks up
     Suzie's cigarette for her, puts it out in an ashtray.

     PANNING the spectators, we SEE Sandra, Baxter, Ray, Gloria.

     Hunter is on the witness stand.

     Suzie is in the box.  She looks pale, even more nervous.

                                  SUZIE
                  He pushed into me... I couldn't stop
                  him... it hurt.

                                  HUNTER
                  I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?

                                  SUZIE
                  Because... it was the biggest I've ever
                  seen.  And I've seen a lot on their way
                  through Jack's Fish Camp.

     Chuckling in the courtroom.  The JUDGE glares, silencing it.

                                  HUNTER
                  Ms. Toller, did Samuel Lombardo rape you
                  in your family's home on the 23rd of
                  April last year?

     Suzie glances at Sam, hesitates.

                                  HUNTER (CONT'D)
                  Ms. Toller?

                                  SUZIE
                  I said he did.

                                  HUNTER
                  Ms. Toller.  I'm asking you now, under
                  oath, did Samuel Lonbardo rape you?

     Suzie looks around, as if for help.  The spectators stir.
     Ray rubs his eyes.  Gloria's are closed.

                                  SUZIE
                  This wasn't my idea.

                                  HUNTER
                  I'm sorry?

     Suzie looks at Sam once more.

                                  SUZIE
                  Look.  I just don't want to get into any
                  more trouble...

     Tom Baxter rises to his feet.  The Judge raises a hand, motioning
     him to sit back down.

                                 JUDGE
                         (to Baxter)
                  The Court would like to hear what Miss

                  Miss Toller.

                  Mr. Lombardo didn't rape me.  He didn't
                  rape Kelly either.  He didn't do
                  anything.

     QUICK CUTS

     Hunter slumps back against the prosecution table.

     Sandra's hand covers her mouth.  Baxter mumbles a curse.

     Sam hangs his head in relief.  Ken grins above his neck brace.

     COURTROOM LOBBY

     The press corps scrambles for cameras.

     BLUE BAY HIGS

     Teachers, students, Art, Jimmy -- crammed around the TV.

                                  JIMMY
                  I don't believe it...

     IN THE COURTROOM

     Bryce Hunter and Tom Baxter are both on their feet, trying to
     make themselves heard above the din.

                                  HUNTER
                  Your Honor... I must object...

                                  JUDGE
                         (hammering for order)
                  I think I made it plain that the Court
                  intends to near Miss Toller's story.

     The Judge turns a cold eye on Suzie.

                                  SUZIE
                  I'm sorry.

                                  JUDGE
                  Sorry?  Just how far did you intend to
                  let this go?

                                  SUZIE
                  I don't know.  I just wanted to hurt Mr.
                  Lombardo.

     Sam looks up, confused.

                                  SUZIE (CONT'D)
                  He was my friend at first.  Then I got
                  busted... he didn't even stick up for
                  me.  I had to go away to that hellhole.
                  It's like, you're his favorite, then who
                  cares?  You wanna know something?  When
                  Kelly said we should do this, I thought
                  cool, all these big shots screwing me
                  over, like that cop, Duquette.  Now
                  they're gonna get screwed.

                                  HUNTER
                  Your Honor... Please...

                                  JUDGE
                  Any more interruptions Mr. Hunter, and
                  the Court will hold you in contempt.
                         (to Suzie)
                  What you are telling me, Ms. Toller, is
                  that Kelly Van Ryan is responsible for
                  conceiving this entire charade...

                                  SUZIE
                  Kelly's pissed at Mr. Lombardo, too.
                  She's in love with him.  I mean her
                  whole fantasy is him since her old man
                  died.  Then she found out that Mr.
                  Lombardo was doing her mom.  I mean that
                  was it...

     Gasps in the court as --

     Kelly BURSTS from the witness waiting room, trailed by a bailiff.

                                  KELLY
                  You stupid little bitch...

     She grabs the first thing she can get her hands on -- a glass of
     water from one of the tables and hurls it toward the witness
     stand before the bailiff can pin her arms against her sides.

     INT. COURTHOUSE LOBBY - LATER

     A mob scene.  Video crews are herded to one side by bailiffs as
     Sandra and Baxter, with Kelly in tow, move toward a side door.

     Sam and Ken round a corner, followed by Ray and Gloria who walk
     on either side of Suzie.

     Kelly sees them.  She makes a run at Suzie.  For a moment the
     girls shove and kick but Ray and Gloria are between them in a
     hurry, pulling then apart as Baxter arrives to take charge of
     Kelly, pulling her toward the door.

     Ruby and Walter arrive now too.  Suzie runs to them and they lead
     her through the crowd, Walter pushing people aside with his long,
     tattooed arms.

     Gloria heaves a sigh.  Ray pushes a hand through his hair, then
     turns to find Sam looking at him.  Most of the press have run off
     to follow the girls -- looking for more action.  It is a quiet
     moment.  The two men lock eyes.

                                  SAM
                  I've found that adolescents make the
                  best liars.  They're old enough to be
                  good at it, but you want like hell to
                  believe them, because they're still
                  children.

     Ray just looks at him -- a hard stare.

     EXT./INT. KEN'S T-BIRD - DAY

     top down, speeds on a highway, banana palms on one side, the blue
     Atlantic on the other.

     Wind buffets Ken and Sam -- who has a dazed look.

                                  KEN
                         (hyped)
                  Come on, let loose!

                                  SAM
                  I was just thinking about where I'm
                  gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's
                  like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.

                                  KEN
                  You'll get over it. We've got a
                  knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a
                  lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.

                                  SAM
                  Just like that?

                                  KEN
                  Just like that?  These people ruined
                  your life, bro.

     Ken pauses to thump the wheel with the butt of his hand.

                                  KEN (CONT'D)
                  I told you they were going overboard and
                  they did... They'll settle.  Believe me.
                  They'll be begging to settle...

     At which point Ken spots something up ahead.  His smile broadens.
     He swerves into the other lane, tooting his horn, waving, as...

     The T-bird draws even with a sleek black limo.

                                  SAM
                  You don't think you're overdoing it?

     He pulls off his neck brace, dangles it in front of Sam's face,
     then tosses it out the window.

     INT. LIMO - MOVING - SAME

     Tom Baxter watches as the T-bird rockets off into the distance, a
     white piece of foam rubber bouncing across the road in its wake.

     A console TV is on -- news of the courthouse chaos.

     Sandra is next to Baxter.  Kelly is on the opposite bench seat.

                                  SANDRA
                  I hope you're going to nail his scrotum
                  to the nearest wall.

                                  BAXTER
                  That might have been a possibility, if
                  little miss not-so-bright here hadn't
                  started throwing things.

                                  KELLY
                  Fuck off.

   Sandra lunges to slap Kelly.  Baxter stops it in midair.

                                  BAXTER
                  See what I mean...

                                  SANDRA
                  You're going to let them get away with
                  this... this shit?  On the word of one
                  little white trash bitch...

                                  BAXTER
                  You like seeing your name in the papers?

     Sandra glares at him.

                                  BAXTER (CONT'D)
                  Leave town, Sandy.  Go to your place in
                  St. Barts.  Let things cool down.

     Sandra concentrates on the TV.

                                  BAXTER (CONT'D)
                  They'll try for twenty million.  The
                  cheaper the lawyer, the higher the
                  demand.

                                  SANDRA
                  You've got to be kidding.

                                  HAXTER
                  The man's life has been destroyed.
                  There will always be doubters, no matter
                  what happened in court.

                                  SANDRA
                  I'm not paying any idiot twenty million
                  dollars.

                                  BAXTER
                  I said that's what they'd ask for.

     Sandra stares from the window.  At last she turns to Kelly.
         
                                  SANDRA
                  I hope you're happy.

     Kelly seems to give this a moment's thought, then, smiling.

                                  KELLY
                  Ecstatic.

     EXT. EVERGLADES - DAY

     Sam cruises slowly across the water in his junked-out air boat.
     He kills the engine, allowing the craft to glide to a stop.

     He's close to where he found the big gator -- the same shabby
     collection of whitewashed buildings we now RECOGNIZE as the
     Glades Motel, shimmers in the distance.

     Sam leans back, enjoying the silence.  He reaches into a cooler,
     takes out a beer, opens it, takes a drink, then pulls something
     else from the cooler --

     -- a bundle of white butcher's paper.  Sam opens the paper, takes
     out raw meat -- something disgusting to look at -- big red turkey
     necks, maybe, which he tosses into the water.

     ANGLE ON WATER

     as the meat drifts down -- then, a sudden boiling, as -- quick as
     the strike of a snake -- the huge gator EMERGES, jaws wide, to
     snap up the morsel before slipping beneath the surface once mare.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. LAW OFFICE - DAY

     Ken's Secretary opens the inner office door for Baxter.
     Ken rises from a desk to greet him.

                                  KEN
                  Tom Baxter.  Good to see you again.

                                  BAXTER
                  Let's cut the crap.  What does your
                  client want?

                                  KEN
                  Besides an apology?

                                  BAXTER
                  Unless you're planning on leaving Blue
                  Bay, there's gonna be other cases, other
                  days... You might want to keep that in
                  mind.

                                  KEN
                  Okay Tom.  My client wants your client
                  to saddle up... so we can ride her ass
                  all the way to the bank.

     EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY

     A hot morning in June.  Shadows angle across the campus.

     Students line up at the old wooden pagoda, picking up caps and
     gowns.  A few turn, surprised to see...

     SAM LOMBARDO cross the parking lot, ENTERS a building.

     INT. ART'S OFFICE - ART

     working at his desk.  Sam's terrarium is behind him, his
     "Educator of the Year" Waterford bowl, a storage box of files.

     Art looks up at a KNOCK on the DOOR.  Sam walks into the room.
     It is a slightly awkward moment.

                                  SAM
                  Lizards don't seem to miss me.

     The two men smile, breaking the tension.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  How you doing, Artie?

                                  ART
                  I... You know... I...

     Sam waves him off.

                                  SAM
                  Take care of my lizards, Art.

     Art stands up.  The two men shake hands.

     OUTSIDE GUIDANCE OFFICE

     Sam comes out, then stops suddenly.

     Kelly waits for him.  Kirk and Nicole are with her.  A long
     moment.

                                  SAM
                  Kelly...

                                  KELLY
                  Drop dead... You know where my mom is
                  trying to get the money to pay you off?
                  She's trying to break my trust.  How do
                  you like that?  I can't touch it until
                  she's dead and she won't give me a dime
                  and now she's trying to break it to pay
                  you...

                                  SAM
                  Look, Kelly... I'm sorry... I know what
                  you've been through... I should've seen
                  something like this coning.

     Art APPEARS in the door behind Sam.  Kelly cones closer.

                                  KELLY
                  Why don't you start fucking her again.
                  You can spend it together.

     Kirk tries to take Kelly's arm.  She jerks away, swings at Sam.

     He ducks, dropping the Waterford BOWL, which SHATTERS upon the
     floor.

     Kirk bear-hugs Kelly.  She throws a notebook at Sam.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  I hate you!

     She starts crying.  Kirk and Nicole drag her away as a crowd
     gathers.

     Sam, shaken, kneels over the broken crystal.  Art bends to help
     him pick up the pieces.

                                  SAM
                  You see.  I couldn't stay, even if I
                  wanted to.

     EXT. STRIP MALL - NIGHT

     Sam's Jeep is parked next to the T-bird and Jaguar.

     INT. KEN'S OFFICE - SAME

     Baxter, Ken, Sandra, Frankie stand watching, as Sam signs papers.
     At last Sam looks up, faces Sandra -- not a happy moment.

     Sandra gives him a long, hard stare, then walks from the room.
     Frankie prepares to follow her, then stops, looks at Sam.

                                  FRANKIE
                  I'll be seeing you.

     Sam just looks at him.  The big man leaves.  Baxter closes his
     briefcase.

                                  KEN
                  So long, Tom.  Come by sometime.  We'll
                  have lunch at the Beef Bowl.

     Baxter stops, gives him a cold look, then a surprising smile.

                                  BAXTER
                  I don't think you're gonna be eating at
                  the Beef Bowl anymore, kid.

     He EXITS.  Ken goes apeshit -- whoops, dances around the desk,
     drops into his chair, holds up the documents.

     Sam watches, smiling, finally.

                                  SAM
                  Thanks Ken, you did okay.

     Both men stand, they shake hands.  Ken claps him on the arm.

                                  KEN
                         (no clowning now)
                  Look, I know there's a part of you
                  wishes none of this had happened.  But
                  it did.  Now take the money and get out
                  of here.  Find a happy place.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. EVERGLADES - NIGHT

     Moonlit fog -- the vast swamp.

     EXT. GLADES MOTEL - NIGHT

     It's late.  A neon palm tree flashes across an empty lot as...

     Sam's Jeep pulls in out of the night, parks before its bungalow.
     Sam gets out, lifts his storage box of files from the rear.

     INT. BUNGALOW - NIGHT

     The neon's green light slashes across the dark walls through old
     Venetian blinds.

     Sam ENTERS, puts the file box on the floor.  Arches a sore back.

     He reaches for a bedside lamp, stops, listens, decides it's
     nothing, reaches again for the lamp, stops again, listening...

     BZZZZZ -- the high-pitched WHINE of a MOSQUITO.  Then more -- a
     flurry of BZZZZZZZZS

     Sam frowns, sees...

     A cloud of mosquitoes circling him.

     He checks the front windows -- closed.  He goes around the bed.
     The slightly ajar bathroom door with full-length mirror comes up
     on his right.  Ahead is a rear window -- wide open.

     Sam stops fast.
         
     Thinks.  Lets out a breath.

                                  SAM
                  Damn maid.

     He steps to the window.  He looks down --

     Muddy footprints.

     Sam freezes.  He whirls around --

     A sudden green FACE APPEARS in the big mirror -- like a nightmare
     image -- lit by the neon flash, then DISAPPEARS.

     Sam jumps back.

                                  SAM
                  Ahhhh!

     The neon green face flashes again in the mirror -- DISAPPEARS.
     Now the bathroom door slowly opens all the way.

     Sam backs up, hits the wall.

     Kelly Van Ryan steps out of the bathroom, a long object held at
     her side, wrapped in a towel.

                                  SAM
                  Jesus Christ, what are you doing?

                                  KELLY
                  So you got my mom's money.

     Sam tries to breathe, manages a nod.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  How much?

     Kelly prods him with the concealed object.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  How much?

                                  SAM
                  About six and a half million dollars.

     Kelly raises the abject covered by the towel, aims it at Sam.

                                  KELLY
                  Your turn to pay.

     A moment -- then she yanks the towel away to REVEAL --

     --  a two-foot-long novelty penis with giant balls.  Her hand
     grips the acrylic scrotum like the butt of a gun.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  King Dong!  That's you, Sam!

     She screams with joy, vaults into his arms, wraps those perfect
     thighs around him.  The dildo goes flying.  They fall on the bed.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  It worked!  We screwed the bitch!

     She's all over him now -- tongue kisses.

                                  KELLY CCONT'D)
                  It worked just like you said it would.

     He kisses her, finally gets her to sit, straddling him.

                                  SAM
                  God, you scared the shit out of me.  You
                  must be crazy coming here.

                                  KELLY
                  Of course I'm crazy.  Ask my mom.

     She kisses him again, more passionately now.  He gets into it,
     tears her blouse open, putting his tongue to her breasts.

     A SHADOW moves on the wall, looming above them.  Sam sees it, his
     eyes widen.  He tries to sit up, as...

     BANG! -- an EXPLOSION.  Sam jumps, knocks Kelly to his side.

     A champagne cork hits the ceiling.

     Suzie Toller stands over the bed with a foaming champagne bottle.

                                  SUZIE
                  How much is about six and a half million
                  divided by three?

                                  SAM
                  Jesus.  Two million one hundred
                  thirty-three thousand three hundred
                  thirty-three and change.

     Kelly screams in joy again.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  Now calm down.  Both of you.

     The girls put on mock serious expressions.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  From now on, if we're seen together,
                  it's got to be accidental.  I thought
                  that was understood...

                                  KELLY
                  Hey, come on... We've got to have at
                  least one victory party.

     Kelly grabs the champagne, takes a long gulp, pours some on her
     breasts as she straddles Sam once more, inviting him to lick them
     clean.

                                  SAM
                  Kelly, for christ's sake...

     She has begun to move like a lap dancer, inviting him to take her
     breasts in his mouth, putting a hand to his crotch...

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  The only way we're gonna blow this now,
                  is if we do it ourselves...

                                  KELLY
                         (her hand in his crotch)
                  Do it to ourselves?

                                  SAM
                         (weakening)
                  We have to stick with the plan.

                                  KELLY
                  Stick?

     Sam gives up, lays back as Kelly undoes his pants, then moves to
     get him inside her.

     Suzie watches.  She takes another drink, then tosses the bottle,
     pulling off her top, REVEALING her small, white breasts, a couple
     of tattoos, a pierced nipple.  She slips behind Kelly, fondling
     Kelly's breasts as Sam arches beneath them both -- all of them
     totally into it now, losing themselves in the sex...

                                                 FADE TO:

     INT. DETECTIVZS' ROOM, BLUE BAY POLICE STATION - NIGHT

     The room is dark and empty, with the exception of a single desk
     lamp, by which halo we find...

     Ray Duquette, in an aloha shirt, waiting as his computer's
     printer finishes a job, as suddenly...

     ... a new light rushes into the room.  Ray turns to find Gloria
     standing in the doorway.  He stops as his printer finishes the
     job.  He pulls out the paper, looks at it, smiles.  Gloria walks
     to his desk.

                                  RAY
                  You saw the news today?

                                  GLORIA
                  Lombardo's settlement?

     Ray nods.

                                  GLORIA (CONT'D)
                  Yeah, well, I told you they were gonna
                  make us look stupid.

     Ray gives her a long look.  Gloria waits a moment, shrugs.

                                  RAY
                  Hey, don't back away from it, you were
                  right.  We did look stupid.
                         (beat)
                  What you were wrong about, is who made
                  us look that way.

     Gloria just looks at him, puzzled.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  Think back, before the suit was filed,
                  before the trial.  Lombardo had an
                  affair with Sandra, right?
                         (Gloria nods)
                  So why not tell us about the affair?  I
                  mean it could be a hell of a motive for
                  Kelly to fabricate her charge in the
                  first place.

                                  GLORIA
                  Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the
                  affair for the trial.

                                  RAY
                  I thought of that.  Then I said, come
                  on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is
                  getting trashed.  You want to stop the
                  bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail
                  for three months.  Unless...

                                  GLORIA
                  Unless what?

                                  RAY
                  Unless you're setting up Sandra Van Ryan
                  for the big payday.

     It is quiet in the office, save for the soft BUZZ of Ray's
     COMPUTER.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  They chumped us, Gloria, right from the
                  start.

                                  GLORIA
                  Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty
                  good already, nice job in a beautiful
                  setting, popular, an active social life.
                         (beat)
                  He's gonna put this all on the line for
                  some dicey play like what you're
                  describing...

                                  RAY
                         (interrupting)
                  The job looks okay to us.  But look at
                  it from his point of view.  The man's
                  surrounded by wealth and privilege.  But
                  for him... it's just a reminder of what
                  should have been his.

     Gloria gives this a moment's thought.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  Your old man graduates from Blue Bay
                  School, you're not supposed to wind up
                  there.  Board of Directors maybe, but
                  not in the lousy guidance office.  Now.
                  Point number two.
                         (he taps at the printout
                          on his desk)
                  I've run a financial on Lombardo.  Guy
                  was eyeball-deep in debt before this all
                  happened -- trying to keep up with
                  pricey trim like Barbara Baxter.

     He passes the printout to Gloria.  She looks at it, thinking.

                                  GLORIA
                  So what about the girls?  Suzie's poor,
                  but why would Kelly have to steal from
                  her own mother?  Surely her father...

                                  RAY
                         (interrupting)
                  Her father didn't leave her squat.  The
                  kid's got money in trust from her
                  grandfather, but she can't touch that
                  till her mother dies and Sandra seems to
                  have the idea that Kelly ought to learn
                  the value of a buck.

     Gloria looks over Lombardo's financial once more, tosses it on
     the desk, then studies Ray -- long beat.

                                  GLORIA
                  This one's got you working overtime,
                  hasn't it?

                                  RAY
                  I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's
                  dirty.  And I'll tell you something
                  else.  You want to know how old man
                  Lombardo lost his money?
                         (beat)
                  He was fucked out of it by old man Van
                  Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt
                  Creek Land Deal.
                         (beat)
                  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a
                  corporation to develop swamp land, got
                  investors like Lombardo to put up money,
                  then turned around and got the state to
                  declare the area an ecological preserve,
                  on the sly, of course, but everyone knew
                  it was him.  The freeway went to the
                  coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.

                                  GLORIA
                  Eliminate the competition.

                                  RAY
                  You got it.  The rich got richer.  While
                  the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in
                  the swamp.

     Gloria looks at him a long moment.

                                  GLORIA
                  Where'd you come up with this stuff,
                  anyway?

                                  RAY
                         (a long beat; then
                          beneath a smile)
                  I net a guy in a bar.

     EXT. A BANK, BLUE BAY - DAY

     Sam walks down the steps, gets into his Jeep, and drives away.

     Across the street -- the white Taurus -- Ray and Gloria watch.

     EXT. YACHT BROKERAGE - DAY

     Sam comes out, rounds a corner and is gone.

     Ray Duquette steps INTO FRAME, turns into the brokerage.  The
     door swings shut behind him.

     INT. SWIMMING POOL, BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY

     Girls in tank suits finish laps, towel off.  As the girls begin
     to walk toward the lockers, they encounter...

     Ray Duquette, threading his way among the girls, his eye on...

     Kelly, alone on the deck, still dripping -- a Botticelli vision.

                                  RAY (O.S.)
                  Nice stroke.

     Kelly, startled, turns to find Ray walking toward her across the
     deck.  She snatches a towel from one of the racing platforms and
     begins to dry herself, wrapping the towel around her.

                                 KELLY
                  Is there some reason why you're here?

                                 RAY
                  Curiosity, I guess.

                                 KELLY
                  About what?  How to improve your breast
                  stroke?

     Ray gives her a cold smile.

                                 RAY
                  Actually, I was curious about how you
                  see things working out, for you, Sam and
                  Suzie.

     This appears to give her pause, a moment of hesitation.

                                  KELLY
                  Excuse me?

                                  RAY
                  You all gonna go down to the Caribbean
                  together?

     Kelly looks around the pool area.  A number of girls are watching
     from a corner of the deck, but no one is close enough to hear.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  The thing about it is, threesomes so
                  rarely work out.

                                  KELLY
                  You're out of your mind.

                                  RAY
                  I've been a cop for a while, Kelly.
                         (beat)
                  It's hard enough for one person to keep
                  a secret, let alone three.  And then
                  there's the love angle.  I mean do you
                  and Sam really want that little
                  pill-head around, now that you have the
                  money?

     Kelly starts to walk away.  Ray cuts her off.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea
                  right up front, of whacking Suzie?
                  That's murder, Kelly.

                                  KELLY
                  Police -- God -- get a life.

     She moves around him and walks calmly away.

                                  RAY
                         (loud enough to make
                          himself heard)
                  You're good.  But you don't think that
                  little ditz Suzie's gonna hold together,
                  do you?

     Kelly continues to walk, her face giving nothing away, as Ray's
     WORDS ECHO over the pool.

     EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL PARKING LOT - LONG SHOT - LATER

     Only a few cars left -- one of them Suzie's old VW bug, at the
     side of which Kelly and Suzie engage in heated conversation.

     CLOSER - SUZIE

     paces around Kelly.

                                  SUZIE
                  You don't know Duquette.  I'm the one he
                  busted... He's a fucker, man... He'll
                  fuck us both over...

     Kelly tries to take her by the arm.  Suzie jerks away.

                                  SUZIE (CONT'D)
                  I'm not going back to that prison.
                  That's what it was... a fucking hell
                  hole...

     Kelly looks around the lot.  She takes Suzie by the arm once
     more, this time more firmly, pulling Suzie to her.

                                  KELLY
                  Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna
                  come to you just like he did to me.
                  You're gonna have to be ready for him.

                                  SUZIE
                  Yeah, but he can't push you around like
                  he can me.  You've got family and
                  they've got clout.  With we it's
                  different... with me...

                                  KELLY
                         (circling her with her
                          arm)
                  Yeah, I've got family and they've got
                  clout and now you have me.  Right?  And
                  Sam.  Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's
                  not going to send you anywhere.  He's
                  gonna try and rattle your cage, and
                  that's it.  Stay strong and he can't do
                  shit.

                                  SUZIE
                         (a long beat)
                  Man, I wanna smoke a joint.

     PULL BACK to REVEAL -- in the distance -- the white Ford Taurus
     at the side of the road leading to the school.

     The car is pulled just far enough off the road to be mostly
     hidden among pampas grass and oleander, but angled in such a way
     as to afford a view of the two girls now hugging in the lot.

     EXT. SMILIN' JACK'S FISH CAMP - NIGHT

     Suzie wanders along the canal, smoking a joint.  At her back a
     few faint lights flicker here and there in the windows of
     trailers.  She walks down to the little dock, sits on a rail,
     takes another hit.

                                  VOICE (0.S.)
                  'Evening, Suzie.  How was school today?

     Suzie freezes, holds back her exhale, looking around...

     A shadow stirs in one of the skiffs tied to the dock.  A man
     stands, walks up the couple of wooden stairs.  The light from a
     trailer across the road glances off steel-rimmed glasses as Ray
     Duquette steps onto the dock.

     Suzie gags on the smoke in her lungs, coughs.  She squeezes the
     lit roach into her palm, then tosses it into the canal.

                                  RAY
                  You ought to watch it with that shit,
                  Suzie.  You get busted again, you go
                  back in a two-tine loser.

                                  SUZIE
                  You got something against cigarettes?

     Ray just laughs at her.

                                  RAY
                  Yeah, they're bad for your health.
                         (beat)
                  I'm tryin' to look out for you...

                                  SUZIE
                  That's cop bullshit.

                                  RAY
                  Well, you're half right.  Best thing you
                  could do for yourself right now would be
                  to talk to me.

                                  SUZIE
                  About what?

                                  RAY
                  Every triangle I've ever seen never
                  lasts.  Somebody's got to go.

                                  SUZIE
                  Is this supposed to mean something to
                  me?  What triangle?

                                  RAY
                  You, Kelly, Sam.

                                  SUZIE
                  I don't have to listen to this.  And you
                  can't shove me around.  I have friends
                  now...

     She catches herself, falters.

     Ray laughs once more.

                                  RAY
                  Is that what you think?  You have
                  friends?  Is that what they told you?

                                  SUZIE
                  I don't mean who you're thinking.  I
                  have other friends...

                                  RAY
                  Suzie, Suzie... This is me, Ray, you're
                  talking to.  We both know you don't have
                  shit, never have had shit, never will
                  have shit...

     He takes a sheet of paper from his coat.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  Here, Suzie.  I want you :o look this
                  over.  Know what it is?
                         (as Suzie takes it)
                  Sam deposited his check, transferred the
                  funds to an offshore bank, a numbered
                  account.  Not even the cops can find out
                  whose names are on it.  Think one of
                  them's yours?

     Suzie looks over the paper.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  He also put a down on some island
                  property, and a lease-to-buy on a
                  forty-foot sailboat.  You're into
                  sailing, aren't you, Suzie?

     Suzie thrusts the paper back at Ray.

                                  SUZIE
                  Get away from me.

                                  RAY
                  Don't you see what this means?  You
                  really think Sam and Kelly are gonna
                  give you a third of the money?  You, the
                  pill-head with the rap sheet?

                                  SUZIE
                  Shut up.

     Ray smiles at her.  He moves up close.

                                  RAY
                  You know, I don't think I ever told you
                  I was sorry about your little friend...
                  What was his name?

     Suzie tries to back away.  She bumps against the rail.  Ray
     reaches out, takes her hand in both of his.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  Come on, Suzie, help me out here.  You
                  know his name.

     Suzie looks scared, in a way she hasn't before.  When she speaks
     her voice is scarcely above a whisper.

                                  SUZIE
                  Davy.

                                  RAY
                         (nodding, a scary smile)
                  That's right.  That was his name.

     The smile fades, as if he's thinking about something, still
     holding her hand, rubbing it with his fingers.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  Sometimes I wonder if you're really as
                  dumb as you pretend to be.

     He looks into Suzie's eyes, slowly opening her hand to REVEAL the
     burn mark on her palm.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  But you know what?  I'd be keeping a
                  clear mind right now if I were you.
                         (beat)
                  I'd hate to see you come to a bad end.
                  Like Davy did.

     He holds her hand a moment longer, then drops it.  He goes back
     down he steps to the little skiff.  An outboard MOTOR STARTS in
     the night.

     INT. SUZIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Suzie cones in fast, grabs the phone, punches out a number.

                                  SAM (V.0.)
                         (answering machine)
                  This is Sam.  I'm not in right now...

     EXT./INT. RAY'S PICKUP - NIGHT

     parked behind some cottonwoods in a small launch area where the
     highway crosses both the canal and the road to the fish camp.

     The skiff has been shoved into the bed.  Ray sits at the wheel.
     He removes his glasses, wipes his face with a handkerchief, then
     starts at the uneven 50UNDS of a tired ENGINE, looks up to see...

     HEADLIGHTS

     Suzie's VW bouncing along the dirt road, turning onto the
     highway.

     RAY'S TRUCK - RAY

     watching, then starting his truck and pulling out onto the
     highway, following the tiny red lights of Suzie's bug.

     SXT. VAN RYAN ESTATE - MAIN GATE - NIGHT

     Suzie's VW idles.  She leans out the window, talks to the
     intercom, the gate opens.  The VW ENTERS.  The gate closes.

     Ray's pickup drives past.  He drives to a big lot where one of
     the mansions has been torn down.  He drives up onto the dirt,
     keeps going, right down to the water's edge where he pulls his
     little skiff out of the back once more.

     He walks back to the truck, pulls off his sport coat, hangs a
     Hi-8 video camera over his shoulder and wades out into the calm
     waters of the bay, pushing the skiff, then climbing in.

     EXT. VAN RYAN ESTATE, REAR OF MAIN HOUSE - NIGHT

     Suzie follows Kelly past the pool, which is all lit~up, and on
     toward the jacuzzi.  The whole deck is tiled in black-and-white.

     Kelly's in a bikini -- the killer body.  Suzie, the contrast --
     pale, skinny, boyish, in a T-shirt and cutoff jeans.  They
     argue -- we CANNOT HEAR.

     EXT. THE BAY - SAME

     Ray has arrived near the docks.  He has killed his engine,
     maneuvering here with a single oar.  He ties the skiff off behind
     the Jonathan, then climbs to the dock, moving around the guest
     house and coming close to the pool.  He takes a position behind
     the cabanas, readies his camera.

     EXT. POOL AREA - SAME

     Kelly and Suzie continue their argument in front of the jacuzzi.

                                  KELLY
                  I can't believe you called Sam.  What's
                  the matter with you?

                                  SUZIE
                  I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared
                  there's no one to trust.

                                  KELLY
                  You can trust me.

     A cordless PHONE RINGS on the patio chair.  Kelly and Suzie are
     startled by it.  Kelly answers.

     INT. SAM'S BUNGALOW - NIGHT

     The bedside lamp is on.  Sam is on the phone.

                                  SAM
                  Kelly.  Is Suzie there?

                                  KELLY (V.O.)
                  Yes.

                                  SAM
                  Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left
                  this garbled message on my machine.
                         (beat)
                  Can you calm her down?

                                  KELLY (V.0.)
                  Why can't you come...

                                  SAM
                  No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm
                  counting on you.  You calm her down.
                  I mean do whatever you have to, whatever
                  it takes...

                                  KELLY (V.O.)
                  You know what it takes.

                                  SAM
                  Then do it.  I need you on this Kelly.
                  Do it tonight.  We'll figure something
                  out... Okay?

     EXT. JACUZZI - NIGHT

     Kelly glances across the steamy water at Suzie.

                                  KELLY
                  Yeah, right.  Can you at least talk to
                  her, on the phone?

     NT. SAM'S BUNGALOW - SAME

     Sam lies on his bed, waits for Suzie's voice on the line.

                                  SUZIE (V.O.)
                  Sam...

                                  SAM
                  Put Kelly on too.

     EXT. JACUZZI - SAME

     The girls stand cheek-to-cheek, the phone between them.

                                  KELLY
                  I'm here.

     INT. SAM'S BUNGALOW - SAME

                                  SAM
                  Okay.  I want you to hear this too.
                  We've got to be cool.  All of us.
                  People think I'm rich, for Christ's
                  sake.   I'm doing what rich guys do.
                         (beat)
                  I'm spending my money.  It's more
                  suspicious if I sit around doing
                  nothing.  Now don't let this cop fuck
                  with your minds.

     EXT. CABANAS - NIGHT

     Ray tapes the scene.

     The girls still hold the phone.

                                  SUZIE
                  But I..

                                  SAM (V.0.)
                  Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only
                  people who can blow this is us.
                  Remember?

                                  KELLY
                  Right.

     Suzie says nothing.  Kelly nudges her.

                                  SUZIE
                  Yeah, right.

                                  SAM (V.0.)
                  Good.  Just keep telling yourselves
                  that, the only people who can fuck this
                  up is us.

     The line goes dead.  Kelly hangs up.  Suzie stares into the
     jacuzzi.

                                  SUZIE
                  You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?

                                  KELLY
                  Oh, for Christ's sake.

                                  SUZIE
                  You are.

                                  KELLY
                  Are you retarded, or just brain dead
                  from whiffin' fumes out there in the
                  swamp...

     Suzie's face goes hard.

                                  SUZIE
                  That's what I am to you, isn't it?
                  Swamp trash.  It's what I am to
                  everybody, just like my mom...

     Kelly tries to put an arm around her.  Suzie slaps her -- a
     mistake -- Kelly's bigger, faster.  She slaps the side of Suzie's
     head, then grabs her legs, dumping her on the tile deck.

     ON RAY

     focusing the camera.

     Suzie tries to kick Kelly.

     Something changes in Kelly, a scary, calm rage.

                                  KELLY
                  Stupid bitch.

     She very methodically grabs Suzie's hair, dragging her into the
     jacuzzi, holding her under the hot water.

     Suzie thrashes, breaks free, gags, arches out of the water, the
     wet T-shirt clinging to her small breasts.

     Kelly is on her again, slaps her, puts her hands to Suzie's
     throat -- violently sexual in her wet bikini.

     Kelly slams Suzie back onto the black-and-white tile, gets on top
     of her, knees between Suzie's legs, her hands on her throat.

     Suzie's skinny shape writhes underneath Kelly on the gleaming
     tile.  She gasps for air.  Kelly finally lets go, but remains on
     her knees between Suzie's legs, breathing hard.  A moment.  Kelly
     touches Suzie's face.

                                  KELLY
                  Why do you make me hurt you?  It's like
                  you want it or something.

     Suzie sobs, takes Kelly's hand.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  God, you are scared, aren't you?

     Suzie runs her lips over Kelly's fingers, then pushes her T-shirt
     up, pushing Kelly's hand onto her breast.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  And this is going to make you feel
                  better, make you trust me...

     Suzie nods, tearing her T-shirt, getting both of Kelly's hands
     onto her breasts, then pushing at Kelly's wrists, getting her to
     pull at her nipples, hard... Kelly obliges...

     Suzie cries out in pain.  Kelly's hands move down to pull off
     Suzie's bottoms...

     ON RAY

     still at it with the video, his face impassive, watching.

     As Kelly pulls Suzie back into the jacuzzi, as the girls' hands
     slide round the curves of each other's hips, pulling themselves
     to each other, as the layers of steam rise to envelope them...

                                                 CUT TO:

     VIDEOTAPE

     Kelly and Suzie making love in the jacuzzi.

     PULL BACK to REVEAL --

     INT. POLICE ROOM - DAY

     Gloria, Ray, Hunter watch the tape.  Hunter's seen enough.  He
     slams the stop/tape.

                                  HUNTER
                  Are you crazy, Ray?

                                  RAY
                  You heard Kelly say "Sam."  That was
                  Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the
                  girls...

                                  HUNTER
                  Ray.  The conversation on this tape is
                  totally unintelligible.
                         (beat)
                  What we have here, is you on the Van
                  Ryan property, without a proper warrant,
                  shooting a porn flick...

                                  RAY
                  I don't believe I'm hearing this.  A
                  month ago you were pulling these two
                  apart at the courthouse.
                         (beat)
                  They were acting.  They were all acting,
                  from the beginning.  And we bought it,
                  hook, line and sinker... And now they're
                  home free with six million of Sandra Van
                  Ryan's money.

                                  GLORIA
                  Which she might have saved, if she
                  hadn't set out to destroy the man's
                  life.

                                  RAY
                         (turning now on Gloria)
                  What?  You wouldn't go after some guy
                  you thought raped your daughter?
                         (beat)
                  Cone on.  She bought the same story we
                  did...

     Ray stops as Hunter brings the palm of his hand down on the table
     a loud SLAP.

                                  HUNTER
                  Listen, both of you.  You're not on a
                  case.  There is no fucking case.
                         (beat)
                  I've had it up to here with Sandra Van
                  Ryan.  Ray, you keep mucking around like
                  this and you are going to have her suing
                  us for invasion of privacy.  Get out of
                  these people's lives.
                         (beat)
                  Am I getting through on this?

     Ray walks to the door, jerks it open --

     INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

     Sam, angry, sits in the corridor with a uniformed officer.

     Hunter sees Sam, rolls his eyes.

                                  HUNTER
                  Oh, Ray... no...

                                  RAY
                  You think this is just about money,
                  about us looking foolish?  Question him.
                  You're gonna find a stone cold
                  manipulative psychopath.  And those
                  girls are going to wind up dead...

     Sam lunges at Ray.  The officer and Hunter restrain him.  Gloria
     looks on, taken aback by Ray's accusations, Sam's response.

                                  HUNTER
                  Mr. Lombardo, please.  I'm sorry about
                  this.

                                  SAM
                  Give this idiot something to do.  Let
                  him look into the Kennedy assassination.

     Ray flares, grabs Sam, shoves him against the wall, before they
     can be separated once again.

                                  SAM (CCNT'D)
                         (to Hunter)
                  Next time this guy drags me down here,
                  I'll sue you.  You're goddamn lucky I
                  didn't sue you the first time!

     Sam storms from the room, followed by Hunter.  Ray stares after
     them, finally he turns, looks at Gloria, collecting himself.

                                  RAY
                  Guess I kind of lost it there.

                                  GLORIA
                  You could say that.

                                  RAY
                  Were you ever in a situation where you
                  could see a thing coming and you didn't
                  do what you could to stop it?

     Gloria studies Ray, clearly concerned.

                                  GLORIA
                  We all have...

                                  RAY
                  I mean something bad, Gloria, something
                  bad you saw coning, and you didn't do
                  anything, and then it happened.
                         (off Gloria's silence)
                  I did that once.  I don't want to do it
                  again.

     EXT. MALL ENTRANCE - LATE AFTERNOON

     Sam EXXTS a building, a large package of wrapped goods beneath
     his arm.  He looks toward the parking lot where --

     Barbara Baxter stands beside the red Mercedes.  She tips a valet
     then starts toward the mall.  She sees San.  Their eyes meet.  A
     moment of hesitation, as neither is quite sure what to say.

                                  SAM
                  You look pretty.

                                  BARBARA
                  Thanks.

     Sam smiles.  She points to the stuff beneath his arm.

                                  BARBARA (CONT'D)
                  Quite a shopping spree...

     She's kidding, then seems to consider how Sam might take it.

                                  BARBARA (CONT'D)
                  I didn't mean...

     Sam laughs it off.

                                  SAM
                  Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend
                  it, right?  I've always wanted to live
                  where I could dive for my dinner.

                                  BARBARA
                  And where might that be?

                                  SAM
                  I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.

                                  BARBARA
                  I love Antigua.
                         (beat)
                  Maybe I'll come visit you.

                                  SAM
                  I'd like that.

     A moment, she touches his face.  Sam raises a hand to cover hers,
     as...

     ... in b.g., a BLACK RANGE ROVER -- just the roof VISIBLE above
     the tops of the other cars, cruises the lot.

     INT. RANGE ROVER - KELLY VAN RYAN

     seated at the wheel, parks, stares toward the mall entrance.

     ANGLE ON ENTRANCE - KELLY'S POV

     Sam and Barbara stand in the orange light, hand-in-hand.  Barbara
     leans forward, kisses Sam on the lips.

     CLOSE ON KELLY

     lost in thought, when she is startled by a sudden CACOPHONY of
     ENGINE NOISE.  She turns to find...

     Suzie's BUG, SPLUTTERING and BELCHING smoke, parks next to her.

     Suzie opens the door of the Rover, jumps in.  She's wearing a
     black ball cap, armed with a huge straw bag.  As she settles in
     the seat, she lets out a long breath.

     Kelly makes a face, fans the air.

                                  KELLY
                  Jesus.  What are you drinking?

     Suzie laughs, pulls a bottle of Mad Dog 20/20 from the bag.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                         (looking at the bottle)
                  Anybody ever tell you that stuff will
                  rot your brain?

                                  SUZIE
                  What brain?

     Suzie takes a big drink.  Kelly shakes her head, looks back
     toward the entrance.

     ANGLE ON ENTRANCE - KELLY'S POV

     empty.  Sam and Barbara are gone.

     Kelly continues to stare.

                                  SUZIE
                  What are you looking at?

                                  KELLY
                         (starting the car)
                  Nothing.

     EXT. THE BEACH - NIGHT

     The Atlantic rolls before a long stretch of empty sand as the
     last red light drains from the sky.

     The Range Rover comes down onto the sand, parks.

     INT./EXT. RANGE ROVER - SAME

     Kelly turns off the engine.  Suzie tokes on a joint, swills the
     MD 20/20.  She gazes upon the sea, eyes at half-mast.

                                  SUZIE
                  I thought we were goin' to a movie.

                                  KELLY
                  I think we just need to get wasted.

     Suzie shrugs, gets out.  Kelly gets out with her.  Suzie
     staggers.  Kelly circles her with an arm, looks nervously around,
     begins leading her down the beach.

                                  SUZIE
                  I wanna live at the beach someday.

                                  KELLY
                  Shit.

     She stops walking.  Suzie takes a few more steps then turns to
     look at her.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  I left the keys.  I'll get 'em.

     Suzie plops down on the sand, drinks from the bottle.  She
     watches Kelly fading into the darkness, mumbles something beneath
     her breath, then lies on her back.

     SUZIE'S POV - THE NIGHT SKY

     The SOUND of CRASHING WAVES.  She rolls to one side, looking down
     the beach

     Murky blackness.

     She tries to focus, sits up.

                                  SUZIE
                  Kelly?

     She stands -- wobbly -- peers down the beach.

     A shape EMERGES in the blackness, moving toward her.

                                  SUZIE (CONT'D)
                  Kelly?

     The shape gets closer and closer, until...

     Sam Lombardo steps up to loom over Suzie.

     She takes a step back.

     Sam puts a hand on her shoulder.  He carries something in his
     other hand -- hard to see on the dark beach.

                                  SAM
                  Suzie, it's okay.  It's me.

     Suzie steadies herself.  A face APPEARS behind Sam -- Kelly.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  I was worried about you, Suzie.  I
                  decided we should all get together, one
                  more time, before we split up.

                                  SUZIE
                  Are you mad at me?

                                  SAM
                  No, no.  Look, I probably should have
                  told you a little more, about the part I
                  intended to play.
                         (beat)
                  We'll go through it all again tonight.

     Sam takes the bottle from Suzie, looks at it.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  This is a celebration Suzie, not a
                  suicide pact.

     He lifts the object in his other hand -- a champagne battle.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  We'll chill out first, have a drink,
                  watch the stars.

     Suzie nods.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  Kelly, there's a beach blanket in the
                  Jeep.  Could you get it for us?

     Kelly nods, starts back, looks once over her shoulder as...

     Sam leads Suzie toward a huge rock formation.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  Let me tell you about this boat I picked
                  out for us...

     They move OUT OF SIGHT.  Kelly continues to walk, back along the
     sand toward the cars.

     INSERT - A SCREAM

     A sickening hollow THWACK -- an arc of blood and two teeth fall
     silently on dark stone.

     Kelly begins to run, stumbling through the sand to Sam's Jeep,
     where she pulls a big roll of clear plastic from behind the
     seats.  She stuffs it under her arm, then runs back along the
     beach.  As she runs, she can hear them -- more THWACKS, MOANS --
     it seems like forever

     Sam APP£ARS before her on the sand.  The champagne bottle swings
     loosely at the end of one arm.  it looks shiny now, dripping with
     Suzie's blood.

     Kelly goes to him.  She looks at the bottle, then throws herself
     against him -- a hard kiss.

                                  SAM
                  I'm sorry, Kelly.  I'm sorry it had to
                  happen like this.  She was losing it...

                                  KELLY
                         (breathless)
                  There was no way.  That cop would've
                  gotten her to tell him... everything.
                  She was weak and dumb...

     She kisses him again, her hands moving over his body.  Sam takes
     a step back, looks into Kelly's face -- the parted lips, sultry
     eyes -- as if seeing her for the first time -- a long beat -- at
     which point he turns, heaving the champagne bottle as far as he
     can into the black waves.

     EXT. RANGE ROVER ON THE SAUD - LATER

     Rear hatch open -- overhead light on.

     Sam and Kelly drag Suzie's body -- wrapped in the plastic -- to
     the rear hatch.  As they heft her inside, the light catches --

     SUZIE'S FACE

     A mask of blood.

     Kelly turns away in disgust.  She goes to the passenger side
     door, gets in.

     Sam gets in behind the wheel.  For a moment the two of them just
     sit there, in the darkness, with the SOUND of the SEA, and their
     own BREATHING.  Sam looks at Kelly.

     She is focused on the dark Atlantic.

                                  SAM
                  Are you okay?

     Kelly turns to him -- an anxious face.

                                  KELLY
                         (a long beat)
                  My mom would kill me if she knew I took
                  the Rover.

     EXT. EVERGLADES - NIGHT

     Kelly waits by the Rover, swatting mosquitoes.

     SLOSHING SOUNDS -- a shape approaches in the dark -- Sam in
     waders, muddy, tired, carrying a shovel.

     EXT. GALLERIA PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     Almost empty of cars.  The Range Rover cruises past Suzie's VW,
     circles, comes back.  Sam jumps out, pulls on latex gloves, gets
     into the VW and backs it out.

     EXT. BUS TERMINAL (MIAMI) - DAY

     Almost dawn.  A long parking lot fronts the terminal.  Suzie's VW
     arrives, parks, Sam gets out.  He goes to the waiting Range
     Rover, gets in and drives away.

     EXT. FRONT GATE - VAN RYAN ESTATE - DAY

     A THIN STREAM OF MUDDY WATER

     flows beneath the gate, down the drive, toward the street.

     A HAND touches the water.

     PULL BACK to REVEAL the hand as that of Ray Duquette.

     EXT. VAN RYAN DRIVEWAY - SAME

     Ray kneels, fingers wriggling in the water, then straightens,
     looking toward the house where...

     On the other side of the gate, Kelly, in a tube-top and tight
     shorts, washes mud from the Range Rover.  She looks up, sees...

     Ray, drying his hand on a handkerchief, walking up the drive,
     arriving at the wrought-iron gates.

                                  RAY
                  Been four-wheelin'?

     Kelly freezes -- not so cool this time.

                                  KELLY
                  Get off my property.

                                  RAY
                  I'm not on your property!

     He grabs the wrought-iron gate -- rattles it -- harder and
     harder.

     Kelly backs away, frightened.

     EXT. SMILIN' JACK'S FISH CAMP - DAY

     Gloria and Ray stand in front of the ramshackle wooden building,
     talking to Ruby.  Walter sits nearby, sharpening a knife.

                                  RAY
                  You say she didn't come back last night.

                                  RUBY
                  She's been sayin' she was going to go to
                  L.A.  But I don't know.  I mean all her
                  clothes are still here.  An' she's
                  missin' her graduation.
                         (a long beat)
                  She should graduate.  She's a smart
                  girl...

     Ray nods.  He makes a note in his pad.

                                  RAY
                  May have been she just partied too
                  much... But we'll look into it.  We find
                  something, you'll be the first to know.

     Ray turns and walks to the car.  Gloria follows.

     INT. CAR - SAME

     Ray sits for a moment behind the wheel.

                                  RAY
                  It's starting, Gloria.  This is how it
                  begins...

                                  GLORIA
                  Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She
                  could be anywhere...

     Ray silences her with a look.

                                  RAY
                  I'm gonna take you back to the office.
                  Will you put out a call on Suzie's car
                  for me?

                                  GLORIA
                  You have someplace to be?

     Ray starts the car, doesn't answer.

                                  GLORIA (CONT'D)
                  If you want company...

                                  RAY
                  Just check out the car.

     Gloria nods.  She looks toward the camp store where the old lady
     can still be SEEN standing on the porch, beneath the jawbones.

     EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY

     Caps and gowns -- kids and parents on the lawn -- taking photos.

     Kelly poses with Sandra.  Tom Baxter aims the camera.

                                  BAXTER
                  Smile.

     Kelly and Sandra force miserable smiles.  CLICK.

                                  BAXTER (CONT'D)
                  That's one for the scrapbook.

     Baxter moves away, greets Nicole and her parents.

     Kelly puts some room between her and Sandra.

                                  KELLY
                  You didn't have to fly back -- from --
                  wherever, for me...

                                  SANDRA
                  I'm here to congratulate my friends and
                  their children.  I'm leaving again
                  tonight.

                                  KELLY
                  Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.

                                  SANDRA
                  Where, the mall?

                                  KELLY
                  A friend of mine bought a boat.

     Sandra shakes her head, walks off.

     Kelly turns away, freezes, as she catches sight of --

     Ray talking with Jimmy.

     EXT. THE BEACH - DAY

     Ray and Jimmy walk along the sand, moving in the direction of the
     big rocks.  Jimmy wears sagger shorts, a surfer T-shirt.  Ray
     wears a suit.  He carries the coat over his shoulder.

                                  JIMMY
                  It's those rocks, up there.

                                  RAY
                  You and Suzie used to come out here
                  together?

                                  JIMMY
                  Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang
                  out here.
                         (beat)
                  You really think something bad happened
                  to Suzie?

                                  RAY
                         (ignoring the question)
                  Lombardo ever come out here?

     Jimmy looks at him, surprised, sees that Ray is serious.  Still,
     the idea generates a laugh.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  I say something funny?

                                  JIMMY
                  No.  But I mean... just the idea that
                  Mr. Lombardo would...

                                  RAY
                  Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with
                  the kids, one of the guys...

                                  JIMMY
                  Yeah, but...

     He breaks off as Ray kneels over a big flat rock.  Ray brushes
     away some sand, drapes the sport coat over his arm, taking
     tweezers and latex gloves from the pockets.

     Jimmy moves closer, curious, seeing what Ray sees.

     CLOSE ON GLOVED HANDS

     as tweezers pick up two teeth from a crevice in the stone.

     Ray straightens, holding the teeth in the palm of his hand.

     Jimmy stares at the teeth.

     Ray takes a couple of bills from his pocket, hands them to Jimmy.

                                  RAY
                  I'm going to be staying here, Jimmy.
                  You can catch a bus up there at the lot,
                  okay?

     Jimmy looks a little sick, but he takes the money.  He starts
     toward the lot.

     Ray watches for a moment.  Then calls out to him.

                                  RAY
                  People aren't always what they appear to
                  be, kid.  Remember it.

     Jimmy looks at him, trying to make sense of what Ray is saying,
     clearly disturbed by the implications.  But he asks no more
     questions.  He turns, trudging alone back through the sand.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. OCEAN COVE - LATER

     THE TEETH go into a plastic bag.

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL

     Black-and-whites, county cars -- police tape across the site.

     Ray, Gloria and Hunter watch as DAVE MERRITT, a forensic expert
     bags the teeth.  He passes the bag to Ray, then bends to the
     rocks where he begins to take a blood sample.

                                  RAY
                  Lonbardo and Kelly killed her here.

     Hunter and Gloria exchange a look.

                  Two kids could've gotten into a fight,

                                  RAY
                  Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.

                  The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a
                  swamp rat, knows the body will never be
                  found there.  But he's made a mistake.

     He holds up the evidence bag containing the teeth.

                                  GLORIA
                  Her grandmother said she'd been
                  threatening to run away.  And I found
                  the car at the Miami bus terminal.

                                  RAY
                  You don't think Sam could've put it
                  there?

                                  HUNTER
                  Dust it for prints.  My guess is, if
                  anybody murdered Suzie it was probably
                  that little sociopath Kelly Van Ryan.

     Ray shakes his head; he turns to Dave, still working.

                                  RAY
                  How soon can we get something?

                                  DAVE
                  We can get blood type right away.
                  Dental records will take longer.  You
                  want DNA, that can take weeks.

     Ray nods, looks out to sea.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.

                                  GLORIA
                  We don't know that, Ray...

     Ray turns to her -- an intense look.

                                  RAY
                  Kelly's next, Gloria.

                                  HUNTER
                         (ice cold)
                  Get off this Ray, now.
                         (beat)
                  If there is any evidence here, it's for
                  Homicide.
                         (turning to Dave)
                  You get an ID, you call me.

     Dave nods.  Hunter stalks off toward his car.  Ray turns to
     Gloria.

                                  RAY
                  Will you do me one favor?

                                  GLORIA

                  What do you do if you see a bad thing
                  coming?

     Gloria looks toward the highway, trying to decide.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  Stick with me on this Gloria.  I need

                  And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll

                  If I'm wrong about those teeth -- it's a
                  promise.

     EXT. GLADES MOTEL - SUNSET

     Sam's Jeep -- a "FOR SALE" sign in the window -- sits in the lot.

     Across the road -- Gloria sits in the white Taurus.

     EXT. VAN RYAN ESTATE, MAIN GATE - SUNSET

     Ray sits in his truck, picks up his cellular, punches in a
     number.

                  Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the

                                  RAY
                  What about the blood?

                         (a beat)
                  Could be hers.  Types match.  Could be a

                                  RAY
                         (cutting him off)
                  Second you get something on those teeth,
                  I want it

     Ray hangs up without waiting for a reply.  He turns to the Van
     Ryan house, an orange light slanting across its facade.

     EXT. GLADES MOTEL - NIGHT

     Gloria waits in her car.  She looks toward the motel.

     Sam's Jeep is parked before one of the bungalows.  There is a
     light on in the room.  We can SEE inside.

     Gloria sighs, picks up a pair of binoculars and trains them on
     the room.

     ANGLE ON ROOM - GLORIA'S POV

     Suitcases and boxes are stacked everywhere.  Sam, bare-chested,
     in khaki slacks, moves about the room.

     CLOSE ON GLORIA

     watching Sam, as...

     IN THE ROOM

     The PHONE has begun to RING.  Sam looks at it until it stops,
     then picks it up and dials a number.  Kelly answers.

                                  KELLY (V.O.)
                  Hello?

     INTERCUT - KELLY/SAM PHONE CONVERSATION

     Kelly is in the guest house, pacing in front of the gun case.

                                  KELLY
                  I'm really serious.  That cop, he keeps
                  watching me.

                                  KELLY
                  I can't help it.  He gives me the
                  creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared
                  of him?  She's not that way.  I think he
                  did something...

                                  SAM
                  Yeah, he got her busted for

                  I don't know... I think it was something
                  else... Suzie says the bust was
                  bullshit...

                                  SAM
                  And you believe her?

                         (beat)
                  I want to see you...

                  Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's
                  valium or something.  In another week
                  you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're

                                  KELLY
                  But what if they find out... God, they'd
                  put you in the gas chamber...

     Sam is about to respond, then looks out the window, sees...

     ACROSS THE STREET, the white Taurus.

                                  SAM
                  So if they're tapping your phone, we're
                  dead.  Stay in the guest house.  Skip
                  the graduation parties.  You'll never
                  see Duquette.  Okay?  I love you.

                                  KELLY
                         (beat)
                  Okay.  I love you too.

     INT. TAURUS - SAME - GLORIA

     sees the light go out in Sam's room, lowers her binoculars, sits
     for a moment, then begins to write something on a pad.

     She's still at it when something KNOCKS at a FENDER.  She looks
     up, startled, to find...

     Sam in the street, still shirtless, his arms and shoulders
     back-lit by the neon light of the Glades Motel.

                                  SAM

                  I don't know what to say...

                                  GLORIA
                  You could tell me where you were last
                  night.

     Sam stares at her.

                                  SAM
                  Goddannit... I don't have to...

     He stops himself, calms down.

                                  SAM
                  Come here.  I want you to see something.

     Gloria hesitates, looks up at Sam, then puts down the phone and
     opens her door.

     INT. GLADES MOTEL - SAME

     Sam and Gloria walk among the boxes and suitcases.

                                  GLORIA
                  Looks like goodbye.

     Sam nods.  He goes to one of his cardboard filing boxes, pulls
     out a file, hands it to Gloria.  As she takes it, he goes to the
     closet, takes a shirt from a hanger.

                                  SAM
                  Kelly's file.  Read it.  You're going to
                  find an angry, sexually confused girl
                  who's made threats on her mother's life
                  and a female lover she'd never identify.

                                  GLORIA
                  Suzie?

     Sam shrugs.

                                  SAM
                  You're telling me Ray thinks Suzie was
                  killed.  I don't have to ask you who he
                  thinks did it, do I?
                         (beat)
                  All I'm saying is, read that, you'll
                  have a new perspective on things.

     Gloria sits on the bed, the file in her hand.  She watches as Sam
     pulls on the shirt.

                                  GLORIA
                  Why didn't you tell us about this before
                  the trial?

     Sam holds her eyes.

                                  SAM
                  Then -- I still had ethical standards to
                  protect.  They meant a lot to me.  Now,
                  I don't care.  And no amount of money
                  can buy that back.

     Sam is interrupted by the HONKING of a HORN.  He looks outside.

     ANGLE ON LOT - SAM'S POV

     A taxi waits in the glow of the green neon.

     Sam looks down on Gloria, seated on his bed, her skirt short
     enough to REVEAL shapely legs.  For a moment the two hold one
     another's eyes.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  My ride.  If you're not planning on
                  arresting me, that is.

     INT. RAY'S TRUCK - NIGHT - LATER

     The PHONE RINGS.  Ray picks it up.

                                  RAY
                  Ray.  What's happening?

     INTERCUT - RAY/GLORIA PHONE CONVERSATION

     She's still in Sam's room, the file spread across the bed.

                                  GLORIA
                  I'm tired, Ray.  I'm going home.

                  He's leaving the country.  And I don't
                  give a shit.

                                  RAY
                  The blood type on the rocks matches
                  Suzie's.

                                  GLORIA
                  It's Homicide's job now, Ray, let 'em do
                  it.  I'll tell you something else,
                  there's more to this story than you
                  know, Ray... If Suzie is dead, I think
                  Hunter may be on the right track...

     Ray clicks off his phone.

                                  GLORIA (CONT'D)
                  Ray?

                  Shit.  Ray.

     EXT. VAN RYAN ESTATE, FRONT GATE - NIGHT

     Ray gets out of his car, presses the intercom.

                                  SANDRA (V.O.)
                         (intercom)

                  Detective Duquette, Ms. Van Ryan.  Let
                  me in.  Now.

     EXT. POOL & JACUZZI - NIGHT

     Ray CROSSES the deck, Sandra at his heels.

                                  RAY
                  Where is she?

                                  SANDRA
                  Where she lives.  In the guest house.
                  Now will you tell me what this is about?

                                  RAY
                  I'm placing your daughter under arrest.

                                  SANDRA

                         (turning, cutting her
                          off)
                  Suzie Toller is dead.  You don't want
                  Kelly to be next, then take my advice.
                  Stay out of my way.

     INT. GUEST HOUSE - SAME

     A cap and gown lay strewn on the sofa.

     Kelly wears jeans and a bra.  She looks up to see Ray moving
     across the tile.  Her eyes go wide, then move to the gun case.

     EXT. GUEST HOUSE - SAME

     Sandra stands near the jacuzzi, not exactly sure what to do,
     watching as...

     ANGLE ON GUEST HOUSE - SANDRA'S POV

     Ray knocks at the French door.  It swings open.  He steps inside.

     A long moment, then VOI?ES, the SOUND of things being knocked
     about, BREAKING GLASS.

     Sandra starts toward the house then stops at the SOUND of a
     single GUNSHOT.

     A SECOND GUNSHOT follows, then a THIRD.

     The guest house door opens.  Ray stumbles out, his shoulder
     bloody, a .357 in his hand.

     VIDEOTAPE - RAY'S STATEMENT

     We SEE him from the waist up -- a white T-shirt, his shoulder
     bandaged, his arm in a sling.  There are red scratch marks on his
     face.  His eyes look blankly into the camera.

                                  RAY
                  I fucked up.  I lost control of the
                  situation, the one thing they train you
                  for... God, what did I do?

                                  HUNTER (0.S.)
                  Just tell us what happened.

                                  RAY
                  I told Kelly Van Ryan she was under
                  arrest for conspiracy and murder.  I did
                  her rights.

     EXT. CARIBBEAN BEACH RESORT - LONG SHOT - DAY

     Perfect crescent of sand.  A man in white shorts reclines in a
     beach chair, beneath a gaily-colored umbrella, sipping a drink.

     VIDEOTAPE - RAY

                                  RAY
                  Kelly went crazy, started screaming.  I
                  grabbed her, put her on the floor.

     EXT. BEACH RESORT - CLOSER SHOT - DAY

     Sam, in white shorts, looking good, watches a beautiful island
     girl in a thong bikini frolic in the surf.

     She seems to sense Sam watching, turns toward the beach.  Her
     eyes meet Sam's.  She breaks into a beautiful smile.

     VIDEOTAPE - RAY

                                  HUNTER (O.S.)
                  She bit you?

                                  RAY
                  Bit, scratched.  But I had her pinned.
                  She calmed down.  I was going to cuff
                  her... She said she thought she was
                  going to be sick.  She asked to use the
                  bathroom.

     EXT. BEACH RESORT - DAY

     Sam and the island girl sit at an outdoor table.  The girl wears
     a short, terry cloth robe, Sam the white shorts and a flowered
     shirt.  They sip drinks.  Their eyes meet.  Their fingers touch.

     VIDEOTAPE - RAY

                                  RAY
                  I told her I was coming with her.  She
                  nodded, like she understood.  We stood
                  up together.

                                  HUNTER (O.S.)
                  You didn't cuff her?

                                  RAY
                  She looked shaky, but lucid.  I thought,
                  I would just go with her, stand at the
                  door...
                         (shaking his head)
                  I think I looked away.  A split second.
                  Then, bingo.  Just like that.  She puts
                  a knee into my groin.
                         (beat)
                  There was this coffee table between us
                  and the wall.  She got one foot on that
                  thing and launched herself at the gun
                  case.  Thing had a glass door.  I could
                  hear it breaking.
                         (beat)
                  I didn't go down, but she slowed me up,
                  just enough.  Before I could get to her,
                  she'd turned on me with this small
                  caliber handgun.  I yelled at her to put
                  it down.  She got off a shot.  I took it
                  in the shoulder.  I... I had no choice.
                  I returned fire.  Two rounds, I think.
                  In the chest.

     INT. POLICE ROOM - SAME

     A moment of silence, save for the BUZZING of the MACHINE.  A
     number of plainclothes police, Hunter and Gloria among them,
     watch the tape.

                                   RAY
                  I went there to protect her...

     He hangs his head, then looks up, his eyes focusing.

                                   RAY (CONT'D)
                  The teeth, were they...

                  Suzie Toller's.  And that's the only
                  thing saving your sorry ass.

     EXT. BOAT HARBOR (CARIBBEAN ISLAND) - DAY

     Brilliant sun on turquoise water.  A few boats anchored in a
     lagoon.  A quiet place.

     Heading out -- a forty-foot sloop, Sam at the helm.

     INT. HEARING ROOM - DAY

     Gloria, Baxter, a tearful Sandra, sit in seats, watch as --

     Ray stands before a panel, A SUIT, A CHIEF in uniform, Hunter.

     Ray wears a suit, his hair neatly trimmed.  His arm is no longer
     in a sling, but one of his hands is still bandaged.

                                  CHIEF
                  Detective Duquette; our investigation
                  concludes that this was a good shooting.
                  But that's irrelevant.  You were not
                  assigned to this case -- whatever you
                  imagined this case to be.  And now two
                  young women are dead.  You are
                  terminated with forfeiture of pension
                  and benefits.

     Ray looks at the floor.

     Hunter coughs.  His hands rest on a file -- we SEE the video
     cassette inside -- labeled "TOLLER/VAN RYAN -- CONFIDENTIAL."

                                  HUNTER
                  Suzie Toller's teeth and blood were
                  found near the area known as Stoner
                  Rocks.  Suzie's blood was found in the
                  Van Ryan Range Rover.  This, in
                  conjunction with evidence obtained by
                  Detectives Duquette and Perez has led
                  this office to the conclusion that Susan
                  Marie Toller was murdered by Kelly
                  Lanier Van Ryan...

     Sandra chokes back a sob.  She gets to her feet, to be led from
     the room by Tom Baxter.

     Gloria Perez watches, a sad look in her eye, then turns to look
     at Ray.  His back is to her -- the broad shoulders, expensive
     suit.  His hands are clasped behind his back.

     EXT. BLUE BAY CEMETERY - KELLY'S FUNERAL - DAY

     Gloria stands among a considerable number of mourners.  She is
     just back from Sandra and Tom Baxter, who, in turn, are just back
     from the open grave.

     As Gloria watches, Sandra looks off to the side, where something
     catches her eye.  Gloria sees her start, then follows her gaze.

     ANGLE ON CEMETERY - GLORIA'S POV

     On a rise some fifty yards from the Van Ryan plot, two people
     stand near an old oak -- Ruby and Walter.

     When Gloria looks back at Sandra, it seems to her as if the woman
     has slumped against Tom Baxter, who now stares at the two people
     on the rise as if, by doing so with sufficient intensity, he
     might make them disappear.

     Gloria turns to the grave site, her eye lingers on the open
     grave, then moves to the huge marker which dominates the Van Ryan
     family plot and, in fact, the entire scene.

     ANGLE CN MARKER

     The angel Gabriel, trumpet in hand, carved in relief upon a huge
     obelisk of black marble.  Beneath the angel is a carved scroll
     and upon it the words:

     "I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE," and below that:  "WILLIAM
     TECUMSEH VAN RYAN.  MAY HE REST IN PEACE."

     EXT. A BEACH - NIGHT

     Sam Lombardo walks along a moonlit lagoon, headed toward a lone
     bungalow.

     The bungalow is simple, picturesque -- whitewashed walls, a
     thatched roof.  A patio opens onto the beach.

     EXT. PATIO - SAME

     As Sam steps in off the sand, he sees something and stops short.

     Wet spots lead toward the bungalow.

     Sam listens.  Everything is quiet.

     INT. BUNGALOW - SAME

     Sam ENTERS in a room lit only by the blue light of a large
     aquarium.  He listens once more, hears it -- RUNNING WATER.

     He moves down a short hallway, observes the light which spills
     from beneath a bedroom door.  He pushes it open, goes inside.

     INT. BEDROOM - SAME

     He CROSSES the room.

     The bathroom door is ajar, the room leaking steam.

     INT. BATHROOM - SAME

     Sam steps inside, looks at the shower stall -- an indistinct
     shape moves there in the steam.

     San watches, then jerks open the shower door.  The steam
     clears -- REVEALING a tall, athletic body, and now the face --

     Ray Duquette, grinning at Sam out of the swirling steam.

                                  RAY
                  Buy you a drink?

     San takes a step back.

                                  SAM
                  Jesus.  I wasn't expecting you 'til
                  tomorrow.

     Ray turns off the water, steps out of the stall, wrapping himself
     in a towel.  There's a fresh, raised scar across one shoulder and
     Ray winces a little as he tucks the towel about his waist.  He
     looks at himself in the mirror, touching the scar.

                                  RAY
                  Nice girlfriend you had there.

     Sam just looks at him.

                                  SAM
                  Yeah, well, you fixed that.
                         (beat)
                  What the hell happened, anyway?

                                  RAY
                  The bitch shot me, is what happened.

     Sam shakes his head, walks back into the bedroom.  Ray follows.

                                  RAY (CCNT'D)
                  Hey, what did you want me to do, die?

                                  SAM
                  Well, shit, you're the cop, they don't
                  teach you to disarm people, shoot them
                  in the leg or something?  You weren't
                  supposed to kill her for Christ's sake.

     Now Ray just looks at Sam, his eyes narrowing.

                                  RAY
                  Did you become squeamish about these
                  things before or after you bludgeoned
                  little Suzie Toller to death with a wine
                  bottle?
                         (off Sam's silence)
                  Jesus, man.
                  It couldn't have worked out better.
                  They're convinced Kelly whacked Suzie.
                  I can't talk 'em out of it.
                         (beat)
                  We should be celebrating.  This thing
                  worked out just like you said, only
                  better.

                                  SAM
                  Kelly was supposed to be framed, not
                  killed.
                         (beat)
                  What I'm telling you is, I don't like
                  surprises.

     Ray walks to a dresser where a bottle of champagne sits in a
     bucket of ice.  He opens the bottle, fills two glasses.  He hands
     one of the glasses to Sam.

                                  RAY
                  Every cloud has a silver lining,
                  partner.  Here's to no loose ends.

     He raises his glass in a toast.

     Sam looks at it, then raises his glass as well.  Ray smiles.  Sam
     doesn't.

                                  SAM
                  Here's to no more surprises.

     Ray shrugs.  The two men's eyes meet.  They touch glasses and
     drink.

     EXT. SMALL BOAT HARBOR (ISLAND) - DAY

     Sam and Ray work on the deck of Sam's sloop, stowing gear,
     loading supplies.

     The boat's mast shines in the sunlight before a brilliant sky.
     Palms sway.  The men work in silence.

     EXT. SMILIN' JACK'S FISH CAMP - DAY

     Gloria drives up in the white Taurus.  She parks before the
     ramshackle old building and the gator pen.

     Walter is in the pen.  Ruby stands just outside of it.  She looks
     toward the road as Gloria gets out, then back to the pen.

     Gloria comes down the bank to stand beside Ruby.  She's just in
     time to see the huge old reptile raise itself, hissing, on its
     front legs, jaws sprung wide.  The women watch as Walter sticks
     his arm into the gator's mouth.

                                  RUBY
                  Gator can't see what's in front of it
                  for shit.  They see out the sides.
                         (beat)
                  That one don't even know Walter's arm's
                  in his mouth.

                                  GLORIA
                  What if something distracts it and it
                  snaps anyway?

                                  RUBY
                  Then I guess Walter can kiss that arm of
                  his goodbye.
                         (loud enough for Walter
                          to hear)
                  He don't use it for no good deeds
                  anyway.

     Walter looks at the ladies, picks up the stick and sweeps it
     between the gaping jaws, which snap in its wake.

                                  RUBY (CONT'D)
                  You come all the way out here to watch
                  Walter?

                                  GLORIA
                  I was wondering if I could ask you a few
                  questions.

                                  RUBY
                  About Suzie?

                                  GLORIA
                  Actually, I was wondering if I might ask
                  you about Ray Duquette.

                                  RUBY
                         (a long beat)
                  He used to come around here.  He had a
                  thing going with one of the girls over
                  at the Glades.

     Ruby nods toward the motel, a bitter smile on her face.

                                  RUBY (CONT'D)
                  Got sort of hung up on her, from what
                  hear.

                                  GLORIA
                  She still work there?

                                  RUBY
                  No.  Not after that night.
                         (a long beat)
                  I don't know what happened.  Maybe he
                  caught her with some john...
                  All I know is, the next morning the girl
                  was gone and there was a dead boy...
                  Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live
                  down the road there in a wrecked car.
                  Him and Suzie were at the Glades that
                  night.
                         (beat)
                  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie
                  busted and sent her away.  That's what
                  there is to say about Ray Duquette.

                                  GLORIA
                  Was there ever any kind of
                  investigation...

     Ruby cuts her off with a short laugh.

                                  RUBY
                  Duquette always claimed the kid was
                  dusted, came after him with a knife.
                  But it was Jack's Fish Camp... This
                  could be the moon for all most people
                  care.
                         (a long beat)
                  Wasn't supposed to be like that though.
                  This place was supposed to be something
                  once.  There were going to be roads and
                  houses.  There was going to be a town.
                  They were going to call it Salt Creek.

     EXT. OCEAN - DAY

     From the surface of the sea -- the emerald island in the
     distance.  The bow of the sloop comes INTO FRAME.

     On board -- Sam stands in the cockpit, at the helm.  Ray lounges
     on the deck.  The boat sails easily before the wind.

                                  SAM
                  Ray... you see that winch by your head?
                  Take a couple of turns on it for me,
                  she's luffing.

     Ray cranes his neck to look at the winch.

                                  RAY
                  You mean this thing?

                                  SAM
                  Yes, we call it a winch.
                         (pointing at pieces of
                          the rigging)
                  And these are shrouds, and these are
                  stays.

                                  RAY
                  I thought this was supposed to be a
                  vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big
                  power boat?

                                  SAM
                  Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of
                  you yet.

                                  RAY
                  Yeah, or get me drowned.

     Ray kneels.  He begins to tighten the winch.

     Sam watches him for a moment, then reaches around behind his back
     to unhook the short line which holds the boom.

     The mainsail catches wind, swinging the boom in a wide arc,
     directly at Ray.

     Ray looks up, sees it coming just in time to catch it on his arm.

     The blow is enough to send him sprawling through the lifelines,
     where he just manages to grab one of the nylon cords.

     Sam ducks as the boon continues to swing erratically above the
     deck, watching as Ray hauls himself on board.

     The boat no longer driven by the wind, bobs up and down on a
     small ground swell.

     The two men face each other.

                                  SAM
                  Jesus, man... You okay?

                                  RAY
                  That how you planned it?  You take cut
                  Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then
                  dump me in the ocean...

                                  SAM
                  Come off it, man... It was an accident.

     Ray nods, then reaches down, pulls off the winch handle and
     starts with it toward Sam.

     Sam looks around.  He jerks open a storage compartment.  A
     diver's weight belt tumbles out.  Sam grabs it, swings it over
     his head in circles, letting the weight pick up momentum,
     preparing to throw.

     Ray crouches, still brandishing the winch handle.  The boom
     sweeps the deck.

     Sam throws the belt.

     Ray grabs a shroud, dances out of the way, then steadies himself,
     a mean grin spreading across his face.

     There's no tine for Sam to look for anything else.

     Ray moves quickly across the deck -- a menacing sight -- tall,
     well-muscled, the handle gleaming in his hand.

     Sam pulls himself out of the cockpit.  Ray jumps in.  But that's
     as far as he gets.

     WHOOSH -- A spear pierces Ray's thigh.  He screams, goes down,
     the handle skittering across the deck.

     Ray follows it with his eyes, reaching out, then freezing as he
     sees something else.  He draws in his hand as if bitten.

                                  RAY
                  You... You're...

     He scuttles backward, pulling himself onto the deck, clutching at
     his leg which squirts blood as if an artery has been severed.
     But his eyes never leave the hatchway leading belowdecks.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  You're dead... for godsake...

     The boat heels over.  The spear in Ray's thigh bangs against the
     edge of the cockpit.  He grimaces in pain as...

     Suzie Toller steps up from belowdecks.  She's wearing a bikini
     and showing a nice tan.  She's carrying Sam's new spear gun, a
     fresh spear at the ready.

                                  SUZIE
                  Rumors of my demise have been greatly
                  exaggerated.
                         (to Sam)
                  Nice move.  Good thing I was here to
                  save your incompetent ass.

     Sam secures the boom.  Ray stares at Suzie, his face twisted with
     some combination of pain, rage and fear.

                                  RAY
                  You... I should've killed you myself.
                  should never have left it up to him...

                                  SUZIE
                  Shoulda, coulda, woulda...
                         (to Sam)
                  Get him in the water.

     San starts for Ray.

                                  RAY
                  Sam, for Christ's sake...

     Sam's feet slide in the bloody smear.  He stops.

     Ray clings to a safety line.

                                  SAM
                  I can't.

     WHOOSH -- A second spear penetrates Ray's shoulder.  He loses his
     grip.  The boat heels over, dumping Ray into the water.

     Suzie puts down her spear gun.  She goes to a storage locker,
     takes out a bait bucket.  She steps up on the deck.

     Ray is floating not far from the boat, the water going red around
     him.  He calls out...

                                  RAY
                  Sam, for godsake.

                                  SUZIE
                  Hey, Ray.  Guess whose name is on the
                  numbered bank account besides yours and
                  Sam's?

     She raises the bucket, heaves bloody chum into the water.

                                  SUZIE (CONT'D)
                  I like these joint survivorship
                  accounts.  Something unfortunate happens
                  to one of the signatories, the others
                  don't have to worry.  Are you worrying,
                  Ray?

     She heaves more chum -- a big red slurp across Ray's face.

     Ray gasps, goes under, thrashing around in the red slick.

                                  SUZIE (CONT'D)
                  Men, use 'em abuse 'em lose 'em.

     INSERT - SHARKS

     from underwater, in a frenzy, rip a human body into a bloody
     cloud.

     EXT. SAILBOAT - LATER

     Suzie cones up from below with a champagne bottle and glasses,
     already filled.

                                  SUZIE
                  Feeling better?

     Sam gazes out to sea.

                                  SAM
                  That was about as grim as it gets.

                                  SUZIE
                  The guy was history when he killed
                  Kelly.  You knew that.

                                  SAM
                  But then you knew what he was like all
                  along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a
                  thing you had counted on...

                                  SUZIE
                  But then it is better this way, don't
                  you think?  No loose ends.

     Sam just looks at her.

                                  SUZIE (CONT'D)
                  What?

                                  SAM
                  That was the same thing Ray said.

     Suzie smiles -- showing the big gap where her two front teeth
     used to be.

                                  SUZIE
                  Poor Ray.
                         (a beat)
                  Come on Sam, we did it.  We put the
                  screws to the Van Ryans.  We won.

     She hands a glass to Sam, takes the other.  He puts it to his
     lips, suddenly hesitates, thinks, sniffs the glass.

     A moment.  Suzie shakes her head.

                                  SUZIE (CONT'D)
                  Talk about paranoid.  Now are you gonna
                  teach me to sail this big old boat or
                  not?

     Sam downs his drink.

                                  SAM
                  Okay.  Grab that winch there.

     Suzie gives him a pouty look.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  What's wrong?

                                  SUZIE
                  Fuck the winch.  I wanna drive.

     Sam sighs.

                                  SAM
                  Okay.  Come here and take the helm.
                  I'll get the winch.

     Suzie gives him her best, gap-toothed smile, then comes forward
     to take the gleaming chrome wheel, as Sam scrambles up on deck,
     kneeling where Ray had kneeled before him to set the jib.

     Suzie watches -- a long beat, then, slowly reaches behind her,
     unhooking the line which holds the boom...

     ANGLE ON BOOM

     sweeping the deck -- coming right at us, blotting out the sky.

     EXT. SMILING JACK'S - SUZIE'S ROOM - DAY

     Gloria sits on Suzie's bed, books spread out around her.  Ruby
     stands beside her.

                                  RUBY
                  You asked if Suzie knew about the Salt
                  Creek land deal?  Girl read every book
                  she could find on it, the Van Ryans too.

     Ruby takes a photo album from among the books, opens it, tosses a
     photograph on the bed.  It is one we have seen before.

     ANGLE ON PHOTO

     A stately old gentleman in a three-piece suit.  White hair, a
     white handlebar mustache.  A derby on his knee, a walking stick
     at his side.  He stares out at the world from a high-backed
     wicker chair, flanked by potted palms and two small terriers.

     Across the bottom of the picture is the name -- "WILLIAM TECUMSEH
     VAN RYAN."  And beside that, in another hand -- "Dear old Dad."

                                  RUBY
                  Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy
                  the people who invested here.  He got to
                  be old, he and his rich cronies would
                  come down here, hunt and whore, act like
                  assholes.  One trip he showed up with
                  this young girl he'd picked up
                  somewhere, gotten her pregnant then
                  dumped her in the swamp.
                         (indicating the photo)
                  That came with her.

                                  GLORIA
                  And the child...

                                  RUBY
                  She had it, before she drank herself to
                  death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...

                                  GLORIA
                  Suzie.
                         (beat)
                  Then you're not her grandmother...

                                  RUBY
                  Raised her like she was, but no,
                  Walter's my only child.

                  He was a good boy, till the army took
                  him.

     Gloria looks once more at the old photograph.

                                  GLORIA
                  So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half-
                  sisters.

                                  RUBY
                  And the other girl, Kelly.  Suzie's
                  niece.

     Gloria stands, a little weary.  Ruby walks her from the room.

                                  GLORIA
                  Thank you for talking to me, Ruby.  I am
                  sorry about Suzie, she...

     They have gotten to the main room and Gloria stops short,
     noticing for the first time that the beat-up old black-and-white
     TV has been replaced by a high-tech, giant-screen television.

                                  RUBY
                  You okay?

                                  GLORIA
                  I'm fine.  Nice TV.

     The old lady nods, walks her outside.

     EXT. SMILIN' JACK'S FISH CAMP - DAY

     The dusty road, the little dock, the gator pen.

                                  RUBY
                  There's an old saying from the
                  Everglades -- virtue may be missed but
                  sin can't hide.
                         (a long beat)
                  Folks pay in the end.

     Gloria nods.  She is distracted by a movement in the gator pen.

     CLOSE ON PEN

     For a moment there is nothing more than a few ripples across the
     surface of the pond which lies inside the pen, then, slowly, the
     GATOR'S EYES -- cold, reptilian, unblinking, rising up to gaze
     across the oily waters.

                                                 HARD CUT TO:

     INTERCUT - LIKE OUTTAKES...

     ALL, in reverse chronological order.

     INT. GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT

     Kelly is frantically trying to unlock the gun case as Ray comes
     through the French doors.  She can't get it done.  He's there in
     an instant.

     She screams, backs away, then watches as Ray stops, wraps a hanky
     around his hand and breaks the glass.

     He takes out a small caliber handgun, checks the clip, aims the
     gun at his own shoulder and fires.

     BLACK -- MORE CREDITS -- then

     EXT. EVERGLADES - DAY

     A Jeep and a truck parked in the mud.  Sam and Ray meet under
     heavy, moss-draped cypress.  Sam hands Ray a plastic bag -- the
     teeth.

                                  SAM
                  You know the place I'm talking about --

     EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

     SAM & SUZIE

     behind the big rocks.  He's got vise-grip pliers jammed in her
     mouth.  Suzie moans, for real.  He loosens his grip.

                                  SUZIE
                  You've got the pressure too tight.
                  You'll crush the fucking evidence.

     Sam takes a breath, prepares to try again.  Suzie pops a couple
     of pills with gulps of wine.  Sam goes to it once more.

     BLACK -- MORE CREDITS -- then

     INT. SAM'S HOUSE - DAY

     Kelly and Sam on the floor, naked.  He's on her from the rear.
     It's getting wild.  He suddenly stops, rolls to the floor.

                                  SAM
                  We gotta stop.  I'm gonna come.

     Kelly laughs, straddles him.

                                  KELLY
                  That never seemed to worry you at the
                  Glades.

                                  SAM
                  That's not your line.

                                  KELLY
                  Say you love me.

                                  SAM
                         (a beat)
                  I love you.  Now give me the line.

                                  KELLY
                         (a whiny voice)
                  No little girl can ever make me come.

     EXT. THE GLADES MOTEL - NIGHT

     Suzie's VW is parked across the street, in the shadows of tall
     trees.  She and Sam sit inside, watching as...

     Ray Duquette EXITS a bungalow, a sport coat over his arm.  He
     heads for Jim's Recovery Room.  In another moment, a young hooker
     in a leather miniskirt walks out of the same bungalow.

                                  SUZIE
                  Seems to like some of the same places
                  you do.  Funny you never met.

                                  SAM
                  Yeah, real funny.  You're wrong about
                  this, I could get busted on the spot.

                                  SUZIE
                  Trust me, the guy's dirty.  He'll like
                  it.  Especially the part about offing
                  me.
                         (beat)
                  Now get out of here.  Go make yourself a
                  new friend.

     INT. JIM'S RECOVERY ROOM - NIGHT

     Ray is at the bar.  Sam sits down next to him.  A moment of
     silence, the twang of a country JUKE BOX -- then...

                                  SAM
                  Buy you a drink?

     ZNT. SAM'S OFFICE - BLUE BAY SCHOOL

     Suzie Toller framed in the doorway.  She walks in.

                                  SUZIE
                  You like bein' a caddy for rich kids'
                  problems?

     Sam just looks at her.

                                  SUZIE (CONT'D)
                  I've seen you out there in your old air
                  boat, thinking about what might have
                  been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you
                  out of it.
                         (beat)
                  What if I told you I had a way we could
                  get a big piece of it back?

                                  SAM
                  We?

                                  SUZIE
                  Well, I'd need the famous Lombardo
                  charm, not that you'd have to do
                  anything you haven't done already.

     She takes an envelope from her notebook, tosses it in front of
     Sam.  Pictures slide onto his desk -- Sam and Kelly -- in various
     poses of coked-out debauchery at the Glades Motel.

                                  SAM
                         (white-faced)

                                  SUZIE
                  Walter.  He's been aimin' that Brownie
                  through knotholes for years.  I saw
                  these, I knew he'd finally struck gold.
                         (beat)
                  I can't decide which came out better,
                  that little straw Kelly's got up her
                  nose, or that vibrator you've got up her
                  ass.  What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?

                                  SAM
                         (a long beat)
                  I think there's some things you do, you
                  don't want to see yourself doing them.

     INT. JIM'S RECOVERY ROOM - DAY

     Sam lounges in a booth.  He looks hot, bored.  He stirs a drink.
     Kelly walks in out of the light.  She is looking a little strung
     out, a big straw bag slung over one shoulder, but oh, so sexy in
     skimpy cutoffs and cowboy boots -- long legs flashing as she
     nears Sam's booth.  Sam looks up, as...

                                  KELLY
                  I'm running away.

                         (a beat)
                  You think that's wise?

                         (sitting next to him)
                  Um-huh.  And guess what else?
                         (reaching into her bag)
                  I have toys.

     She takes out a snail bag of white powder, taps out a line on the
     table top.

     Sam looks at it.  He looks at Kelly.  He's had a few drinks.

                                  SAM
                         (a long beat)
                  Well, Z guess one taste wouldn't hurt.

     The seal comes up.  It's over.  They head for the lobby -- but --

     EXT. SMILIN' JACK'S FISH CAMP - LATE AFTERNOON

     Gloria stands beneath the jawbones, looking toward the channel as
     the shadows lengthen across the dirt road.

     ANGLE ON CHANNEL

     Walter hangs a "FOR SALE" sign on a small, shabby sloop.

     Gloria CROSSES the road.

                  Selling your boat?

     Walter shoots her a look.

                                  WALTER
                  This was Suzie's boat.  Guess she won't
                  be needin' it.

                                  GLORIA
                  I wouldn't have guessed Suzie was a
                  sailor.

     Walter finishes with the sign.

                                  WALTER
                  Old lady had her tested once.  They said
                  her IQ was way up there, round two
                  hundred or some such shit.
                         (beat)
                  That girl could do just about anything,
                  she put her mind to it.

     Gloria has nothing to say.  She stares at the little sloop
     bobbing in the muddy water of the swamp.

     EXT. THE CARIBBEAN - WIDE ANGLE - SEA LEVEL - DAY

     A head bobs among the groundswells.

     CLOSE - SAM LOMBARDO

     sucking wind through a smashed face, struggling to stay afloat,
     as...

     ... in the distance, the sloop races toward a far horizon.

     EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY

     A place of money and privilege.  White coral buildings surround
     an open yard.  Tile roofs rise among banyan trees and banana
     palms, shimmering before a blue blaze of sky.

     Beyond the yard is the school's playing field and beyond that the
     waters of Biscayne Bay, dappled in sunlight where the sloops of
     the school's sailing class bob at their moorings.

     For a moment all is quiet.  Then, faintly, the HUM of many
     VOICES, rising and falling, LAUGHTER.

     The CAMERA PANS to the open windows of a building somewhat larger
     than the others.  The SOUNDS grow louder.

     INT. BLUE BAY AUDITORIUM - DAY

     A hundred high school kids sit before a raised, hardwood stage.
     The students are not unlike the campus, radiant, well-tended -- a
     veritable sea of adolescent sexuality -- bronze boys who seem to
     have just come from the boats or tennis courts -- girls in tight
     shorts riding high up shapely thighs, as...

     SAM LOMBARDO strolls out onto the stage.  The man is thirtyish,
     drop-dead handsome.  Dressed not that differently from the kids,
     in an Izod polo shirt, khakis and boat shoes.

     His entrance has an effect upon the audience, particularly upon
     the girls.

     KAREN and JANELLE, 16, pretty blondes, whisper then giggle.

     NICOLE, a dark-eyed beauty, 17 but going on 25, watches Sam's
     walk, then turns to the girl at her side...

     KELLY VAN RYAN, 17, a fully-developed knockout.

                                  NICOLE
                  When we graduate the only thing I'm
                  going to miss is...
                         (with a nod to the stage)
                  Know what I mean?

     Kelly's eyes are locked on Sam.  Nicole has to nudge her.

                                  NICOLE (CONT'D)
                  Kelly?

                                  KELLY
                         (still staring)
                  Oh yeah.

     Sam is at the podium.  He looks out across the audience.  There
     are a couple of flirtatious whistles, laughter.  Sam smiles,
     silencing them with a wave of his hand.

                                  SAM
                  We've come to the halfway point in my
                  senior seminars...

     Cheers, applause.  Sam waits for the kids to settle.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  Come on.  Beats study hall, doesn't it?

                                  JIMMY (O.S.)
                  No!

     Boos as we FIND...

     JIMMY LEACH, 18, grumge look, long hair.  He sits with a clique
     of white trashy types, or at least what passes for such at Blue
     Bay School.  Jimmy appears a bit more genuine, as does...

     SUZlE TOLLER, a boyish brunette, seated nearby, but with just
     enough space between her and everyone else to mark her as a
     loner.  She studies Sam Lombardo with a dark, sullen stare.

                                  SAM
                  Thank you, Jimmy.

                                  JIMMY
                  Hey, man, at least in study hail I could
                  meditate.

                                  KIRK (O.S.)
                  He means masturbate...

     This remark is greeted by a chorus of laughter as we FIND...

     KIRK, one of the golden boys, seated with Kelly and Nicole.

                                  SAM
                  Something Kirk with which I'm sure you
                  have hands-on experience.

     Loud laughter.  Sam quiets them again, then turns to the
     blackboard, where he begins to write, in big letters -- S-E-X.
     The kids start to cheer.

     Sam writes another word -- C-R-I-M-E-S.

     The cheering fades into silence.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  We've all heard the words, date rape,
                  sexual harassment.  We've talked about
                  some of these things in this room.

                         (beat)
                  They're here to give you what we hope
                  will be a fresh perspective on these
                  subjects, and to answer any questions
                  you night have.

     Sam turns to the wings, his hand out to welcome the visitors...

     RAY DUQUETTE, mid-thirties, with the lanky build of a light
     heavyweight, walks out onto the stage.  He's dressed in a dark
     suit, dark hair combed straight back above steel-rimmed glasses.

     GLORIA PEREZ walks at his side.  She's a good six inches shorter
     than Ray, with a sweet face.  Attractive but no stunner.

     About five kids applaud.  Ray takes the podium.

                                  RAY
                  Thank you for having us.  We'll each
                  talk for ten or fifteen minutes, then
                  open it up to your questions...

     IN THE AUDIENCE

     Suzie Toller suddenly gets to her feet.  As she passes behind
     Jimmy, we HEAR her VOICE, beneath her breath.

                                  SUZIE
                  I'm not going to listen to this
                  jack-off.

     She marches down the aisle and bangs out the rear door..

     Ray pauses, a dark look on his face, then goes on...

                                  RAY
                  Let's begin with a question.  What is a
                  sex crime?

     A moment.

                                  JIMMY
                  Not getting any.

     This draws a few laughs from the kids, a couple of thin smiles
     from Sam and Gloria.  And none at all from Ray Duquette.

     EXT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

     The kids change classes.  Sam, Ray and Gloria CROSS the grass.
     The kids swarm past.  A pair of girls flash by.

                                  CAROLE
                  Have a nice weekend, Mr. Lombardo.

                                  SAM

                  Hey, Carole, you too.  And be good.

                                  CAROLE
                         (beneath a pouty look)
                  I hate to be good.

     The three adults ENTER an old wooden building.

     INT. BUILDING - DAY

                                  SAM
                  This is one of the original buildings.
                  We have the offices here now.

     The walls are paneled in wood, decorated with framed photographs.
     Gloria stops before one of the photos.

     ANGLE ON PHOTOGRAPH

     An old black-and-white, with that sepia caste harkening back to
     another age.

     A handsome young man of perhaps 14 stands at the helm of a boat
     under sail.  His hair is swept back, his eyes fixed upon an
     unseen horizon.  There is something in this boy's pose, in the
     line of his jaw, in the clarity of his gaze, as if what he has
     fixed upon is the future itself.

                                  GLORIA
                  Anybody in particular?

     When no one answers, she turns to find Sam at her side.  He
     stares at the picture, then looks at Gloria.

                                  SAM
                  Sam Lombardo.  The first.  Class of
                  'Forty-Two
                         (beat)
                  My father.

     Gloria does a slow double-take, looking from Sam to the photo and
     back again.

                                  VOICE (0.S.)
                  Can't seem to get rid of the Lombardos
                  around here.

     Sam and the detectives turn as a professorial-looking guy in a
     baggy brown suit (ART MADDOX) arrives on the scene.

                                  SAM
                  Art.  Say hello to Detectives Perez and
                  Duquette.
                         (to the cops)
                  Art Maddox. A fellow guidance counselor.

     Art and the detectives shake hands.

                                  ART
                  So, did you set 'em all straight on the
                  ugly facts of life?

                                  SAM
                  I have the feeling, they got it down
                  already.  They're a step ahead of us,
                  Artie.

     Gloria seems to find this amusing.  Ray stands at her side, looks
     at Sam.  Sam feels it, makes eye contact with Ray -- a beat -- at
     which point, Ray puts a hand on Gloria's back.

                                  RAY
                  I've got that two o'clock in town.

                                  GLORIA
                         (nodding)
                  Back to the land of grownups.

     The detectives shake hands once more with San and Art.

                                  SAM
                         (to Gloria)
                  If old pictures interest you, come back
                  some time, there's quite a collection
                  down in the pagoda.  I'll see you get a
                  proper tour.

                                  GLORIA
                         (smiling)
                  I'd like that.

     Ray opens a door for her.  The detectives pass through it.

     Art claps Sam on the shoulder, then walks off down the hallway.
     Sam remains near the doors, watching as...

     ANGLE ON THE DRIVE LEADING TO THE SCHOOL

     Ray and Gloria walk past half a dozen expensive cars -- Range
     Rovers, Beamers and Mercedes, to a plain, white Ford Taurus,
     which they get into and drive away.

     EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL - LATER

     Cheerleaders perform a sensual dance on the porch of a wooden
     pagoda.  A rugby team runs drills on the grass, as out on the
     bay, six tiny racing sloops tack toward the docks.

     ANGLE ON DOCKS

     As the sloops enter the narrow channel between the slips one
     student from each boat jumps onto the dock where he or she sets
     about tying off the boat.

     Sam is on one of the boats.  Jimmy Leach is at the rudder.

                                  SAM
                         (loud enough to be heard
                          by his class)
                  Okay, you guys.  Good work.  Now coil
                  those dock lines and I'll see you all on
                  Monday.

     He watches his class clamber up the docks.  His eye falls upon
     the pagoda, the dancing cheerleaders -- Kelly Van Ryan in
     work-out tights -- bare arms reaching for the sky.

     EXT. SCHOOL DOCKS - SAM & JIMMY - LATER

     hosing down boats, stowing sails.  They look up as...
     A HUGE POWER BOAT glides past.  The docks rock in its wake.

                                  JIMMY
                  All right.  I could party on that.

     Sam just laughs at him.

                                  SAM
                  That's about all it's good for.
                         (beat)
                  That's the one to have.

     He points to a beautiful triple-masted schooner headed out of the
     bay, under sail.

                                  SAM
                  The Windward Passage.  I crewed on that
                  one summer.
                         (beat)
                  Long time ago.

     He pulls his eyes from the boat, sets about coiling a line.

                                  JIMMY
                  You know, I want to thank you for
                  getting me into this class...  No way was
                  my old man going to spring for the
                  fees...

                                  SAM
                  Hey, you're working for it.
                         (beneath a laugh)
                  Least you're supposed to be.

     He tosses Jimmy the coiled line.  Jimmy's caught off-guard, but
     catches it at the last second, then shares the laugh with Sam.

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                  Can I play too?  Or is it just for boys?

     Sam and Jimmy turn to find Kelly Van Ryan at the far end of the
     dock.  She's fresh from cheerleader practice, in a white blouse
     knotted at the bottom to REVEAL a flat, tanned stomach; open at
     the top to REVEAL the swelling of her breasts.  She favors Sam
     with a coy smile.

                                  KELLY
                  So who's washing your car this weekend,
                  Mr. Lombardo?
                         (off Sam's blank look)
                  The senior car wash, remember?
                         (beat)
                  Tamara's making a schedule.  She said
                  you bought a coupon but you're not on
                  anybody's list.

     Sam smiles, remembering.

                                  SAM
                  Well, you know.  Figured I'd buy a
                  Washing ticket, support the effort.
                  That old Jeep of mine's kind of a waste
                  of time, don't you think?

     Sam places the coiled hose on top of a locker then starts up the
     dock, Jimmy at his side.  Kelly falls in with then.

                                  KELLY
                  Not at all.  How about if Nicole and I
                  do it?  We're working as a team.

     Sam just looks at her.  She looks back -- big, pleading eyes.

                                  SAM
                  Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out
                  to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys
                  can wash the mud off.

                                  KELLY
                  Deal.
                         (beat)
                  You know, I just looked out front.  My
                  ride wasn't there.  You suppose you
                  could give me one?

     Sam doesn't answer right away.  He looks toward the school.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  You wouldn't want me to walk, would you?
                  I mean like, something bad might happen.

     Sam hesitates, momentarily at a loss, then turns to Jimmy, who
     seems to regard Kelly with something akin to physical pain.

                                  SAM
                  What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?

                                  JIMMY
                         (still looking at Kelly)
                  What?

                                  SAM
                  A ride.  You want one?

                                 JIMMY
                  Yeah.  But I got my bike.

     EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY

     Sam's Jeep rolls out of the drive, Jimmy's bike in back, meaning
     that Jimmy and Kelly are squeezed into the passenger seat, which
     is fine with Jimmy.  Kelly's thigh is pressed against his.  His
     arm pushes against her breast.  Kelly is not so happy.

     As they near the school's entrance, they come upon a beat-to-shit
     VW bug -- stalled at a stop sign.

     A John Deere tractor mower sits nearby.  A groundsman -- a tall
     black guy with a shaved head, waits at the wheel of the bug as...

     Suzie Toller -- in black platform shoes, a T-shirt and cutoff
     jeans, leans over the engine, fiddling with the car's linkage.

     Sam pulls up next to the bug and stops.

                                  SAM
                  We got room for one more, Suzie.  You
                  need a ride?

     Kelly rolls her eyes as Suzie turns to look at them.

                                  KELLY
                  Jesus.  Where'd she get those shoes?
                  Whores-4-Less?

     Suzie's eyes go cold.  She signals the groundsman, who turns the
     key.  The CAR SPLUTTERS to life.  Suzie flashes a smile, then
     sticks out her tongue -- which has been pierced by a silver stud.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  That's cute.

     Suzie gives her the finger.  Sam makes eye contact with Suzie,
     offers a sad smile, while putting the Jeep in gear.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                         (to Suzie)
                  I hope you swallow it.

     Jimmy turns, waving to Suzie as the Jeep pulls away.

     EXT. UPSCALE NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

     Magnificent old mansions occupy five-acre bay-front parcels amid
     lush, tropical settings.

     Sam's Jeep stops before a pair of gates with the words "VAN RYAN"
     woven into their wrought-iron design.  Beyond the gates a long
     drive leads toward a huge stone house.  Kelly jumps out, punches
     in a code.  The gates swing open.

                                  KELLY
                  Don't forget the car wash.

                                  SAM
                  I won't.

     SANDRA VAN RYAN, Kelly's mom, big, sexy, aggressive, a young 42
     in a string bikini, comes out from the side of the house.  When
     she sees the Jeep, she starts down the drive.

     Kelly waves to Sam, then walks up the drive.  When she sees her
     mother coming toward her, her face hardens.

                                  SANDRA
                  Is that Sam Lombardo?

                                  KELLY
                         (sarcastic)
                  Hi, Mon.

                                  SANDRA
                  Sam!  Hi!

     Sam has already hung a U.

     Sandra comes through the gate and up to the Jeep.

     Jimmy is checking her out.  All eyes.

                                  SANDRA (CONT'D)
                         (to Sam; as if Jimmy
                          wasn't even there)
                  What?  You're going to drive off without
                  even saying hi?

                                  SAM
                  Hi, Sandy.

                                  SANDRA
                  Why don't you come in, have a drink?

                                  SAM
                  Can't.  Got a passenger.

     Sandra looks down her nose at Jimmy.

                                  SANDRA
                  He can wait.

     Sam glances past her, to Kelly, who stands languidly at the front
     of the house, watching.

                                  SAM
                  I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run.

                                  SANDRA
                  I'll bet.
                         (then, softening)
                  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this
                  weekend.  We'll take the boat out...

                                  SAM
                         (cutting her off)
                  Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.

                                  SANDRA
                  What?  Running over alligators with that
                  silly swamp jalopy when you could be
                  sailing a real boat...

                                  SAM
                  Swamp's where it's at, Sandy.  Gives you
                  a look into the muck we all crawled out
                  of.  You ought to try it some time.

     Sandra gives him a hard stare, then marches off toward the house.

     CLOSE ON KELLY

     still at the door, a cold smile on her face.

                                                 FADE TO:

     EXT. SUBURBAN CUL-DE-SAC - DAY

     Neat little stucco houses -- some not so neat -- simmer in
     tropical heat.

     A BMW Z-3 Roadster stops at the head of the cul-de-sac.  Nicole
     is driving.  Kelly sits beside her.

                                  NICOLE
                  This is it?

     Kelly looks at a pad of paper, nods.

                                  KELLY
                  Four-thirty-seven.

     They pass a couple of teenagers playing basketball in a driveway,
     a guy mowing his yard.

                                  NICOLE
                  Nice.

                                  KELLY
                  What do you want, he's a teacher for
                  Christ's sake.
                         (beat)
                  It's here.  Pull over.

     Nicole does, before one of the not-so-neat houses.  Sam's muddy
     Jeep Wrangler is parked in the drive.  Behind that is a red
     Mercedes convertible.

     INT. SAM'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - SAME

     Sam and BARBARA, 28, a lean, beautiful country-clubber roll on
     the bed.  Barbara is dressed for tennis.  Sam wears a baggy pair
     of khaki shorts.  Barbara struggles to escape.  Sam grabs a leg,
     kisses the back of her knee.

     He pushes up the little white skirt, kissing her between her
     thighs.

                                  BARBARA
                         (getting just a little
                          breathless)
                  Sam, come on... I'm gonna be late for my
                  game...

     Sam keeps at it.  She's starting to weaken.

                                  BARBARA (CONT'D)
                  Not that I'm going to be much good after
                  last night...

                                  SAM
                  Eat a power bar.

     Barbara starts to giggle.  He's just about got her when...

     The DOORBELL RINGS.  Sam lets go.  Barbara sighs.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

     Sam goes to the front door, opens it, to find...

     Kelly and Nicole, holding plastic pails full of rags.  The girls
     are dressed in Blue Bay High T-shirts, cropped to REVEAL flat
     tummies, shorts and running shoes.

                                  GIRLS
                  Hi, Mr. Lombardo.

     Sam looks over the girls -- a small, exasperated smile.

                                  KELLY
                  Look, he forgot.  I knew it.

                                  SAM
                  No I didn't.  Check out the Jeep.  It's
                  nice and dirty for you.
                         (beat)
                  But you might want to wait a minute.
                  The Mercedes is leaving.

                                  NICOLE
                  You mean that isn't yours too?

     The girls giggle.  Sam smiles.

                                  KELLY
                  Where's the hose?  We can set up.

                                  SAM
                  In back of the garage.

     As they walk away, he is joined by Barbara.  She watches the
     girls with an appraising eye.

                                  BARBARA
                  Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid?

                                  SAM
                  Kelly.

                                  BARBARA
                  She's going to wash your Jeep?

                                  SAM
                  Senior class fund-raising gig.  I told
                  'em they could hose down the Jeep.
                         (off Barbara's look)
                  Hey, come on.  It's for a good cause.

     Barbara laughs at him.

                                  BARBARA
                  Sam the philanthropist.
                         (a beat)
                  Tomorrow, right?

     Sam nods.  Another kiss.

     EXT. SAM'S DRIVEWAY - SAME

     As Barbara goes to her car she sees the girls coming from behind
     the garage.  She looks at Sam, standing in his doorway, watching
     the girls.  When he sees Barbara looking at him, he shrugs, then
     waves.

     EXT. FRONT DOOR - SAM'S HOUSE - LATER

     Kelly and Nicole, looking very much like the finalists in a wet
     T-shirt derby, ring the bell.

     Sam answers.  He looks them over.  A couple of houses down he can
     see the guy with the mower, dumping grass into a can, watching
     the girls, then turning to walk back to his house.

                                  SAM
                  So, where you off to now?

                                  KELLY
                  Aren't  you forgetting something?
                          (off Sam's look)
                  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.

                                  SAM
                  Jeez, that thing... Can't you...

                                  KELLY
                         (smiling)
                  Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.

     Nicole laughs.

                                  SAM
                  All right.  I'll have to look for it.

                                  KELLY
                         (as he starts to go)
                  Mr. Lombardo.
                         (as he stops)
                  We're running kind of late.  How about
                  if Nicole goes on to the Mansons?  You
                  could give me a ride when you find the
                  ticket.

     Sam looks at her, as does Nicole.

                                  SAM
                  Give me a minute.

     He hurries from the room.  Kelly turns to Nicole, giving her the
     eye, pointing toward the drive.

                                  NICOLE
                         (mouthing the words)
                  Are you sure?

     Kelly nods, a mischievous smile on her face.

     INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - SAME

     Sam is rummaging through drawers.  He stops when he hears the
     SOUND of a CAR.  He goes to the window in time to see Nicole's
     BMW headed down his street.

     INT. SAM'S LIVING ROOM - SAME

     Sam ENTERS the room to find Kelly just inside the doorway, where
     the water from her wet clothing has formed little pools on the
     linoleum.

     Sam looks at the water.  He looks at Kelly.  She moves a step
     closer, allowing the door to SWING shut behind her.

     EXT. SAM'S NEIGHBORHOOD

     A long, slow, Antonioni PAN -- time passes -- the cul-de-sac --
     the sparkling lawns -- the kids with the basketball -- a jogger
     passing by...

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. SAM'S PORCH - LATER

     The front door.  The door opens.  Kelly comes out, fast, slamming
     the door behind her.  She walks down the drive.

     There are tears on her face.  As she hits the street, she begins
     to run.

     The man with the mower is now seated on his parch, drinking beer.
     He watches as the girl runs by.

     The teenagers are still playing hoops.  They stop as Kelly jogs
     past, sobbing.  They watch as she hits the end of the cul-de-sac
     and DISAPPEARS around a corner.

     EXT. THE EVERGLADES - DAY

     Sam, perched in the pilot's seat of a beat-to-shit old air boat,
     rips through the Florida swamp land.

     He glides across channels of water, then turns into the tall
     grass which whips at the hull of his boat.  Bits and pieces of
     debris fly through the air.  Sam smiles, swinging the boat
     through a series of wide, sliding turns.

     Suddenly he spots something.  He throttles down gliding into a
     shallow pool where... A HUGE ALLIGATOR, aware it has been found
     out, whips about, stirring up mud, then scuttling OUT OF SIGHT

                                  SAM
                  Sly old fucker.  How you got so big,
                  wasn't it?

     Sam sits for a moment in the silence.  He pulls a pair of
     binoculars from beneath his seat and looks through them.

     ANGLE ON HORIZON

     All we SEE is a shabby collection of whitewashed buildings
     shimmering in the last long light of afternoon.

     Sam watches for some time.  At last he lowers the binoculars,
     revs up his engine and leaves.

     ANGLE ON SAM'S BOAT

     as it moves away, as SEEN from water level where...

     The old gator has risen once more -- just the eyes -- a cold
     primordial intelligence, gazing out, unblinking across the murky
     waters of the swamp.

     EXT. SAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Sam's Wrangler pulls in next to Barbara's Mercedes.  The Jeep is
     muddy once more.  So is Sam.  He gets out.

     INT. SAM'S HOUSE - SAME

     Sam ENTERS.  The house is dark.

                                   SAM
                  Barbara?

     Nothing.  Me CROSSES the living room and starts down the hallway,
     where a faint light issues from beneath the bedroom door.

     INT. BEDROOM - SAME

     Sam opens the door.  He hears the SOUND of RUNNING WATER.  He
     walks across the room and into the bathroom.

     INT. BATHROOM - SAME

     Clouded mirrors, a shower stall full of. steam.  Behind the glass
     door we SEE an indistinct shape, moving about in the hot water.
     Sam opens the shower door.  The steam clears to REVEAL Barbara's
     gorgeous athletic body.

                                  BARBARA
                  It's hot in here, just the way you like
                  it.

     She grabs his shirt, pulling him into the shower's flow.  They
     kiss.  She pulls his shirt open, loosens his pants.  His clothes
     fall away.  Sam pushes her up against the tile wall, hard.  She
     holds to his shoulders, nails sinking into his flesh, wrapping
     her legs around his hips as...

     The water, dark with swamp mud, spirals down the drain.

     EXT. VAN RYAN ESTATE - NIGHT

     Kelly Van Ryan sits on the dock, looking back toward the huge
     stone house, where...

     A YELLOW LIGHT burns in one of the upstairs windows.

     Kelly has a shotgun laid across her knees.  Slowly, she raises
     the gun, pointing at the yellow window.

     She holds it there for some time, then, softly, to herself...

                                  KELLY
                  Bang...

     INT. MASTER BEDROOM - VAN RYAN ESTATE - NEXT DAY

     Sunlight streams through open windows, mingling with loud sighs
     of pleasure... Sandra Van Ryan on top of FRANKIE CONDO, a big,
     buffed-out Cuban.  They're making love on the bed.  She throws
     her head back -- an explosion of hair -- gasps -- an orgasm is
     near, as...

     A cordless PHONE RINGS on the night table.  They try to ignore
     it.  No dice.  Sandra groans, finally pulling away.

                                  SANDRA
                  Goddamnit!
                         (she answers)
                  Hello.

                                  COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)
                  Hello, this is the attendance office at
                  Blue Bay School.  Your son or daughter
                  is absent today, Monday...

                                  SANDRA
                  Jesus H. Christ!

     She hangs up hard.  Sits on the edge of the bed.

                                  FRANKIE
                  What?

     Sandra waves him off.  She pulls on a T-shirt, then grabs up the
     phone once more, punching in a number.

     INT. SAM'S OFFICE - BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY

     Desk, files, a terrarium full of swamp lizards, above which a
     photo of the Windward Passage decorates the wall.  There's a
     Waterford bowl on the desk -- etched with "Sam Lombardo -- Blue
     Bay Educator of the Year."

     Sam is working on the computer.  The PHONE RINGS.  He answers.

                                  SAM
                  Counseling.

     XNTERCUT - SANDRA/SAM PHONE CONVERSATION

     Sandra seated on the bed, one long leg tucked beneath her.

                                  SANDRA
                  Sam, Sandy Van Ryan.

     Frankie's eyes go cold when he hears the word "Sam."

     In his office, Sam pushes himself away from the computer,
     stiffening noticeably.

                                  SAM
                  Sandy... What's up?

                                  SANDRA
                  Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you
                  talked to her?

                                  SAM
                  No.

                                  SANDRA
                  Shit. Here we go again.

                                  SAM
                  Didn't you see her this morning?

                                  SANDRA
                  To tell you the truth, I haven't seen
                  her since Friday.

     BOOM -- A SHOTGUN BLASTS outside Sandra's window.  She jumps.
     BOOM, BOOM -- more BLASTS.  She jumps up to look outside.

     SANDRA'S POV - KELLY

     stands at the edge of the bay, launching skeet then blasting them
     high above the water.

     BACK TO SCENE

                                  SANDRA (CONT'D)
                  Never mind.  I found her.
                         (a long beat)
                  Listen, Sam.  It was good seeing you the
                  other day.
                         (beat)
                  I haven't found anyone else can handle
                  the Jonathan like you can.

     She glances at Frankie -- who has heard enough.  He gives her a
     long hard look, then rolls from the bed to walk from the room.

     Sam remains silent, watching the lizards with their blank,
     unblinking eyes.

                                  SANDRA (CONT'D)
                  Look.  I know you're seeing Barbara
                  Baxter.  So what?

                                  SAM
                  So maybe I'm a one-woman man.

     Sandra laughs.

                                  SANDRA
                  Right.
                         (beat)
                  You really think you're gonna get one of
                  these Blue Bay women to marry you?

     Sandra pauses to laugh once more.

                                  SANDRA (CONT'D)
                  Grab a clue, Sam.  You're a hired hand
                  around here.  Enjoy it while it lasts.

                                  SAM
                  Goodbye, Sandra.

     Sam puts down the phone, looks at it -- a long moment as -- the
     barest hint of a smile plays upon his face.

     Sandra slams down her phone.  She looks to the bay, to the sleek
     racing sloop floating beyond the private dock.

                                  SANDRA
                  The nerve of some people.

     EXT. VAN RYAN ESTATE - DAY

     The SHOTGUN BLASTS away.  Kelly pauses to reload.  She catches
     sight of...

     Sandra, approaching from the main house.

                                  SANDRA
                  You seem to find guns therapeutic.
                  Maybe I oughta try it.

     Kelly lets the gun's barrel drift over Sandra, then turns to walk
     away.  She moves toward the guest house.  A used-brick cottage
     tucked among the gnarled branches and roots of a huge banyan
     tree.  Sandra follows.

                                  SANDRA (CONT'D)
                  Let me guess, some boy didn't call and
                  screwed up the weekend.  So you're
                  taking the day off.

     Kelly looks toward the main house, in time to see...

     Frankie walk from the bedroom and dive into the pool.

                                  KELLY
                  Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?

                                  SANDRA
                  Whichever one I want.

     Kelly turns away, starts for the guest house once more.

     INT. GUEST HOUSE - DAY

     PAN to REVEAL room -- the gun case, the animal trophies, the
     photos -- One of a stately old gentleman in an elaborate wicker
     chair, a cane at his side, a bowler on his knee.  Others of Kelly
     and a handsome middle-aged man in safari gear, posing with their
     rifles above slain wildebeests and bison.

     Sandra and Kelly ENTER.  Kelly puts down the shotgun, turns,
     tears in her eyes.

                                  SANDRA
                  Okay, what's the matter?

                                  KELLY
                  You notice my new jumper?

     Kelly does a three-sixty, like a model on a runway.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  My friends buy me clothes, so I don't
                  look like trash.

                                  SANDRA
                  I would hardly say you look like trash.

                                  KELLY
                  No thanks to you.

     She sits on the bed.  Sandra moves to stand over her, angry now.

                                  SANDRA
                  Come off of it.
                         (a beat)
                  You run with all these little trust fund
                  brats... They think money grows on
                  trees.  It doesn't.  Believe me.  And a
                  lot of your little friends are gonna
                  learn that one the hard way.
                         (beat)
                  I'm trying to spare you that.

     Kelly goes to one shoulder on the bed, sobbing now.  Her mother
     continues to stand over her, suddenly more perplexed than angry.

                                  SANDRA (CONT'D)
                  Kelly.  What is it?

                                  KELLY
                  I miss Dad.

                                  SANDRA
                  Jesus.
                         (a long beat)
                  Well, I do too, sometimes...

                                  KELLY
                  No you don't.

                                  SANDRA
                  He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly.
                  He could have gone out and gotten a job.
                  Christ, he could've found another rich
                  woman... He never had a problem tucking
                  my friends when we were married.

     She pauses as Kelly cries all the harder.

                                  SANDRA (CONT'D)
                  I don't know why he did it.  I really
                  don't...

     Her voice trails away, as meanwhile Kelly has drawn herself up
     into a fetal position on the bed.  The sobbing has stopped but
     her shoulders continue to shake.  Sandra sits on the edge of the
     bed, reaches over to rub Kelly's back.

                                  SANDRA (CONT'D)
                  Can I get you anything?

     Kelly shakes her head, no.

     Her mother looks at her, clearly at a loss.  At last she stands.
     She is headed out of the room when Kelly says something, but the
     words are indistinct, as her fists are pressed against her mouth.

                                  SANDRA
                  What, honey?  I can't hear you.

     There is a long beat as Kelly collects herself.  She stares at
     the wall, her eyes filled with tears, but when she speaks she
     enunciates each word.

                                  KELLY
                  I said.  I was raped.

     Sandra looks as if she has been struck.

                                  SANDRA
                  What?

                                  KELLY
                  I was raped.
                         (a long beat)
                  By Sam Lombardo.

     Sandra moves over to the bed, sits once more.

                                  SANDRA
                  He... Sam Lombardo?

                                  KELLY
                  Yes.  God, Mom...

     Kelly begins to cry.  Sandra pulls her upright, cradling her in
     her arms, eyes on fire.

     EXT. BLUE BAY POLICE STATION - DAY

     An old Spanish-style building sits before a neat square of grass.

                                  SANDRA (V.O.)
                  My daughter does not get raped in Blue
                  Bay!

     INT. STATION HOUSE - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

     Sandra slams a fist on the conference table.

     Kelly is seated between her mother and her mother's attorney, TOM
     BAXTER.  Baxter sports an Italian suit and a lethal Alexander
     Haig look.

     Seated across from these three are Ray, Gloria and BRYCE HUNTER,
     the local D.A.

     Silence follows Sandra's outburst.  Baxter reaches to squeeze
     Sandra's shoulder.  Kelly puts her face in her hands.

                                  RAY
                         (in a quiet voice)
                  You're saying that Kelly was raped by
                  Sam Lombardo.

                                  SANDRA
                  That's right.

     Ray and Gloria exchange looks.  Gloria in particular looks
     slightly stunned.

                                  GLORIA
                  The guidance counselor at Blue Bay?

                                  SANDRA
                         (sarcastically)
                  The guidance counselor at Blue Bay.

                                  GLORIA
                  We understand your feelings, Ms. Van
                  Ryan.  But please, we'd like some time
                  with Kelly.  We'd like to take her
                  statement alone.

     Baxter nods, yes.  Sandra looks at Kelly.

                                  SANDRA
                  Are you okay for this?

     Kelly nods.

                                  SANDRA (CONT'D)
                  The man must be insane to think he can
                  do this to me...

     Tom Baxter takes her by the arm as Ray CROSSES the room to open
     the door.  Bryce Hunter walks out with then.

     Gloria takes a seat closer to Kelly.  When she speaks, she is
     very calm and quiet.

                                  GLORIA
                  How are you, Kelly? Would you like to
                  take a break for a minute?

                                  KELLY
                         (shaking her head)
                  I just want to get it over with.  My
                  mom's making me do this. I just want to
                  forget it.

                                  GLORIA
                  I know you do.

     She waits as Ray sets up a camera on a tripod.

                                  GLORIA (CCNT'D)
                  We'd like to videotape the statement if
                  that's all right with you.

     Kelly shrugs.

                                  GLORIA (CONT'D)
                  I know this is not pleasant, Kelly.  But
                  these are serious charges and we need to
                  know everything that happened between
                  you and Mr. Lombardo.
                         (beat)
                  Are you ready?

     Kelly nods.

     CLOSE ON VIDEO MONITOR - KELLY'S STATEMENT

                                  KELLY
                  He started rubbing my shoulders.  Said
                  must be sore after washing cars.  I...
                  let him  I mean he's a nice guy.
                         (beat)
                  I don't know... It was so fast.  I
                  closed my eyes.  I remember his hands
                  moved to my breasts.  I mean just for a
                  second it was nice... I forgot whore I
                  was.  I mean he's so gorgeous...

     PULL BACK to REVEAL...

     INT. STATION HOUSE - DAY

     Ray, Gloria and Bryce Hunter stand at one end of the long
     conference table, watching the playback of Kelly's tape.

     BACK TO VIDEOTAPE

                                  KELLY
                  The next thing... his hand was in my
                  shorts... you know, from behind.  His
                  fingers... his fingers...

                                  GLORIA (O.S.)
                  Take your time.

                                  KELLY
                  They were in me.  Both places... you
                  know.

                                  GLORIA (O.S.)
                  I understand.

                                  KELLY
                  He said something like, "Do you want it
                  dirty7" or something.
                         (beat)
                  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me
                  to the floor.

                                  GLORIA (O.S.)
                  Was there penetration?  Did he put
                  himself inside you?

                                  KELLY
                  Yes.  I said stop.  I screamed.  I mean
                  that's how it sounded in my head.  He
                  hurt me...

                                  GLORIA (O.S.)
                         (as Kelly breaks into
                          tears)
                  That's okay, Kelly.  You're doing fine.
                         (beat)
                  But I have to ask you something here.
                  When you say it hurt.  Was this the
                  first time a man was inside you?

                                  KELLY
                  No.  I've done it a couple of times, I
                  mean with guys I dated.  But this
                  hurt... like, he was built... you
                  know...

                                  GLORIA (O.S.)
                  He was large?


     Kelly nods, starts to break down again, then holds it off.

                                  GLORIA (O.S., CONT'D)
                  Did you try to fight him?

                                  KELLY
                  I... he had my wrists pinned behind me.
                  I remember my hands were cold.'

                                  GLORIA (O.S.)
                  Then what?

                                  KELLY
                  He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it
                  happen."  Then he just stopped.

                                  GLORIA (O.S.)
                  You mean he withdrew...

                                  KELLY
                  Not at first.  He was still inside but
                  he wasn't moving or anything...  He said
                  we had this secret.  And that now he'd
                  be able to help me... because we were
                  close... Something like that.  I don't
                  know.  It's hard to remember, exactly.

                                  GLORIA (O.S.)
                  Try, Kelly.

                                  KELLY
                  I know one thing he said.  It was
                  when... when he took himself out and was
                  standing up.
                         (beat)
                  He said, "Don't worry, I didn't come."
                  I can't forget that.  He said, "No
                  little girl can ever make me come."

     The tape is paused -- FREEZES on Kelly's face ON SCREEN.

     BACK TO RAY, GLORIA & HUNTER

                                  HUNTER
                  "No little girl can ever make me come."
                  Jesus.  Too bad.  We might have some
                  physical evidence.

     Ray and Gloria stare at the screen.

                                  GLORIA
                  I don't know.  It feels wrong.

     Ray and Hunter look at her.

                                  HUNTER
                  Why?

                                  GLORIA
                  I think she's acting.  I think she set
                  it up to be alone with him because she
                  wanted him to come on to her.
                         (beat)
                  I think maybe she's upset that he
                  didn't...

                                  RAY
                  Or maybe she thought that was what she
                  wanted and she got a little more than
                  she bargained for...

                                  HUNTER
                  The line I get on this guy, is that he's
                  done half the women in Blue Bay.

                                  GLORIA
                  That doesn't make him a child rapist.
                         (beat)
                  There's something else.  This girl's had
                  some problems.  Wrecked a couple of her
                  mom's cars.  Ran away...

                                  HUNTER
                  Where's this coming from?

                                  GLORIA
                  I worked Juvenile in Dade County for
                  three years.  We had a missing persons
                  on Kelly Van Ryan for two weeks... Maybe
                  a year ago... The family kept it out of
                  the papers.

                                  RAY
                  That would make it about the time of her
                  old man's suicide.  You don't think that
                  could explain some erratic behavior?

                                  GLORIA
                  All I'm saying is, I think we should go
                  slow here.

     Hunter puts his hands together, thinking.  He looks from Ray to
     Gloria, than back to Ray.

                                  HUNTER
                  I want a full-scale investigation.

                                  GLORIA
                  You know what that will mean for
                  Lombardo.

                                  HUNTER
                  I don't care.  You heard that girl's
                  statement.  I think he's dirty.  Get me
                  a case.

     Gloria and Ray watch as Hunter gets up and leaves the room.

                                  GLORIA
                  Well you were a big help.  You know
                  what's going to happen if we go
                  full-bore on this.

     Ray looks at the screen.

                                  RAY
                  It's our job, Gloria.

                                  GLORIA
                  Hunter's making it our job because
                  Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass.
                  You know that as well as I do.
                         (beat)
                  We're gonna trash this guy's life and I
                  keep asking myself if it's really
                  necessary.

     Ray thinks this over.  He continues to study the screen.

                  him.  Maybe he's got it coming.

     BEGIN MONTAGE - INVESTIGATION

     EXT. CUL-DE-SAC - DAY

     Ray takes notes, talks with neighbors, kids, lawn mower man.

     EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DRIVEWAY - DAY

     Gloria talks with students -- Jimmy, Nicole, others.

     INT. SAM'S OFFICE - DAY

     Sam sits at his desk, toying with a pencil.  He watches students
     pass -- no smiles, no waves, an occasional dark look.

     Through the press of students Sam sees Art at the door of his
     office.  The two men look at one another.  At which point...

     Gloria, followed by Ray, steps INTO SCENE.  The detectives shake
     hands with Art.  As Art turns to close the door, Sam falls within
     his line of vision.  Art looks away.  The door swings shut.

     EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL DOCKS - LATER

     The sky has begun to color.  Art Maddox stands on the grass at
     the end of the channel separating the slips, watching as...

     A lone sailboat tacks toward the school.

     ANGLE ON BOAT - SAM & JIMMY

     Sam drops his sail, leaving himself just enough momentum to
     cruise expertly into the little channel then into the slip.

     Art watches as Jimmy jumps from the boat, ties it off.

                                  SAM
                  That's good, Jimbo.  I'll see you on
                  Monday.

     Jimmy hesitates, he wants to say something.  Sam waves him off.
     Jimmy gives Art a hard look and heads for the grass.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                         (to Art, nodding after
                          Jimmy)
                  What's left of my sailing class.

     Art studies the dock between his feet.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  Talk to me Artie.

                                  ART
                  Kelly Van Ryan...

                                  SAM
                  ... is accusing me of rape.  Jimmy told
                  me.  Apparently I'm the last to know...

                                  ART
                  Sam... I...
                         (a long beat)
                  Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with
                  every member of the school board all day
                  long.  She's pushing for suspension...

                                  SAM
                  This is insane.

     Art shakes his head.

                                  ART
                  All I can tell you Sam, is hang in
                  there.  They clear you of this mess, you
                  get reinstated, with back pay...

                                  SAM
                  That's great.  I'll just tell my
                  creditors I'm not a rapist.  No
                  problem... Shit.
                         (beat)
                  I can't believe the board's going to act
                  without even hearing my side of it.

                                  ART
                  The Van Ryan family created Blue Bay.
                  They built the school... Sandra Van Ryan
                  calls up the board and says kiss my ass,
                  they say, left, right, or in the middle.
                         (beat)
                  You're gonna need some help on this one,
                  Sam.  You're gonna need a lawyer, and
                  he'd better be a good one.

     EXT. STRIP MALL - DAY

     Typical of its kind -- a Blockbuster Video, a 7-Eleven, half a
     dozen small businesses, one of which, sandwiched between a donut
     shop and the Mongolian Beef Bowl, bears the sign:  "KEN BOWDEN --
     ATTORNEY AT LAW."

     INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

     Sam sits in a cramped waiting room, leafing through a magazine.

     An attractive young SECRETARY sits a few feet away, behind her
     desk.  Her PHONE RINGS.  She picks it up, then turns to Sam,
     favoring him with a flirtatious smile.

                                  SECRETARY
                  Mr. Bowden will see you now.

     INT. OFFICE - DAY

     Ken Bowden, a slightly oily-looking young man in a nice suit and
     a large, padded neck brace, rises to shake Sam's hand.

                                  KEN
                  Sam, hey, it's been a while.
                         (beat)
                  Looked for you at the ten year reunion.
                  You missed out.  Three days at the
                  Disneyworld Hotel... Partied ourselves
                  silly.

     Sam nods.

                                  KEN (CONT'D)
                  Couple of your old flames were there.
                  You remember Jill, with the knockers.

     Ken holds his hands out in front of his chest.

                                  KEN (CONT'D)
                  Blew up like the Goodyear blimp.

     Sam forces a smile.

                                  KEN (CONT'D)
                  But check this...

                                  SAM
                         (interrupting)
                  Ken.  I'm in some trouble.  I need an
                  attorney and you're the only one I know.
                  So I figured I'd start here.

     Ken stops, puts on a serious face.

                                  KEN
                  Well, I'm glad you did.  And I'm sorry.
                         (folding his hands before
                          him)
                  Why don't you tell me about it.

     Sam looks at him.  He starts to speak, then checks himself.

                                  SAM
                  What did you do to your neck?

     Ken puts a hand to his throat, as if aware of the brace for the
     first time.

                                  KEN
                  Oh this... chiropractor did a number on
                  me.

     He takes the brace off, tossing it on his desk.

                                  KEN (CONT'D)
                  I don't really have to wear the thing
                  all the time.
                         (beat)
                 A guy from the insurance was here.

     Ken smiles.  Sam looks slightly ill.

                                  KEN (CONT'D)
                  Go ahead, Sam.  Shoot.  Let's see what
                  we've got here.

     EXT. A BLUE HAY RESTAURANT - NIGHT

     Trendy nouveau.  A valet parks Sam's Jeep.

     INT. RESTAURLNT - SAME

     Sam walks across a tiled entry.  He looks tired, but smiles at
     the maitre d'.

                                  SAM
                  Georgie, hey.  I'm meeting Barbara.  She
                  here yet?

     GEORGE looks stiff, maybe a little nervous.  Sam picks up on it.
     He scans the room...

     ANGLE ON ROOM

     Dimly-lit, crowded, but we PICK OUT Barbara, stunning in a
     delicate white sun dress, tanned arms resting upon a table.

     Sam starts toward her.  George reaches out to touch his arm.

                                  GEORGE
                  Mr. Lombardo.

     Sam ignores him, threading his way among the people at a lavish
     bar, then stopping short as he sees who Barbara is with -- her
     father, Tom Baxter.

     Tom Baxter sees Sam, gets to his feet.

                                  BAXTER
                  This is not appropriate Lombardo.

     Sam steps to one side, makes eye contact with Barbara.

     Barbara has tears in her eyes.  She looks at Sam, then shakes her
     head, looking away.

                                  SAM
                  Barbara...

                                  BAZTER
                  You're finished in Blue Bay, Lombardo.
                  You've been scratching at the door long
                  enough...
                         (as Sam faces him)
                  I ever see you around my daughter,
                  you're going to be finished, period.

     The two men square off, but already we can SEE Georgie, trailed
     by a pair of beefy characters in blue blazers making their way
     across the room.

     Sam sees them too.  He takes a final look at Barbara.  When she
     refuses to meet his eye, he pushes past Baxter, through the crowd
     and out of the restaurant.

     EXT. AN EVERGLADES ROADHOUSE - NIGHT

     Red neon identifies it as Jim's Recovery Room.  A handful of
     trucks sit in a dirt parking lot, Sam's Jeep among them.

     INT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT

     The air is thick with smoke.  Locals shoot pool.  The walls are
     decorated with dusty fishing nets and inflated blowfish.

     An aging BARMAID -- good-looking -- once, runs a rag around a
     pitcher, looks down the bar, smiles, finding...

     Sam, alone, awaiting service.

                                  BARMAID
                  Sam, honey... Haven't seen you in a
                  while.  How's life treatin' you?
                         (off Sam's look)
                  That bad, huh?  Well, you came to the
                  right place.

     EXT. ROADHOUSE - LATER

     Sam walks outside.  He stands in the red glow of neon light,
     looking toward the road... On the opposite side of which...

     ... sits a sorry little collection of whitewashed stucco
     bungalows, identified by a green neon sign as the Glades Motel.

     Beyond the motel are the Everglades, a great expanse of darkness.

     Sam stares at the motel.  At last he gets in his Jeep.  As he
     EXITS the lot, a second pair of headlights flashes on.

     EXT. EVERGLADES - NIGHT

     A deserted two-lane road cuts through the swamp.  Trees bearded
     with moss appear as ghostly shapes in the lights of Sam's Jeep.

     INT./EXT. SAM'S JEEP - MOVING - SAME

     San drives -- a tired face.  Soft MUSIC on the RADIO.

     Something APPEARS in the road, caught for a moment in the
     headlights.  Sam swerves, whirls his head around, sees...

     A GATOR sliding of the shoulder and into the murky water.

     Sam lets out some air, relaxing a bit, then catches sight of
     something else -- Headlights finding reflection in his rearview
     mirror, coming fast.  Sam watches as the lights get closer.  He
     looks back to the road -- an approaching curve...

     Sam is into the curve when the lights catch him.  A black Range
     Rover moves out to pass, then turns suddenly into Sam's lane,
     cutting him off.

     It happens quickly.  Sam swerves to avoid hitting the larger car,
     but the road affords little margin for error.

     The JEEP slides across a narrow shoulder, then plummets down a
     steep embankment, CRASHING through cattails, rolling over to SLAM
     BACK DOWN on its tires in a swampy gulch.

     Sam slumps back from the steering wheel.  Somewhere over his head
     he can see headlights shining into the trees.

     He hears a CAR DOOR SLAM, the SOUNDS of someone scrambling down
     the embankment.

     Sam tries to get out of his seat harness.  Someone is
     approaching, splashing through the muck.  Suddenly a hand reaches
     through the broken driver's window, helping him.

                                  MAN'S VOICE
                  Are you all right?

     The hands get him loose.  Sam stumbles from the car.

                                  SAM
                  Yeah, I'm okay.

     He looks up to find -- Frankie Condo, looming over him.

                                  FRANKIE
                  That's too bad.

     He grabs Sam, pulling him OUT OF FRAME.  What we are left with is
     the SOUND of FISTS THUDDING INTO FLESH -- then Sam, hitting the
     hood of his Jeep, slumping down into the muck.

     Frankie is breathing hard.  We HEAR him SLOGGING back up the
     embankment.  We HEAR a DOOR SLAM, the RANGE ROVER driving away,
     leaving only darkness, and the EERIE SOUNDS of the swamp.

     EXT. THE STRIP MALL - DAY

     Dazzling light.  Sam's smashed-up Jeep is parked before Ken
     Bowden's office, next door to the Mongolian Beef Bowl.

     INT. BEEF BOWL - SAME

     Sam and Ken eye one another over a green plastic table -- Ken
     with his neck brace, Sam with a bruised face.

                                  KEN
                  I figured, you know, it would be darker
                  in here.

     He moves a hand to his face.

                                  SAM
                  Good thinking.

                                  KEN
                  You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van
                  Ryan...

                                  SAM
                  Forget it.

                                  KEN
                  Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all
                  I'm saying.

                                  SAM
                  I know how deep her pockets are, Ken.  I
                  thought I might be able to save my
                  fucking house with an equity loan.
                  Guess who's on the board of directors at
                  the bank?

     He pauses to look at Ken Bowden.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  Can't you take that stupid thing off?

                                  KEN
                  Not in here.  Chiropractor comes in here
                  for lunch sometimes.

     San sighs, slumps back in his plastic seat.

                                  KEN (CONT'D)
                  You're not in bad shape, really.  I know
                  you think you are, but you're not.  Let
                  me tell you why.
                         (beat)
                  Sandra Van Ryan.

                                  SAM
                  What's that supposed to mean?

                                  KEN
                  For you to be getting this kind of heat,
                  for what they have on you... It doesn't
                  add up.  Sandra Van Ryan's got 'em
                  running scared.
                         (beat)
                  And I'll tell you something else, you
                  rush, you get careless.

     Ken reaches into his briefcase.  He pulls out some papers, tosses
     them on the table.  Sam picks one up, starts to read.

                                  SAM
                  Nellie Gail Ranch...

                                  KEN
                  Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab
                  farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went
                  when her morn fished her out of the
                  swamp.
                         (beat)
                  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year
                  I mean there's no way they can put
                  this thing in front of a jury.
                         (beat)
                  Shit, they haven't even taken your
                  statement yet.  Reason?  They're still
                  shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're
                  coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.

                                  SAM
                  There's nothing for them to get.

                                  KEN
                  Good.  So what we're going to do is
                  march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're
                  going to insist they take a statement.
                  We're going to tell them to charge your
                  ass or get off your back.
                         (beat)
                  They're walking a fine line here.
                  Defamation of character, malicious
                  prosecution...

                                  SAM
                  I just want my life back...

                                  KEN
                  Fair enough.  Let's go make a statement.

     INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

     Everyone's looking a little tired, with the possible exception of
     Ray.  At this moment he sits back in his chair, staring at Sam.

                                  RAY
                  Why don't you tell us one more time, how
                  Kelly came to be with you, alone in your
                  house.

                                  SAM
                         (with growing impatience)
                  Story's the same, Detective...

     Ken pats him on the arm.  When Sam speaks again, it is in a
     calmer voice, calm but tired.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  I had to go look for this coupon.

                                  RAY
                  The one you bought at school.

                                  SAM
                         (nodding)
                  Like I said, I hadn't really expected to
                  use it.
                         (beat)
                  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I
                  hear a car.  I look out the window.  I
                  see Nicole driving away.  I leave my
                  room, and there's Kelly.

                                  RAY
                  In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.

                                  SAM
                  Yes.

                                  RAY
                  And she wanted to talk.

                                  SAM
                  Yes.

                                  RAY
                  But you can't tell us what she wanted to
                  talk about.

                                  SAM
                  I could, but it's confidential.  Look,
                  the point is, we didn't talk.  I told
                  her this was not an appropriate time or
                  place.

                                  RAY
                  And she began to cry.  And you put an
                  arm around her.

                                  SAM
                  Yes.  Mainly to turn her toward the
                  door.  I told her we would talk on
                  Monday, in the office.

                                  GLORIA
                  And when you turned her toward the door,
                  where did you expect her to go, without
                  a car?

                                  SAM
                  Again.  I think we covered this.  I told
                  her I was going to call a cab.

                                  RAY
                  But she ran away.

                                  SAM
                  That's right.

                                  GLORIA
                  Did you call anyone?  Did you call her
                  house to see if she got home?  Did you
                  call the Masons?

                                  SAM
                  No.

                                  GLORIA
                  Weren't you a little worried about
                  her...?

                                  SAM
                  There's a strip mall not half a mile
                  from my house.  There's phones there.  I
                  cruised the place, but I didn't see her.
                  I figured she was probably there but
                  that she was angry and didn't want to be
                  found.  I don't know... Maybe I should
                  have called.  But it's not like Kelly
                  can't take care of herself.  I figured
                  we'd just take it up on Monday, in the
                  office.

     There is a moment of silence in the room.

                                  RAY
                  But you do admit to touching her, to
                  putting your arm around her.  Isn't that
                  against the rules?

                                  SAM
                  It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...
                         (beat)
                  But, I mean... there's this kid standing
                  in front of you crying...

                                  RAY
                  With a thirty-five inch bustline in a
                  wet T-shirt with no bra...

     He is cut short as Sam shoves his chair back from the table.

                                  SAM
                  Fuck you.  This is bullshit.  I'm outta
                  here.

                                  RAY
                  Sit down, Lombardo.

     Sam and Ray stare at one another.  Ken puts a hand on his
     client's arm.

                                  KEN
                  All right, all right... Enough.

     Ken stands up.  He walks to the two-way mirror set in one wall,
     rapping on the glass with his knuckles.

                                  KEN (CONT'D)
                  We came down here to make a statement.
                  We've made it.

                  If you're going to charge my client, do
                  it now.

     INT. OPPOSITE SIDE MIRROR ROOM - HUNTER

     stares at Ken's face, about a foot away.  Ken of course can't see
     him.  Hunter gives him the finger.

     INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - KEN

     stares into the mirror, waiting.

                                  KEN
                  I didn't think so.
                         (to Sam)
                  Let's go.

     Ken opens the door.  Sam turns back to Ray and Gloria.

                                  SAM
                  I've spent the last ten years of my life
                  working with kids.  I love what I do,
                  and I think I'm good at it.
                         (beat)
                  These kids trust me, and there is no
                  way.  No way in hell I would ever betray
                  that trust.

     As Ken and Sam leave, Ray and Gloria are joined by Bryce Hunter.

                                  HUNTER
                  Nice speech.  Either of you buying?

     Ray shrugs.

                                  RAY
                  Not that stuff about her running away,
                  him trying to find her.  That's
                  bullshit.

                                  HUNTER
                  What about witnesses?

                                  RAY
                  We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard,
                  couple of kids playing hoops.

                                  HUNTER
                  And what do they say?

                                  GLORIA
                  Same as him.  They saw her come.  They
                  saw her go.  They saw him follow.

                                  RAY
                  Still doesn't explain why he couldn't
                  catch up with her.  I mean how long does
                  it take to put on a shirt?

     At which point, a COP APPEARS in the doorway.

                                  COP
                  Phone, Bryce.  It's Sandra Van Ryan.

                                  HUNTER
                  Christ Almighty.  That woman's calling
                  me six times a day.

     He starts away, then stops.

                                  HUNTER (CONT'D)
                  I think you're onto something, Ray.
                  Stay with it.

     Hunter bangs out of the room.  Gloria slumps in a chair, tired,
     disgusted.

                                  GLORIA
                  We failed to mention the mower guy's a
                  drunk, that he was after more beer and
                  never really saw Kelly go into the
                  house, so he can't say how long she was
                  in there.  Same with the kids.  They saw
                  her running down the street, but that's
                  it.
                         (beat)
                  With no physical evidence, what do we
                  have?  Her word against his.

                                  RAY
                  You're telling me you believe the guy?

                                  GLORIA
                  All I'm saying is, we let Sandra Van
                  Ryan push us too hard, we're going to
                  wind up looking stupid.

     Ray is paged by his BEEPER.  He pulls it off his belt, looks at
     the number.

                                  RAY
                  I'd better return this.

     Ray leaves.  Gloria pulls a cigarette from her purse and lights
     up, rests her head back in the chair, blowing smoke at the
     ceiling.

     INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - LATER

     Gloria is grinding out the butt as Ray walks back in.  There is
     something in the way he carries himself, some sense of urgency.

                                  RAY
                         (off Gloria's look)
                  Seen any good gator wrestling lately?

     EXT./INT. DETECTIVES' CAR - MOVING - DAY

     Ray and Gloria drive through the Everglades, past marshlands
     punctuated by thick stands of melaluca trees.

                                  GLORIA
                  They say it was old man Van Ryan planted
                  the melalucas to dry up the swamp.

     Ray nods.

                                  GLORIA (CONT'D)
                  You can go up to one of those trees and
                  peel the bark.  You know what you get?
                  More bark.  And more bark.  There's no
                  core.  Tree's not good tar anything but
                  sucking up water.  And now they can't
                  get rid of them.  They've tried poisons.
                  Nothing works.  They don't die.

                                  RAY
                  Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his.  I don't
                  imagine he gives a shit now.

     Gloria just looks at him.  Ray stares into the dusty light of an
     approaching sunset.  At last he slows, turning off the highway
     and onto a narrow dirt road.

     A sign pokes out from the tall grass -- "SMILIN' JACK'S FISH
     CAMP."

     The Taurus bounces along the washboard road.

     They are driving now at the edge of a canal.

                                  RAY
                  You remember that little girl walked out
                  of our talk at Blue Bay?

                  Beats the shit out of me why she would

                  six months at Camp Nine.

                                  GLORIA
                  You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.

     Ray gives her a look.  Gloria shrugs.

                                  GLORIA (CONT'D)
                  That's what they called it when I was in
                  Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place.

                                  RAY
                  It's a shithole.  But she was dirty,
                  what was I gonna do?

     They pass a sagging chain-link fence, entering a quarter-mile run
     of shabby trailers and cheap shacks.

     The squalor of the buildings is seat in contrast to the beauty of
     the Glades where the waters have gone to the color of polished
     brass beneath an immense, darkening sky.

     Ray parks before a ramshackle building covered in vines and
     peeling paint.  A sign reads:  "NIGHT CRAWLERS $1 A BUCKET."  The
     jawbones of numerous gators hang beneath the eaves.

     As they get out of the car, something catches Gloria's eye --
     along the bank of the canal...

     ANGLE ON BANK

     where a tall man (WALTER) with long white hair and tattooed arms
     kneels inside a pen, slapping a huge gator on its snout.  The
     reptile lifts its upper body, hissing, opening its jaws.

     Walter takes a stick from his hip pocket, passing it through the
     gator's mouth.  The jaws snap shut, incredibly fast, with a
     hollow snapping sound.

     Gloria jumps instinctively, then watches, aghast, as Walter slaps
     the creature once more.  This time moving round to the front of
     the gator, sticking halt his arm inside its mouth.

                                  VOICE (0.5.)
                  He's just showin' off for you now.

     Gloria starts, then turns to find a woman (RUBY) has walked up
     beside her.  The woman is in her sixties.  She's dressed in
     polyester.  Her hair is piled on top of her head -- too dark to
     be anything but a dye job.  A cigarette bobs from her lips.

     Before Gloria can respond, Ray steps up behind than.

                                  RAY
                  Evening Ruby.
                         (beat)
                  I see you still got Walter.  I was sort
                  of hoping something had eaten him by
                  now.

                                  RUBY
                         (a long beat)
                  Can I help you with something?

     Ray and the old lady look at each other.

                                  RAY
                  Suzie called.  You know where we can
                  find her?

     Ruby looks toward the store.

                                  RUBY
                  You know the way.

     She watches as the detectives CROSS the road, then calls to them
     as they start up the steps.

                                  RUBY (CONT'D)
                  You won't shoot her will you?  I don't
                  believe she's armed.

     Gloria turns, surprised.  Ray gives the woman a long, cold stare,
     then opens the door for Gloria.

     INT. CAMP STORE - SAME

     It's dark inside.  The main light source is a tiny, beat-up
     black-and-white TV.

     Two elderly women in colored bouffant hairdos sit on a ratty old
     couch watching reruns of "Family Feud."  They look up as Ray and
     Gloria ENTER then EXIT through a door in the back.

     INT. SUZIE'S ROOM - SAME

     Black walls.  Cheap bookshelves, filled to overflowing.  A wire
     strung with dismembered doll parts runs the length of the room.

     Suzie is propped on a ratty futon, an open book on her stomach,
     her thin, white arms crossed behind her head.

                                  SUZIE
                  Jesus.  It took you long enough.  What
                  if somebody was trying to strangle me?
                  Or fuck me in the ass, even?
                         (beat)
                  I mean, you guys are Sex Crimes.

     Ray manages a thin smile.

                                  RAY
                  Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.

                                  SUZIE
                  I did.  At Blue Balls.

                  Seems to me you left early, before we
                  could meet.  But hi, Suzie.

     Gloria puts out a hand.  Suzie looks at it, puts out a hand of
     her own.

     As the women shake, Gloria looks at the book on Suzie's stomach,
     turning her head as if to read the title.

                                  SUZIE
                  It's Celine.  He's okay.  He had a
                  pretty good line on what cheap fucks
                  people are.

                                  RAY
                  So Suzie, you called us, remember?

     Suzie takes a cigarette from a pack at her side, lights up, blows
     smoke at the ceiling.

                                  SUZIE
                  Did they arrest Mr. Lombardo?

     Ray and Gloria exchange looks.

                                  RAY
                  No.

                                  SUZIE
                  Will they?

                                  RAY
                  It doesn't look like it.

                                  SUZIE
                  Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?

     Ray shrugs.

                                  GLORIA
                  That bothers you?

                                  SUZIE
                         (a long beat)
                  Yeah, maybe, a little.

                                  GLORIA
                  Why is that?

     Suzie lets out her breath.  She rests her head against the wall.

                                  GLORIA (CONT'D)
                  You can talk to us, Suzie.  That's why
                  we're here...

     INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

     Suzie, Gloria and Hunter sit at the conference table.  Ray
     operates the video cam.

                                  GLORIA
                  Okay, Suzie.  We want you to tell us
                  about the day Mr. Lombardo gave you and
                  Jimmy a ride.

       Suzie stares at the three cops around her, then at the camera.

                                  SUZIE
                  You didn't tell me you were gonna put me
                  on the fucking news.

                                  GLORIA
                  We need to tape the interview, Suzie.
                  No one will see it but us.
                         (beat)
                  Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo
                  gave you the ride?

     Suzie stares at the camera.  She's lost the cockiness she had on
     her own turf.  She looks small, white and frail in the sterile
     room, surrounded by the detectives.

                                  SUZIE
                  About a year ago.

                                  GLORIA
                  He dropped Jimmy off first?

                                  SUZIE
                  Yeah.

                                  GLORIA
                  And when he arrived at your house, was
                  anyone there?

                                  SUZIE
                  No.

                                  GLORIA
                  So you were alone.

                                  SUZIE
                  Yes.

                                  GLORIA
                  Did he come in with you?

                                  SUZIE
                  I guess.

                                  HUNTER
                  You guess?  Did he or didn't he?

                                  SUZIE
                  Yeah... okay... he did

                                  HUNTER
                  And then what... he touched you?  Did
                  you maybe flirt a little...

                                  SUZIE
                  I wanna go home now.

     Gloria glares at Hunter, shakes her head.

                                  GLORIA
                  Suzie, look, I know you feel bad.  I
                  know it's harder to talk here than in
                  your room, but we need to get it on
                  tape.
                         (beat)
                  Just tell us what you told us before.
                  Tell us the truth.

     Suzie huddles in her skinny arms, studying the detectives.

                                  SUZIE
                  I didn't say a thing to him.  He just
                  put his arm around me.  Told me I was
                  pretty... I could be really pretty, he
                  said.

   Another moment -- she looks at Ray, then at Hunter.

                                  HUNTER
                  What did you do then?

                                  SUZIE
                         (a long beat)
                  Shit, what difference does it make...
                  Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...

                                  HUNTER
                  Suzie!  Did this man rape you?

                                  SUZIE
                  Okay!  He did.  He pushed me to the
                  floor and he did it to me.  Now, can I
                  go home?

     She stands up.

                                  GLORIA
                  At that point were you able to fight him
                  off?

                                  SUZIE
                  No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay?
                  That's all.  Let me go.

     Gloria gets to her feet as well; she tries to put an arm around
     Suzie.  The girl jumps back as if she has been shocked.

                                  SUZIE (CONT'D)
                  Don't touch me.

     Gloria's hands fall to her sides.

     Suzie heads for the door.


     The detectives exchange looks.
         
     At which point, Suzie stops, turns to face the room.

                                  SUZIE (CONT'D)
                  He did say something.

                                  GLORIA
                  What was that?

                                  SUZIE
                  He said, "No little bitch can ever make
                  me come."

     IN THE COURTROOM

     Kelly Van Ryan sits in the witness box, dabbing her eyes with a
     handkerchief while Bryce Hunter stands before her.  The room is
     silent, the spectators riveted on the scene.

                                  HUNTER
                  Do you need more time?

     Kelly shakes her head, no.

                                  HUNTER (CONT'D)
                  I know this is hard, Kelly, but I have
                  just one more question and even though
                  its something we've been over, I want us
                  all to be very clear about it.

                  he intended to have sex with you, what
                  were your exact words?  What did you

                                  KELLY

     Suzie shoots them a nervous glance, drops her cigarette, bends to
     pick it up, burns her fingers, drops it again.  She curses
     beneath her breath, wrapping her fingers about her shoulders.

     Ray and Gloria watch her, exchange glances.  Gloria picks up
     Suzie's cigarette for her, puts it out in an ashtray.

     INT. COURTROOM - LATER

     PANNING the spectators, we SEE Sandra, Baxter, Ray, Gloria.

     Hunter is on the witness stand.

     Suzie is in the box.  She looks pale, even more nervous.

                                  SUZIE
                  He pushed into me... I couldn't stop
                  him... it hurt.

                                  HUNTER
                  I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?

                                  SUZIE
                  Because... it was the biggest I've ever
                  seen.  And I've seen a lot on their way
                  through Jack's Fish Camp.

     Chuckling in the courtroom.  The JUDGE glares, silencing it.

                                  HUNTER
                  Ms. Toller, did Samuel Lombardo rape you
                  in your family's home on the 23rd of
                  April last year?

     Suzie glances at Sam, hesitates.

                                  HUNTER (CONT'D)
                  Ms. Toller?

                                  SUZIE
                  I said he did.

                                  HUNTER
                  Ms. Toller.  I'm asking you now, under
                  oath, did Samuel Lonbardo rape you?

     Suzie looks around, as if for help.  The spectators stir.
     Ray rubs his eyes.  Gloria's are closed.

                                  SUZIE
                  This wasn't my idea.

                                  HUNTER
                  I'm sorry?

     Suzie looks at Sam once more.

                                  SUZIE
                  Look.  I just don't want to get into any
                  more trouble...

     Tom Baxter rises to his feet.  The Judge raises a hand, motioning
     him to sit back down.

                                 JUDGE
                         (to Baxter)
                  The Court would like to hear what Miss
                  Toller has to say.
                         (to Suzie)
                  Miss Toller.

                                 SUZIE
                  Mr. Lombardo didn't rape me.  He didn't
                  rape Kelly either.  He didn't do
                  anything.

     QUICK CUTS

     Hunter slumps back against the prosecution table.

     Sandra's hand covers her mouth.  Baxter mumbles a curse.

     Sam hangs his head in relief.  Ken grins above his neck brace.

     COURTROOM LOBBY

     The press corps scrambles for cameras.

     BLUE BAY HIGS

     Teachers, students, Art, Jimmy -- crammed around the TV.

                                  JIMMY
                  I don't believe it...

     IN THE COURTROOM

     Bryce Hunter and Tom Baxter are both on their feet, trying to
     make themselves heard above the din.

                                  HUNTER
                  Your Honor... I must object...

                                  JUDGE
                         (hammering for order)
                  I think I made it plain that the Court
                  intends to near Miss Toller's story.

     The Judge turns a cold eye on Suzie.

                                  SUZIE
                  I'm sorry.

                                  JUDGE
                  Sorry?  Just how far did you intend to
                  let this go?

                                  SUZIE
                  I don't know.  I just wanted to hurt Mr.
                  Lombardo.

     Sam looks up, confused.

                                  SUZIE (CONT'D)
                  He was my friend at first.  Then I got
                  busted... he didn't even stick up for
                  me.  I had to go away to that hellhole.
                  It's like, you're his favorite, then who
                  cares?  You wanna know something?  When
                  Kelly said we should do this, I thought
                  cool, all these big shots screwing me
                  over, like that cop, Duquette.  Now
                  they're gonna get screwed.

                                  HUNTER
                  Your Honor... Please...

                                  JUDGE
                  Any more interruptions Mr. Hunter, and
                  the Court will hold you in contempt.
                         (to Suzie)
                  What you are telling me, Ms. Toller, is
                  that Kelly Van Ryan is responsible for
                  conceiving this entire charade...

                                  SUZIE
                  Kelly's pissed at Mr. Lombardo, too.
                  She's in love with him.  I mean her
                  whole fantasy is him since her old man
                  died.  Then she found out that Mr.
                  Lombardo was doing her mom.  I mean that
                  was it...

     Gasps in the court as --

     Kelly BURSTS from the witness waiting room, trailed by a bailiff.

                                  KELLY
                  You stupid little bitch...

     She grabs the first thing she can get her hands on -- a glass of
     water from one of the tables and hurls it toward the witness
     stand before the bailiff can pin her arms against her sides.

     INT. COURTHOUSE LOBBY - LATER

     A mob scene.  Video crews are herded to one side by bailiffs as
     Sandra and Baxter, with Kelly in tow, move toward a side door.

     Sam and Ken round a corner, followed by Ray and Gloria who walk
     on either side of Suzie.

     Kelly sees them.  She makes a run at Suzie.  For a moment the
     girls shove and kick but Ray and Gloria are between them in a
     hurry, pulling then apart as Baxter arrives to take charge of
     Kelly, pulling her toward the door.

     Ruby and Walter arrive now too.  Suzie runs to them and they lead
     her through the crowd, Walter pushing people aside with his long,
     tattooed arms.

     Gloria heaves a sigh.  Ray pushes a hand through his hair, then
     turns to find Sam looking at him.  Most of the press have run off
     to follow the girls -- looking for more action.  It is a quiet
     moment.  The two men lock eyes.

                                  SAM
                  I've found that adolescents make the
                  best liars.  They're old enough to be
                  good at it, but you want like hell to
                  believe them, because they're still
                  children.

     Ray just looks at him -- a hard stare.

     EXT./INT. KEN'S T-BIRD - DAY

     top down, speeds on a highway, banana palms on one side, the blue
     Atlantic on the other.

     Wind buffets Ken and Sam -- who has a dazed look.

                                  KEN
                         (hyped)
                  Come on, let loose!

                                  SAM
                  I was just thinking about where I'm
                  gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's
                  like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.

                                  KEN
                  You'll get over it. We've got a
                  knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a
                  lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.

                                  SAM
                  Just like that?

                                  KEN
                  Just like that?  These people ruined
                  your life, bro.

     Ken pauses to thump the wheel with the butt of his hand.

                                  KEN (CONT'D)
                  I told you they were going overboard and
                  they did... They'll settle.  Believe me.
                  They'll be begging to settle...

     At which point Ken spots something up ahead.  His smile broadens.
     He swerves into the other lane, tooting his horn, waving, as...

     The T-bird draws even with a sleek black limo.

                                  SAM
                  You don't think you're overdoing it?

     He pulls off his neck brace, dangles it in front of Sam's face,
     then tosses it out the window.

     INT. LIMO - MOVING - SAME

     Tom Baxter watches as the T-bird rockets off into the distance, a
     white piece of foam rubber bouncing across the road in its wake.

     A console TV is on -- news of the courthouse chaos.

     Sandra is next to Baxter.  Kelly is on the opposite bench seat.

                                  SANDRA
                  I hope you're going to nail his scrotum
                  to the nearest wall.

                                  BAXTER
                  That might have been a possibility, if
                  little miss not-so-bright here hadn't
                  started throwing things.

                                  KELLY
                  Fuck off.

   Sandra lunges to slap Kelly.  Baxter stops it in midair.

                                  BAXTER
                  See what I mean...

                                  SANDRA
                  You're going to let them get away with
                  this... this shit?  On the word of one
                  little white trash bitch...

                                  BAXTER
                  You like seeing your name in the papers?

     Sandra glares at him.

                                  BAXTER (CONT'D)
                  Leave town, Sandy.  Go to your place in
                  St. Barts.  Let things cool down.

     Sandra concentrates on the TV.

                                  BAXTER (CONT'D)
                  They'll try for twenty million.  The
                  cheaper the lawyer, the higher the
                  demand.

                                  SANDRA
                  You've got to be kidding.

                                  HAXTER
                  The man's life has been destroyed.
                  There will always be doubters, no matter
                  what happened in court.

                                  SANDRA
                  I'm not paying any idiot twenty million
                  dollars.

                                  BAXTER
                  I said that's what they'd ask for.

     Sandra stares from the window.  At last she turns to Kelly.
         
                                  SANDRA
                  I hope you're happy.

     Kelly seems to give this a moment's thought, then, smiling.

                                  KELLY
                  Ecstatic.

     EXT. EVERGLADES - DAY

     Sam cruises slowly across the water in his junked-out air boat.
     He kills the engine, allowing the craft to glide to a stop.

     He's close to where he found the big gator -- the same shabby
     collection of whitewashed buildings we now RECOGNIZE as the
     Glades Motel, shimmers in the distance.

     Sam leans back, enjoying the silence.  He reaches into a cooler,
     takes out a beer, opens it, takes a drink, then pulls something
     else from the cooler --

     -- a bundle of white butcher's paper.  Sam opens the paper, takes
     out raw meat -- something disgusting to look at -- big red turkey
     necks, maybe, which he tosses into the water.

     ANGLE ON WATER

     as the meat drifts down -- then, a sudden boiling, as -- quick as
     the strike of a snake -- the huge gator EMERGES, jaws wide, to
     snap up the morsel before slipping beneath the surface once mare.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. LAW OFFICE - DAY

     Ken's Secretary opens the inner office door for Baxter.
     Ken rises from a desk to greet him.

                                  KEN
                  Tom Baxter.  Good to see you again.

                                  BAXTER
                  Let's cut the crap.  What does your
                  client want?

                                  KEN
                  Besides an apology?

                                  BAXTER
                  Unless you're planning on leaving Blue
                  Bay, there's gonna be other cases, other
                  days... You might want to keep that in
                  mind.

                                  KEN
                  Okay Tom.  My client wants your client
                  to saddle up... so we can ride her ass
                  all the way to the bank.

     EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY

     A hot morning in June.  Shadows angle across the campus.

     Students line up at the old wooden pagoda, picking up caps and
     gowns.  A few turn, surprised to see...

     SAM LOMBARDO cross the parking lot, ENTERS a building.

     INT. ART'S OFFICE - ART

     working at his desk.  Sam's terrarium is behind him, his
     "Educator of the Year" Waterford bowl, a storage box of files.

     Art looks up at a KNOCK on the DOOR.  Sam walks into the room.
     It is a slightly awkward moment.

                                  SAM
                  Lizards don't seem to miss me.

     The two men smile, breaking the tension.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  How you doing, Artie?

                                  ART
                  I... You know... I...

     Sam waves him off.

                                  SAM
                  Take care of my lizards, Art.

     Art stands up.  The two men shake hands.

     OUTSIDE GUIDANCE OFFICE

     Sam comes out, then stops suddenly.

     Kelly waits for him.  Kirk and Nicole are with her.  A long
     moment.

                                  SAM
                  Kelly...

                                  KELLY
                  Drop dead... You know where my mom is
                  trying to get the money to pay you off?
                  She's trying to break my trust.  How do
                  you like that?  I can't touch it until
                  she's dead and she won't give me a dime
                  and now she's trying to break it to pay
                  you...

                                  SAM
                  Look, Kelly... I'm sorry... I know what
                  you've been through... I should've seen
                  something like this coning.

     Art APPEARS in the door behind Sam.  Kelly cones closer.

                                  KELLY
                  Why don't you start fucking her again.
                  You can spend it together.

     Kirk tries to take Kelly's arm.  She jerks away, swings at Sam.

     He ducks, dropping the Waterford BOWL, which SHATTERS upon the
     floor.

     Kirk bear-hugs Kelly.  She throws a notebook at Sam.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  I hate you!

     She starts crying.  Kirk and Nicole drag her away as a crowd
     gathers.

     Sam, shaken, kneels over the broken crystal.  Art bends to help
     him pick up the pieces.

                                  SAM
                  You see.  I couldn't stay, even if I
                  wanted to.

     EXT. STRIP MALL - NIGHT

     Sam's Jeep is parked next to the T-bird and Jaguar.

     INT. KEN'S OFFICE - SAME

     Baxter, Ken, Sandra, Frankie stand watching, as Sam signs papers.
     At last Sam looks up, faces Sandra -- not a happy moment.

     Sandra gives him a long, hard stare, then walks from the room.
     Frankie prepares to follow her, then stops, looks at Sam.

                                  FRANKIE
                  I'll be seeing you.

     Sam just looks at him.  The big man leaves.  Baxter closes his
     briefcase.

                                  KEN
                  So long, Tom.  Come by sometime.  We'll
                  have lunch at the Beef Bowl.

     Baxter stops, gives him a cold look, then a surprising smile.

                                  BAXTER
                  I don't think you're gonna be eating at
                  the Beef Bowl anymore, kid.

     He EXITS.  Ken goes apeshit -- whoops, dances around the desk,
     drops into his chair, holds up the documents.

     Sam watches, smiling, finally.

                                  SAM
                  Thanks Ken, you did okay.

     Both men stand, they shake hands.  Ken claps him on the arm.

                                  KEN
                         (no clowning now)
                  Look, I know there's a part of you
                  wishes none of this had happened.  But
                  it did.  Now take the money and get out
                  of here.  Find a happy place.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. EVERGLADES - NIGHT

     Moonlit fog -- the vast swamp.

     EXT. GLADES MOTEL - NIGHT

     It's late.  A neon palm tree flashes across an empty lot as...

     Sam's Jeep pulls in out of the night, parks before its bungalow.
     Sam gets out, lifts his storage box of files from the rear.

     INT. BUNGALOW - NIGHT

     The neon's green light slashes across the dark walls through old
     Venetian blinds.

     Sam ENTERS, puts the file box on the floor.  Arches a sore back.

     He reaches for a bedside lamp, stops, listens, decides it's
     nothing, reaches again for the lamp, stops again, listening...

     BZZZZZ -- the high-pitched WHINE of a MOSQUITO.  Then more -- a
     flurry of BZZZZZZZZS

     Sam frowns, sees...

     A cloud of mosquitoes circling him.

     He checks the front windows -- closed.  He goes around the bed.
     The slightly ajar bathroom door with full-length mirror comes up
     on his right.  Ahead is a rear window -- wide open.

     Sam stops fast.
         
     Thinks.  Lets out a breath.

                                  SAM
                  Damn maid.

     He steps to the window.  He looks down --

     Muddy footprints.

     Sam freezes.  He whirls around --

     A sudden green FACE APPEARS in the big mirror -- like a nightmare
     image -- lit by the neon flash, then DISAPPEARS.

     Sam jumps back.

                                  SAM
                  Ahhhh!

     The neon green face flashes again in the mirror -- DISAPPEARS.
     Now the bathroom door slowly opens all the way.

     Sam backs up, hits the wall.

     Kelly Van Ryan steps out of the bathroom, a long object held at
     her side, wrapped in a towel.

                                  SAM
                  Jesus Christ, what are you doing?

                                  KELLY
                  So you got my mom's money.

     Sam tries to breathe, manages a nod.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  How much?

     Kelly prods him with the concealed object.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  How much?

                                  SAM
                  About six and a half million dollars.

     Kelly raises the abject covered by the towel, aims it at Sam.

                                  KELLY
                  Your turn to pay.

     A moment -- then she yanks the towel away to REVEAL --

     --  a two-foot-long novelty penis with giant balls.  Her hand
     grips the acrylic scrotum like the butt of a gun.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  King Dong!  That's you, Sam!

     She screams with joy, vaults into his arms, wraps those perfect
     thighs around him.  The dildo goes flying.  They fall on the bed.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  It worked!  We screwed the bitch!

     She's all over him now -- tongue kisses.

                                  KELLY CCONT'D)
                  It worked just like you said it would.

     He kisses her, finally gets her to sit, straddling him.

                                  SAM
                  God, you scared the shit out of me.  You
                  must be crazy coming here.

                                  KELLY
                  Of course I'm crazy.  Ask my mom.

     She kisses him again, more passionately now.  He gets into it,
     tears her blouse open, putting his tongue to her breasts.

     A SHADOW moves on the wall, looming above them.  Sam sees it, his
     eyes widen.  He tries to sit up, as...

     BANG! -- an EXPLOSION.  Sam jumps, knocks Kelly to his side.

     A champagne cork hits the ceiling.

     Suzie Toller stands over the bed with a foaming champagne bottle.

                                  SUZIE
                  How much is about six and a half million
                  divided by three?

                                  SAM
                  Jesus.  Two million one hundred
                  thirty-three thousand three hundred
                  thirty-three and change.

     Kelly screams in joy again.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  Now calm down.  Both of you.

     The girls put on mock serious expressions.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  From now on, if we're seen together,
                  it's got to be accidental.  I thought
                  that was understood...

                                  KELLY
                  Hey, come on... We've got to have at
                  least one victory party.

     Kelly grabs the champagne, takes a long gulp, pours some on her
     breasts as she straddles Sam once more, inviting him to lick them
     clean.

                                  SAM
                  Kelly, for christ's sake...

     She has begun to move like a lap dancer, inviting him to take her
     breasts in his mouth, putting a hand to his crotch...

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  The only way we're gonna blow this now,
                  is if we do it ourselves...

                                  KELLY
                         (her hand in his crotch)
                  Do it to ourselves?

                                  SAM
                         (weakening)
                  We have to stick with the plan.

                                  KELLY
                  Stick?

     Sam gives up, lays back as Kelly undoes his pants, then moves to
     get him inside her.

     Suzie watches.  She takes another drink, then tosses the bottle,
     pulling off her top, REVEALING her small, white breasts, a couple
     of tattoos, a pierced nipple.  She slips behind Kelly, fondling
     Kelly's breasts as Sam arches beneath them both -- all of them
     totally into it now, losing themselves in the sex...

                                                 FADE TO:

     INT. DETECTIVZS' ROOM, BLUE BAY POLICE STATION - NIGHT

     The room is dark and empty, with the exception of a single desk
     lamp, by which halo we find...

     Ray Duquette, in an aloha shirt, waiting as his computer's
     printer finishes a job, as suddenly...

     ... a new light rushes into the room.  Ray turns to find Gloria
     standing in the doorway.  He stops as his printer finishes the
     job.  He pulls out the paper, looks at it, smiles.  Gloria walks
     to his desk.

                                  RAY
                  You saw the news today?

                                  GLORIA
                  Lombardo's settlement?

     Ray nods.

                                  GLORIA (CONT'D)
                  Yeah, well, I told you they were gonna
                  make us look stupid.

     Ray gives her a long look.  Gloria waits a moment, shrugs.

                                  RAY
                  Hey, don't back away from it, you were
                  right.  We did look stupid.
                         (beat)
                  What you were wrong about, is who made
                  us look that way.

     Gloria just looks at him, puzzled.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  Think back, before the suit was filed,
                  before the trial.  Lombardo had an
                  affair with Sandra, right?
                         (Gloria nods)
                  So why not tell us about the affair?  I
                  mean it could be a hell of a motive for
                  Kelly to fabricate her charge in the
                  first place.

                                  GLORIA
                  Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the
                  affair for the trial.

                                  RAY
                  I thought of that.  Then I said, come
                  on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is
                  getting trashed.  You want to stop the
                  bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail
                  for three months.  Unless...

                                  GLORIA
                  Unless what?

                                  RAY
                  Unless you're setting up Sandra Van Ryan
                  for the big payday.

     It is quiet in the office, save for the soft BUZZ of Ray's
     COMPUTER.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  They chumped us, Gloria, right from the
                  start.

                                  GLORIA
                  Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty
                  good already, nice job in a beautiful
                  setting, popular, an active social life.
                         (beat)
                  He's gonna put this all on the line for
                  some dicey play like what you're
                  describing...

                                  RAY
                         (interrupting)
                  The job looks okay to us.  But look at
                  it from his point of view.  The man's
                  surrounded by wealth and privilege.  But
                  for him... it's just a reminder of what
                  should have been his.

     Gloria gives this a moment's thought.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  Your old man graduates from Blue Bay
                  School, you're not supposed to wind up
                  there.  Board of Directors maybe, but
                  not in the lousy guidance office.  Now.
                  Point number two.
                         (he taps at the printout
                          on his desk)
                  I've run a financial on Lombardo.  Guy
                  was eyeball-deep in debt before this all
                  happened -- trying to keep up with
                  pricey trim like Barbara Baxter.

     He passes the printout to Gloria.  She looks at it, thinking.

                                  GLORIA
                  So what about the girls?  Suzie's poor,
                  but why would Kelly have to steal from
                  her own mother?  Surely her father...

                                  RAY
                         (interrupting)
                  Her father didn't leave her squat.  The
                  kid's got money in trust from her
                  grandfather, but she can't touch that
                  till her mother dies and Sandra seems to
                  have the idea that Kelly ought to learn
                  the value of a buck.

     Gloria looks over Lombardo's financial once more, tosses it on
     the desk, then studies Ray -- long beat.

                                  GLORIA
                  This one's got you working overtime,
                  hasn't it?

                                  RAY
                  I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's
                  dirty.  And I'll tell you something
                  else.  You want to know how old man
                  Lombardo lost his money?
                         (beat)
                  He was fucked out of it by old man Van
                  Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt
                  Creek Land Deal.
                         (beat)
                  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a
                  corporation to develop swamp land, got
                  investors like Lombardo to put up money,
                  then turned around and got the state to
                  declare the area an ecological preserve,
                  on the sly, of course, but everyone knew
                  it was him.  The freeway went to the
                  coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.

                                  GLORIA
                  Eliminate the competition.

                                  RAY
                  You got it.  The rich got richer.  While
                  the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in
                  the swamp.

     Gloria looks at him a long moment.

                                  GLORIA
                  Where'd you come up with this stuff,
                  anyway?

                                  RAY
                         (a long beat; then
                          beneath a smile)
                  I net a guy in a bar.

     EXT. A BANK, BLUE BAY - DAY

     Sam walks down the steps, gets into his Jeep, and drives away.

     Across the street -- the white Taurus -- Ray and Gloria watch.

     EXT. YACHT BROKERAGE - DAY

     Sam comes out, rounds a corner and is gone.

     Ray Duquette steps INTO FRAME, turns into the brokerage.  The
     door swings shut behind him.

     INT. SWIMMING POOL, BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY

     Girls in tank suits finish laps, towel off.  As the girls begin
     to walk toward the lockers, they encounter...

     Ray Duquette, threading his way among the girls, his eye on...

     Kelly, alone on the deck, still dripping -- a Botticelli vision.

                                  RAY (O.S.)
                  Nice stroke.

     Kelly, startled, turns to find Ray walking toward her across the
     deck.  She snatches a towel from one of the racing platforms and
     begins to dry herself, wrapping the towel around her.

                                 KELLY
                  Is there some reason why you're here?

                                 RAY
                  Curiosity, I guess.

                                 KELLY
                  About what?  How to improve your breast
                  stroke?

     Ray gives her a cold smile.

                                 RAY
                  Actually, I was curious about how you
                  see things working out, for you, Sam and
                  Suzie.

     This appears to give her pause, a moment of hesitation.

                                  KELLY
                  Excuse me?

                                  RAY
                  You all gonna go down to the Caribbean
                  together?

     Kelly looks around the pool area.  A number of girls are watching
     from a corner of the deck, but no one is close enough to hear.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  The thing about it is, threesomes so
                  rarely work out.

                                  KELLY
                  You're out of your mind.

                                  RAY
                  I've been a cop for a while, Kelly.
                         (beat)
                  It's hard enough for one person to keep
                  a secret, let alone three.  And then
                  there's the love angle.  I mean do you
                  and Sam really want that little
                  pill-head around, now that you have the
                  money?

     Kelly starts to walk away.  Ray cuts her off.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea
                  right up front, of whacking Suzie?
                  That's murder, Kelly.

                                  KELLY
                  Police -- God -- get a life.

     She moves around him and walks calmly away.

                                  RAY
                         (loud enough to make
                          himself heard)
                  You're good.  But you don't think that
                  little ditz Suzie's gonna hold together,
                  do you?

     Kelly continues to walk, her face giving nothing away, as Ray's
     WORDS ECHO over the pool.

     EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL PARKING LOT - LONG SHOT - LATER

     Only a few cars left -- one of them Suzie's old VW bug, at the
     side of which Kelly and Suzie engage in heated conversation.

     CLOSER - SUZIE

     paces around Kelly.

                                  SUZIE
                  You don't know Duquette.  I'm the one he
                  busted... He's a fucker, man... He'll
                  fuck us both over...

     Kelly tries to take her by the arm.  Suzie jerks away.

                                  SUZIE (CONT'D)
                  I'm not going back to that prison.
                  That's what it was... a fucking hell
                  hole...

     Kelly looks around the lot.  She takes Suzie by the arm once
     more, this time more firmly, pulling Suzie to her.

                                  KELLY
                  Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna
                  come to you just like he did to me.
                  You're gonna have to be ready for him.

                                  SUZIE
                  Yeah, but he can't push you around like
                  he can me.  You've got family and
                  they've got clout.  With we it's
                  different... with me...

                                  KELLY
                         (circling her with her
                          arm)
                  Yeah, I've got family and they've got
                  clout and now you have me.  Right?  And
                  Sam.  Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's
                  not going to send you anywhere.  He's
                  gonna try and rattle your cage, and
                  that's it.  Stay strong and he can't do
                  shit.

                                  SUZIE
                         (a long beat)
                  Man, I wanna smoke a joint.

     PULL BACK to REVEAL -- in the distance -- the white Ford Taurus
     at the side of the road leading to the school.

     The car is pulled just far enough off the road to be mostly
     hidden among pampas grass and oleander, but angled in such a way
     as to afford a view of the two girls now hugging in the lot.

     EXT. SMILIN' JACK'S FISH CAMP - NIGHT

     Suzie wanders along the canal, smoking a joint.  At her back a
     few faint lights flicker here and there in the windows of
     trailers.  She walks down to the little dock, sits on a rail,
     takes another hit.

                                  VOICE (0.S.)
                  'Evening, Suzie.  How was school today?

     Suzie freezes, holds back her exhale, looking around...

     A shadow stirs in one of the skiffs tied to the dock.  A man
     stands, walks up the couple of wooden stairs.  The light from a
     trailer across the road glances off steel-rimmed glasses as Ray
     Duquette steps onto the dock.

     Suzie gags on the smoke in her lungs, coughs.  She squeezes the
     lit roach into her palm, then tosses it into the canal.

                                  RAY
                  You ought to watch it with that shit,
                  Suzie.  You get busted again, you go
                  back in a two-tine loser.

                                  SUZIE
                  You got something against cigarettes?

     Ray just laughs at her.

                                  RAY
                  Yeah, they're bad for your health.
                         (beat)
                  I'm tryin' to look out for you...

                                  SUZIE
                  That's cop bullshit.

                                  RAY
                  Well, you're half right.  Best thing you
                  could do for yourself right now would be
                  to talk to me.

                                  SUZIE
                  About what?

                                  RAY
                  Every triangle I've ever seen never
                  lasts.  Somebody's got to go.

                                  SUZIE
                  Is this supposed to mean something to
                  me?  What triangle?

                                  RAY
                  You, Kelly, Sam.

                                  SUZIE
                  I don't have to listen to this.  And you
                  can't shove me around.  I have friends
                  now...

     She catches herself, falters.

     Ray laughs once more.

                                  RAY
                  Is that what you think?  You have
                  friends?  Is that what they told you?

                                  SUZIE
                  I don't mean who you're thinking.  I
                  have other friends...

                                  RAY
                  Suzie, Suzie... This is me, Ray, you're
                  talking to.  We both know you don't have
                  shit, never have had shit, never will
                  have shit...

     He takes a sheet of paper from his coat.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  Here, Suzie.  I want you :o look this
                  over.  Know what it is?
                         (as Suzie takes it)
                  Sam deposited his check, transferred the
                  funds to an offshore bank, a numbered
                  account.  Not even the cops can find out
                  whose names are on it.  Think one of
                  them's yours?

     Suzie looks over the paper.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  He also put a down on some island
                  property, and a lease-to-buy on a
                  forty-foot sailboat.  You're into
                  sailing, aren't you, Suzie?

     Suzie thrusts the paper back at Ray.

                                  SUZIE
                  Get away from me.

                                  RAY
                  Don't you see what this means?  You
                  really think Sam and Kelly are gonna
                  give you a third of the money?  You, the
                  pill-head with the rap sheet?

                                  SUZIE
                  Shut up.

     Ray smiles at her.  He moves up close.

                                  RAY
                  You know, I don't think I ever told you
                  I was sorry about your little friend...
                  What was his name?

     Suzie tries to back away.  She bumps against the rail.  Ray
     reaches out, takes her hand in both of his.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  Come on, Suzie, help me out here.  You
                  know his name.

     Suzie looks scared, in a way she hasn't before.  When she speaks
     her voice is scarcely above a whisper.

                                  SUZIE
                  Davy.

                                  RAY
                         (nodding, a scary smile)
                  That's right.  That was his name.

     The smile fades, as if he's thinking about something, still
     holding her hand, rubbing it with his fingers.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  Sometimes I wonder if you're really as
                  dumb as you pretend to be.

     He looks into Suzie's eyes, slowly opening her hand to REVEAL the
     burn mark on her palm.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  But you know what?  I'd be keeping a
                  clear mind right now if I were you.
                         (beat)
                  I'd hate to see you come to a bad end.
                  Like Davy did.

     He holds her hand a moment longer, then drops it.  He goes back
     down he steps to the little skiff.  An outboard MOTOR STARTS in
     the night.

     INT. SUZIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Suzie cones in fast, grabs the phone, punches out a number.

                                  SAM (V.0.)
                         (answering machine)
                  This is Sam.  I'm not in right now...

     EXT./INT. RAY'S PICKUP - NIGHT

     parked behind some cottonwoods in a small launch area where the
     highway crosses both the canal and the road to the fish camp.

     The skiff has been shoved into the bed.  Ray sits at the wheel.
     He removes his glasses, wipes his face with a handkerchief, then
     starts at the uneven 50UNDS of a tired ENGINE, looks up to see...

     HEADLIGHTS

     Suzie's VW bouncing along the dirt road, turning onto the
     highway.

     RAY'S TRUCK - RAY

     watching, then starting his truck and pulling out onto the
     highway, following the tiny red lights of Suzie's bug.

     SXT. VAN RYAN ESTATE - MAIN GATE - NIGHT

     Suzie's VW idles.  She leans out the window, talks to the
     intercom, the gate opens.  The VW ENTERS.  The gate closes.

     Ray's pickup drives past.  He drives to a big lot where one of
     the mansions has been torn down.  He drives up onto the dirt,
     keeps going, right down to the water's edge where he pulls his
     little skiff out of the back once more.

     He walks back to the truck, pulls off his sport coat, hangs a
     Hi-8 video camera over his shoulder and wades out into the calm
     waters of the bay, pushing the skiff, then climbing in.

     EXT. VAN RYAN ESTATE, REAR OF MAIN HOUSE - NIGHT

     Suzie follows Kelly past the pool, which is all lit~up, and on
     toward the jacuzzi.  The whole deck is tiled in black-and-white.

     Kelly's in a bikini -- the killer body.  Suzie, the contrast --
     pale, skinny, boyish, in a T-shirt and cutoff jeans.  They
     argue -- we CANNOT HEAR.

     EXT. THE BAY - SAME

     Ray has arrived near the docks.  He has killed his engine,
     maneuvering here with a single oar.  He ties the skiff off behind
     the Jonathan, then climbs to the dock, moving around the guest
     house and coming close to the pool.  He takes a position behind
     the cabanas, readies his camera.

     EXT. POOL AREA - SAME

     Kelly and Suzie continue their argument in front of the jacuzzi.

                                  KELLY
                  I can't believe you called Sam.  What's
                  the matter with you?

                                  SUZIE
                  I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared
                  there's no one to trust.

                                  KELLY
                  You can trust me.

     A cordless PHONE RINGS on the patio chair.  Kelly and Suzie are
     startled by it.  Kelly answers.

     INT. SAM'S BUNGALOW - NIGHT

     The bedside lamp is on.  Sam is on the phone.

                                  SAM
                  Kelly.  Is Suzie there?

                                  KELLY (V.O.)
                  Yes.

                                  SAM
                  Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left
                  this garbled message on my machine.
                         (beat)
                  Can you calm her down?

                                  KELLY (V.0.)
                  Why can't you come...

                                  SAM
                  No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm
                  counting on you.  You calm her down.
                  I mean do whatever you have to, whatever
                  it takes...

                                  KELLY (V.O.)
                  You know what it takes.

                                  SAM
                  Then do it.  I need you on this Kelly.
                  Do it tonight.  We'll figure something
                  out... Okay?

     EXT. JACUZZI - NIGHT

     Kelly glances across the steamy water at Suzie.

                                  KELLY
                  Yeah, right.  Can you at least talk to
                  her, on the phone?

     NT. SAM'S BUNGALOW - SAME

     Sam lies on his bed, waits for Suzie's voice on the line.

                                  SUZIE (V.O.)
                  Sam...

                                  SAM
                  Put Kelly on too.

     EXT. JACUZZI - SAME

     The girls stand cheek-to-cheek, the phone between them.

                                  KELLY
                  I'm here.

     INT. SAM'S BUNGALOW - SAME

                                  SAM
                  Okay.  I want you to hear this too.
                  We've got to be cool.  All of us.
                  People think I'm rich, for Christ's
                  sake.   I'm doing what rich guys do.
                         (beat)
                  I'm spending my money.  It's more
                  suspicious if I sit around doing
                  nothing.  Now don't let this cop fuck
                  with your minds.

     EXT. CABANAS - NIGHT

     Ray tapes the scene.

     The girls still hold the phone.

                                  SUZIE
                  But I..

                                  SAM (V.0.)
                  Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only
                  people who can blow this is us.
                  Remember?

                                  KELLY
                  Right.

     Suzie says nothing.  Kelly nudges her.

                                  SUZIE
                  Yeah, right.

                                  SAM (V.0.)
                  Good.  Just keep telling yourselves
                  that, the only people who can fuck this
                  up is us.

     The line goes dead.  Kelly hangs up.  Suzie stares into the
     jacuzzi.

                                  SUZIE
                  You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?

                                  KELLY
                  Oh, for Christ's sake.

                                  SUZIE
                  You are.

                                  KELLY
                  Are you retarded, or just brain dead
                  from whiffin' fumes out there in the
                  swamp...

     Suzie's face goes hard.

                                  SUZIE
                  That's what I am to you, isn't it?
                  Swamp trash.  It's what I am to
                  everybody, just like my mom...

     Kelly tries to put an arm around her.  Suzie slaps her -- a
     mistake -- Kelly's bigger, faster.  She slaps the side of Suzie's
     head, then grabs her legs, dumping her on the tile deck.

     ON RAY

     focusing the camera.

     Suzie tries to kick Kelly.

     Something changes in Kelly, a scary, calm rage.

                                  KELLY
                  Stupid bitch.

     She very methodically grabs Suzie's hair, dragging her into the
     jacuzzi, holding her under the hot water.

     Suzie thrashes, breaks free, gags, arches out of the water, the
     wet T-shirt clinging to her small breasts.

     Kelly is on her again, slaps her, puts her hands to Suzie's
     throat -- violently sexual in her wet bikini.

     Kelly slams Suzie back onto the black-and-white tile, gets on top
     of her, knees between Suzie's legs, her hands on her throat.

     Suzie's skinny shape writhes underneath Kelly on the gleaming
     tile.  She gasps for air.  Kelly finally lets go, but remains on
     her knees between Suzie's legs, breathing hard.  A moment.  Kelly
     touches Suzie's face.

                                  KELLY
                  Why do you make me hurt you?  It's like
                  you want it or something.

     Suzie sobs, takes Kelly's hand.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  God, you are scared, aren't you?

     Suzie runs her lips over Kelly's fingers, then pushes her T-shirt
     up, pushing Kelly's hand onto her breast.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  And this is going to make you feel
                  better, make you trust me...

     Suzie nods, tearing her T-shirt, getting both of Kelly's hands
     onto her breasts, then pushing at Kelly's wrists, getting her to
     pull at her nipples, hard... Kelly obliges...

     Suzie cries out in pain.  Kelly's hands move down to pull off
     Suzie's bottoms...

     ON RAY

     still at it with the video, his face impassive, watching.

     As Kelly pulls Suzie back into the jacuzzi, as the girls' hands
     slide round the curves of each other's hips, pulling themselves
     to each other, as the layers of steam rise to envelope them...

                                                 CUT TO:

     VIDEOTAPE

     Kelly and Suzie making love in the jacuzzi.

     PULL BACK to REVEAL --

     INT. POLICE ROOM - DAY

     Gloria, Ray, Hunter watch the tape.  Hunter's seen enough.  He
     slams the stop/tape.

                                  HUNTER
                  Are you crazy, Ray?

                                  RAY
                  You heard Kelly say "Sam."  That was
                  Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the
                  girls...

                                  HUNTER
                  Ray.  The conversation on this tape is
                  totally unintelligible.
                         (beat)
                  What we have here, is you on the Van
                  Ryan property, without a proper warrant,
                  shooting a porn flick...

                                  RAY
                  I don't believe I'm hearing this.  A
                  month ago you were pulling these two
                  apart at the courthouse.
                         (beat)
                  They were acting.  They were all acting,
                  from the beginning.  And we bought it,
                  hook, line and sinker... And now they're
                  home free with six million of Sandra Van
                  Ryan's money.

                                  GLORIA
                  Which she might have saved, if she
                  hadn't set out to destroy the man's
                  life.

                                  RAY
                         (turning now on Gloria)
                  What?  You wouldn't go after some guy
                  you thought raped your daughter?
                         (beat)
                  Cone on.  She bought the same story we
                  did...

     Ray stops as Hunter brings the palm of his hand down on the table
     a loud SLAP.

                                  HUNTER
                  Listen, both of you.  You're not on a
                  case.  There is no fucking case.
                         (beat)
                  I've had it up to here with Sandra Van
                  Ryan.  Ray, you keep mucking around like
                  this and you are going to have her suing
                  us for invasion of privacy.  Get out of
                  these people's lives.
                         (beat)
                  Am I getting through on this?

     Ray walks to the door, jerks it open --

     INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

     Sam, angry, sits in the corridor with a uniformed officer.

     Hunter sees Sam, rolls his eyes.

                                  HUNTER
                  Oh, Ray... no...

                                  RAY
                  You think this is just about money,
                  about us looking foolish?  Question him.
                  You're gonna find a stone cold
                  manipulative psychopath.  And those
                  girls are going to wind up dead...

     Sam lunges at Ray.  The officer and Hunter restrain him.  Gloria
     looks on, taken aback by Ray's accusations, Sam's response.

                                  HUNTER
                  Mr. Lombardo, please.  I'm sorry about
                  this.

                                  SAM
                  Give this idiot something to do.  Let
                  him look into the Kennedy assassination.

     Ray flares, grabs Sam, shoves him against the wall, before they
     can be separated once again.

                                  SAM (CCNT'D)
                         (to Hunter)
                  Next time this guy drags me down here,
                  I'll sue you.  You're goddamn lucky I
                  didn't sue you the first time!

     Sam storms from the room, followed by Hunter.  Ray stares after
     them, finally he turns, looks at Gloria, collecting himself.

                                  RAY
                  Guess I kind of lost it there.

                                  GLORIA
                  You could say that.

                                  RAY
                  Were you ever in a situation where you
                  could see a thing coming and you didn't
                  do what you could to stop it?

     Gloria studies Ray, clearly concerned.

                                  GLORIA
                  We all have...

                                  RAY
                  I mean something bad, Gloria, something
                  bad you saw coning, and you didn't do
                  anything, and then it happened.
                         (off Gloria's silence)
                  I did that once.  I don't want to do it
                  again.

     EXT. MALL ENTRANCE - LATE AFTERNOON

     Sam EXXTS a building, a large package of wrapped goods beneath
     his arm.  He looks toward the parking lot where --

     Barbara Baxter stands beside the red Mercedes.  She tips a valet
     then starts toward the mall.  She sees San.  Their eyes meet.  A
     moment of hesitation, as neither is quite sure what to say.

                                  SAM
                  You look pretty.

                                  BARBARA
                  Thanks.

     Sam smiles.  She points to the stuff beneath his arm.

                                  BARBARA (CONT'D)
                  Quite a shopping spree...

     She's kidding, then seems to consider how Sam might take it.

                                  BARBARA (CONT'D)
                  I didn't mean...

     Sam laughs it off.

                                  SAM
                  Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend
                  it, right?  I've always wanted to live
                  where I could dive for my dinner.

                                  BARBARA
                  And where might that be?

                                  SAM
                  I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.

                                  BARBARA
                  I love Antigua.
                         (beat)
                  Maybe I'll come visit you.

                                  SAM
                  I'd like that.

     A moment, she touches his face.  Sam raises a hand to cover hers,
     as...

     ... in b.g., a BLACK RANGE ROVER -- just the roof VISIBLE above
     the tops of the other cars, cruises the lot.

     INT. RANGE ROVER - KELLY VAN RYAN

     seated at the wheel, parks, stares toward the mall entrance.

     ANGLE ON ENTRANCE - KELLY'S POV

     Sam and Barbara stand in the orange light, hand-in-hand.  Barbara
     leans forward, kisses Sam on the lips.

     CLOSE ON KELLY

     lost in thought, when she is startled by a sudden CACOPHONY of
     ENGINE NOISE.  She turns to find...

     Suzie's BUG, SPLUTTERING and BELCHING smoke, parks next to her.

     Suzie opens the door of the Rover, jumps in.  She's wearing a
     black ball cap, armed with a huge straw bag.  As she settles in
     the seat, she lets out a long breath.

     Kelly makes a face, fans the air.

                                  KELLY
                  Jesus.  What are you drinking?

     Suzie laughs, pulls a bottle of Mad Dog 20/20 from the bag.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                         (looking at the bottle)
                  Anybody ever tell you that stuff will
                  rot your brain?

                                  SUZIE
                  What brain?

     Suzie takes a big drink.  Kelly shakes her head, looks back
     toward the entrance.

     ANGLE ON ENTRANCE - KELLY'S POV

     empty.  Sam and Barbara are gone.

     Kelly continues to stare.

                                  SUZIE
                  What are you looking at?

                                  KELLY
                         (starting the car)
                  Nothing.

     EXT. THE BEACH - NIGHT

     The Atlantic rolls before a long stretch of empty sand as the
     last red light drains from the sky.

     The Range Rover comes down onto the sand, parks.

     INT./EXT. RANGE ROVER - SAME

     Kelly turns off the engine.  Suzie tokes on a joint, swills the
     MD 20/20.  She gazes upon the sea, eyes at half-mast.

                                  SUZIE
                  I thought we were goin' to a movie.

                                  KELLY
                  I think we just need to get wasted.

     Suzie shrugs, gets out.  Kelly gets out with her.  Suzie
     staggers.  Kelly circles her with an arm, looks nervously around,
     begins leading her down the beach.

                                  SUZIE
                  I wanna live at the beach someday.

                                  KELLY
                  Shit.

     She stops walking.  Suzie takes a few more steps then turns to
     look at her.

                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
                  I left the keys.  I'll get 'em.

     Suzie plops down on the sand, drinks from the bottle.  She
     watches Kelly fading into the darkness, mumbles something beneath
     her breath, then lies on her back.

     SUZIE'S POV - THE NIGHT SKY

     The SOUND of CRASHING WAVES.  She rolls to one side, looking down
     the beach

     Murky blackness.

     She tries to focus, sits up.

                                  SUZIE
                  Kelly?

     She stands -- wobbly -- peers down the beach.

     A shape EMERGES in the blackness, moving toward her.

                                  SUZIE (CONT'D)
                  Kelly?

     The shape gets closer and closer, until...

     Sam Lombardo steps up to loom over Suzie.

     She takes a step back.

     Sam puts a hand on her shoulder.  He carries something in his
     other hand -- hard to see on the dark beach.

                                  SAM
                  Suzie, it's okay.  It's me.

     Suzie steadies herself.  A face APPEARS behind Sam -- Kelly.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  I was worried about you, Suzie.  I
                  decided we should all get together, one
                  more time, before we split up.

                                  SUZIE
                  Are you mad at me?

                                  SAM
                  No, no.  Look, I probably should have
                  told you a little more, about the part I
                  intended to play.
                         (beat)
                  We'll go through it all again tonight.

     Sam takes the bottle from Suzie, looks at it.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  This is a celebration Suzie, not a
                  suicide pact.

     He lifts the object in his other hand -- a champagne battle.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  We'll chill out first, have a drink,
                  watch the stars.

     Suzie nods.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  Kelly, there's a beach blanket in the
                  Jeep.  Could you get it for us?

     Kelly nods, starts back, looks once over her shoulder as...

     Sam leads Suzie toward a huge rock formation.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  Let me tell you about this boat I picked
                  out for us...

     They move OUT OF SIGHT.  Kelly continues to walk, back along the
     sand toward the cars.

     INSERT - A SCREAM

     A sickening hollow THWACK -- an arc of blood and two teeth fall
     silently on dark stone.

     Kelly begins to run, stumbling through the sand to Sam's Jeep,
     where she pulls a big roll of clear plastic from behind the
     seats.  She stuffs it under her arm, then runs back along the
     beach.  As she runs, she can hear them -- more THWACKS, MOANS --
     it seems like forever

     Sam APP£ARS before her on the sand.  The champagne bottle swings
     loosely at the end of one arm.  it looks shiny now, dripping with
     Suzie's blood.

     Kelly goes to him.  She looks at the bottle, then throws herself
     against him -- a hard kiss.

                                  SAM
                  I'm sorry, Kelly.  I'm sorry it had to
                  happen like this.  She was losing it...

                                  KELLY
                         (breathless)
                  There was no way.  That cop would've
                  gotten her to tell him... everything.
                  She was weak and dumb...

     She kisses him again, her hands moving over his body.  Sam takes
     a step back, looks into Kelly's face -- the parted lips, sultry
     eyes -- as if seeing her for the first time -- a long beat -- at
     which point he turns, heaving the champagne bottle as far as he
     can into the black waves.

     EXT. RANGE ROVER ON THE SAUD - LATER

     Rear hatch open -- overhead light on.

     Sam and Kelly drag Suzie's body -- wrapped in the plastic -- to
     the rear hatch.  As they heft her inside, the light catches --

     SUZIE'S FACE

     A mask of blood.

     Kelly turns away in disgust.  She goes to the passenger side
     door, gets in.

     Sam gets in behind the wheel.  For a moment the two of them just
     sit there, in the darkness, with the SOUND of the SEA, and their
     own BREATHING.  Sam looks at Kelly.

     She is focused on the dark Atlantic.

                                  SAM
                  Are you okay?

     Kelly turns to him -- an anxious face.

                                  KELLY
                         (a long beat)
                  My mom would kill me if she knew I took
                  the Rover.

     EXT. EVERGLADES - NIGHT

     Kelly waits by the Rover, swatting mosquitoes.

     SLOSHING SOUNDS -- a shape approaches in the dark -- Sam in
     waders, muddy, tired, carrying a shovel.

     EXT. GALLERIA PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     Almost empty of cars.  The Range Rover cruises past Suzie's VW,
     circles, comes back.  Sam jumps out, pulls on latex gloves, gets
     into the VW and backs it out.

     EXT. BUS TERMINAL (MIAMI) - DAY

     Almost dawn.  A long parking lot fronts the terminal.  Suzie's VW
     arrives, parks, Sam gets out.  He goes to the waiting Range
     Rover, gets in and drives away.

     EXT. FRONT GATE - VAN RYAN ESTATE - DAY

     A THIN STREAM OF MUDDY WATER

     flows beneath the gate, down the drive, toward the street.

     A HAND touches the water.

     PULL BACK to REVEAL the hand as that of Ray Duquette.

     EXT. VAN RYAN DRIVEWAY - SAME

     Ray kneels, fingers wriggling in the water, then straightens,
     looking toward the house where...

     On the other side of the gate, Kelly, in a tube-top and tight
     shorts, washes mud from the Range Rover.  She looks up, sees...

     Ray, drying his hand on a handkerchief, walking up the drive,
     arriving at the wrought-iron gates.

                                  RAY
                  Been four-wheelin'?

     Kelly freezes -- not so cool this time.

                                  KELLY
                  Get off my property.

                                  RAY
                  I'm not on your property!

     He grabs the wrought-iron gate -- rattles it -- harder and
     harder.

     Kelly backs away, frightened.

     EXT. SMILIN' JACK'S FISH CAMP - DAY

     Gloria and Ray stand in front of the ramshackle wooden building,
     talking to Ruby.  Walter sits nearby, sharpening a knife.

                                  RAY
                  You say she didn't come back last night.

                                  RUBY
                  She's been sayin' she was going to go to
                  L.A.  But I don't know.  I mean all her
                  clothes are still here.  An' she's
                  missin' her graduation.
                         (a long beat)
                  She should graduate.  She's a smart
                  girl...

     Ray nods.  He makes a note in his pad.

                                  RAY
                  May have been she just partied too
                  much... But we'll look into it.  We find
                  something, you'll be the first to know.

     Ray turns and walks to the car.  Gloria follows.

     INT. CAR - SAME

     Ray sits for a moment behind the wheel.

                                  RAY
                  It's starting, Gloria.  This is how it
                  begins...

                                  GLORIA
                  Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She
                  could be anywhere...

     Ray silences her with a look.

                                  RAY
                  I'm gonna take you back to the office.
                  Will you put out a call on Suzie's car
                  for me?

                                  GLORIA
                  You have someplace to be?

     Ray starts the car, doesn't answer.

                                  GLORIA (CONT'D)
                  If you want company...

                                  RAY
                  Just check out the car.

     Gloria nods.  She looks toward the camp store where the old lady
     can still be SEEN standing on the porch, beneath the jawbones.

     EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY

     Caps and gowns -- kids and parents on the lawn -- taking photos.

     Kelly poses with Sandra.  Tom Baxter aims the camera.

                                  BAXTER
                  Smile.

                  That's one for the scrapbook.

     Baxter moves away, greets Nicole and her parents.

     Kelly puts some room between her and Sandra.

                                  KELLY
                  You didn't have to fly back -- from --
                  wherever, for me...

                                  SANDRA
                  I'm here to congratulate my friends and
                  their children.  I'm leaving again
                  tonight.

                                  KELLY
                  Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.

                                  SANDRA
                  Where, the mall?

                                  KELLY
                  A friend of mine bought a boat.

     Sandra shakes her head, walks off.

     Kelly turns away, freezes, as she catches sight of --

     Ray talking with Jimmy.

     EXT. THE BEACH - DAY

     Ray and Jimmy walk along the sand, moving in the direction of the
     big rocks.  Jimmy wears sagger shorts, a surfer T-shirt.  Ray
     wears a suit.  He carries the coat over his shoulder.

                                  JIMMY
                  It's those rocks, up there.

                                  RAY
                  You and Suzie used to come out here
                  together?

                                  JIMMY
                  Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang
                  out here.
                         (beat)
                  You really think something bad happened
                  to Suzie?

                                  RAY
                         (ignoring the question)
                  Lombardo ever come out here?

     Jimmy looks at him, surprised, sees that Ray is serious.  Still,
     the idea generates a laugh.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  I say something funny?

                                  JIMMY
                  No.  But I mean... just the idea that
                  Mr. Lombardo would...

                                  RAY
                  Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with
                  the kids, one of the guys...

                                  JIMMY
                  Yeah, but...

     He breaks off as Ray kneels over a big flat rock.  Ray brushes
     away some sand, drapes the sport coat over his arm, taking
     tweezers and latex gloves from the pockets.

     Jimmy moves closer, curious, seeing what Ray sees.

     CLOSE ON GLOVED HANDS

     as tweezers pick up two teeth from a crevice in the stone.

     Ray straightens, holding the teeth in the palm of his hand.

     Jimmy stares at the teeth.

     Ray takes a couple of bills from his pocket, hands them to Jimmy.

                                  RAY
                  I'm going to be staying here, Jimmy.
                  You can catch a bus up there at the lot,
                  okay?

     Jimmy looks a little sick, but he takes the money.  He starts
     toward the lot.

     Ray watches for a moment.  Then calls out to him.

                                  RAY
                  People aren't always what they appear to
                  be, kid.  Remember it.

     Jimmy looks at him, trying to make sense of what Ray is saying,
     clearly disturbed by the implications.  But he asks no more
     questions.  He turns, trudging alone back through the sand.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. OCEAN COVE - LATER

     THE TEETH go into a plastic bag.

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL

     Black-and-whites, county cars -- police tape across the site.

     Ray, Gloria and Hunter watch as DAVE MERRITT, a forensic expert
     bags the teeth.  He passes the bag to Ray, then bends to the
     rocks where he begins to take a blood sample.

                                  RAY
                  Lonbardo and Kelly killed her here.

     Hunter and Gloria exchange a look.

                  Two kids could've gotten into a fight,

                                  RAY
                  Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.

                  The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a
                  swamp rat, knows the body will never be
                  found there.  But he's made a mistake.

     He holds up the evidence bag containing the teeth.

                                  GLORIA
                  Her grandmother said she'd been
                  threatening to run away.  And I found
                  the car at the Miami bus terminal.

                                  RAY
                  You don't think Sam could've put it
                  there?

                                  HUNTER
                  Dust it for prints.  My guess is, if
                  anybody murdered Suzie it was probably
                  that little sociopath Kelly Van Ryan.

     Ray shakes his head; he turns to Dave, still working.

                                  RAY
                  How soon can we get something?

                                  DAVE
                  We can get blood type right away.
                  Dental records will take longer.  You
                  want DNA, that can take weeks.

     Ray nods, looks out to sea.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.

                                  GLORIA
                  We don't know that, Ray...

     Ray turns to her -- an intense look.

                                  RAY
                  Kelly's next, Gloria.

                                  HUNTER
                         (ice cold)
                  Get off this Ray, now.
                         (beat)
                  If there is any evidence here, it's for
                  Homicide.
                         (turning to Dave)
                  You get an ID, you call me.

     Dave nods.  Hunter stalks off toward his car.  Ray turns to
     Gloria.

                                  RAY
                  Will you do me one favor?

                                  GLORIA

                  What if I'm right, Gloria?  What if I'm
                  right and Hunter's wrong?
                         (beat)
                  What do you do if you see a bad thing
                  coming?

     Gloria looks toward the highway, trying to decide.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  Stick with me on this Gloria.  I need
                  you...

                                  GLORIA
                  And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll

                  If I'm wrong about those teeth -- it's a
                  promise.

     EXT. GLADES MOTEL - SUNSET

     Sam's Jeep -- a "FOR SALE" sign in the window -- sits in the lot.

     Across the road -- Gloria sits in the white Taurus.

     EXT. VAN RYAN ESTATE, MAIN GATE - SUNSET

     Ray sits in his truck, picks up his cellular, punches in a
     number.

                                  DAVE (V.0.)
                  Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the

                                  RAY
                  What about the blood?

                         (a beat)
                  Could be hers.  Types match.  Could be a

                         (cutting him off)
                  Second you get something on those teeth,
                  I want it

     Ray hangs up without waiting for a reply.  He turns to the Van
     Ryan house, an orange light slanting across its facade.

     EXT. GLADES MOTEL - NIGHT

     Gloria waits in her car.  She looks toward the motel.

     Sam's Jeep is parked before one of the bungalows.  There is a
     light on in the room.  We can SEE inside.

     Gloria sighs, picks up a pair of binoculars and trains them on
     the room.

     ANGLE ON ROOM - GLORIA'S POV

     Suitcases and boxes are stacked everywhere.  Sam, bare-chested,
     in khaki slacks, moves about the room.

     CLOSE ON GLORIA

     watching Sam, as...

     IN THE ROOM

     The PHONE has begun to RING.  Sam looks at it until it stops,
     then picks it up and dials a number.  Kelly answers.

                                  KELLY (V.O.)
                  Hello?

                  God, I've been calling you.

     INTERCUT - KELLY/SAM PHONE CONVERSATION

     Kelly is in the guest house, pacing in front of the gun case.

                                  KELLY
                  I'm really serious.  That cop, he keeps
                  watching me.

                                  SAM
                  Duquette.  Forget him...

                                  KELLY
                  I can't help it.  He gives me the
                  creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared
                  of him?  She's not that way.  I think he
                  did something...

                                  SAM
                  Yeah, he got her busted for
                  possession...

                                  KELLY
                  I don't know... I think it was something
                  else... Suzie says the bust was
                  bullshit...

                                  SAM
                  And you believe her?

                                  KELLY
                         (a long beat -- a sigh)
                  I don't know.
                         (beat)
                  I want to see you...

                                  SAM
                  Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's
                  valium or something.  In another week
                  you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're
                  rich.

                                  KELLY
                  But what if they find out... God, they'd
                  put you in the gas chamber...

     Sam is about to respond, then looks out the window, sees...

     ACROSS THE STREET, the white Taurus.

                                  SAM
                  So if they're tapping your phone, we're
                  dead.  Stay in the guest house.  Skip
                  the graduation parties.  You'll never
                  see Duquette.  Okay?  I love you.

                                  KELLY
                         (beat)
                  Okay.  I love you too.

     for a moment, then begins to write something on a pad.

     She's still at it when something KNOCKS at a FENDER.  She looks
     up, startled, to find...

     Sam in the street, still shirtless, his arms and shoulders
     back-lit by the neon light of the Glades Motel.

                                  SAM

                                  SAM
                  Maybe she used another name.

                  Come here.  I want you to see something.

     Gloria hesitates, looks up at Sam, then puts down the phone and
     opens her door.

     Sam nods.  He goes to one of his cardboard filing boxes, pulls
     out a file, hands it to Gloria.  As she takes it, he goes to the
     closet, takes a shirt from a hanger.

                                  SAM
                  Kelly's file.  Read it.  You're going to

                  You're telling me Ray thinks Suzie was

                  Then -- I still had ethical standards to
                  protect.  They meant a lot to me.  Now,
                  I don't care.  And no amount of money
                  can buy that back.

     Sam is interrupted by the HONKING of a HORN.  He looks outside.

     ANGLE ON LOT - SAM'S POV

     A taxi waits in the glow of the green neon.

     Sam looks down on Gloria, seated on his bed, her skirt short
     enough to REVEAL shapely legs.  For a moment the two hold one
     another's eyes.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  My ride.  If you're not planning on
                  arresting me, that is.

     INT. RAY'S TRUCK - NIGHT - LATER

     The PHONE RINGS.  Ray picks it up.

                                  RAY
                  Ray.  What's happening?

     INTERCUT - RAY/GLORIA PHONE CONVERSATION

     She's still in Sam's room, the file spread across the bed.

                                  GLORIA
                  I'm tired, Ray.  I'm going home.

                                  RAY
                  Where's Lombardo?

                                  GLORIA
                  He's leaving the country.  And I don't
                  give a shit.

                                  RAY
                  The blood type on the rocks matches
                  Suzie's.

                                  GLORIA
                  It's Homicide's job now, Ray, let 'em do
                  it.  I'll tell you something else,
                  there's more to this story than you
                  know, Ray... If Suzie is dead, I think
                  Hunter may be on the right track...

     Ray clicks off his phone.

                                  GLORIA (CONT'D)
                  Ray?
                         (nothing but dial tone)
                  Shit.  Ray.

     EXT. VAN RYAN ESTATE, FRONT GATE - NIGHT

     Ray gets out of his car, presses the intercom.

                                  SANDRA (V.O.)
                         (intercom)
                  Who is it?

                                  RAY
                         (into intercom)
                  Detective Duquette, Ms. Van Ryan.  Let
                  me in.  Now.

     EXT. POOL & JACUZZI - NIGHT

     Ray CROSSES the deck, Sandra at his heels.

                                  RAY
                  Where is she?

                                  SANDRA
                  Where she lives.  In the guest house.
                  Now will you tell me what this is about?

                                  RAY
                  I'm placing your daughter under arrest.

                                  SANDRA
                  You can't...

                                  RAY
                         (turning, cutting her
                          off)
                  Suzie Toller is dead.  You don't want
                  Kelly to be next, then take my advice.
                  Stay out of my way.

     INT. GUEST HOUSE - SAME

     A cap and gown lay strewn on the sofa.

     Kelly wears jeans and a bra.  She looks up to see Ray moving
     across the tile.  Her eyes go wide, then move to the gun case.

     EXT. GUEST HOUSE - SAME

     Sandra stands near the jacuzzi, not exactly sure what to do,
     watching as...

     ANGLE ON GUEST HOUSE - SANDRA'S POV

     Ray knocks at the French door.  It swings open.  He steps inside.

     A long moment, then VOI?ES, the SOUND of things being knocked
     about, BREAKING GLASS.

     Sandra starts toward the house then stops at the SOUND of a
     single GUNSHOT.

     A SECOND GUNSHOT follows, then a THIRD.

     The guest house door opens.  Ray stumbles out, his shoulder
     bloody, a .357 in his hand.

                                                 FADE TO:

     VIDEOTAPE - RAY'S STATEMENT

     We SEE him from the waist up -- a white T-shirt, his shoulder
     bandaged, his arm in a sling.  There are red scratch marks on his
     face.  His eyes look blankly into the camera.

                                  RAY
                  I fucked up.  I lost control of the
                  situation, the one thing they train you
                  for... God, what did I do?

                                  HUNTER (0.S.)
                  Just tell us what happened.

                                  RAY
                  I told Kelly Van Ryan she was under
                  arrest for conspiracy and murder.  I did
                  her rights.

     INTERCUT --

     EXT. CARIBBEAN BEACH RESORT - LONG SHOT - DAY

     Perfect crescent of sand.  A man in white shorts reclines in a
     beach chair, beneath a gaily-colored umbrella, sipping a drink.

     VIDEOTAPE - RAY

                                  RAY
                  Kelly went crazy, started screaming.  I
                  grabbed her, put her on the floor.

     EXT. BEACH RESORT - CLOSER SHOT - DAY

     Sam, in white shorts, looking good, watches a beautiful island
     girl in a thong bikini frolic in the surf.

     She seems to sense Sam watching, turns toward the beach.  Her
     eyes meet Sam's.  She breaks into a beautiful smile.

     VIDEOTAPE - RAY

                                  HUNTER (O.S.)
                  She bit you?

                                  RAY
                  Bit, scratched.  But I had her pinned.
                  She calmed down.  I was going to cuff
                  her... She said she thought she was
                  going to be sick.  She asked to use the
                  bathroom.

     EXT. BEACH RESORT - DAY

     Sam and the island girl sit at an outdoor table.  The girl wears
     a short, terry cloth robe, Sam the white shorts and a flowered
     shirt.  They sip drinks.  Their eyes meet.  Their fingers touch.

     VIDEOTAPE - RAY

                                  RAY
                  I told her I was coming with her.  She
                  nodded, like she understood.  We stood
                  up together.

                                  HUNTER (O.S.)
                  You didn't cuff her?

                                  RAY
                  She looked shaky, but lucid.  I thought,
                  I would just go with her, stand at the
                  door...
                         (shaking his head)
                  I think I looked away.  A split second.
                  Then, bingo.  Just like that.  She puts
                  a knee into my groin.
                         (beat)
                  There was this coffee table between us
                  and the wall.  She got one foot on that
                  thing and launched herself at the gun
                  case.  Thing had a glass door.  I could
                  hear it breaking.
                         (beat)
                  I didn't go down, but she slowed me up,
                  just enough.  Before I could get to her,
                  she'd turned on me with this small
                  caliber handgun.  I yelled at her to put
                  it down.  She got off a shot.  I took it
                  in the shoulder.  I... I had no choice.
                  I returned fire.  Two rounds, I think.
                  In the chest.

     INT. POLICE ROOM - SAME

     A moment of silence, save for the BUZZING of the MACHINE.  A
     number of plainclothes police, Hunter and Gloria among them,
     watch the tape.

                                   RAY
                  I went there to protect her...

     He hangs his head, then looks up, his eyes focusing.

                                   RAY (CONT'D)
                  The teeth, were they...

                                   HUNTER (0.S.)
                  Suzie Toller's.  And that's the only
                  thing saving your sorry ass.

     EXT. BOAT HARBOR (CARIBBEAN ISLAND) - DAY

     Brilliant sun on turquoise water.  A few boats anchored in a
     lagoon.  A quiet place.

     Heading out -- a forty-foot sloop, Sam at the helm.

     INT. HEARING ROOM - DAY

     Gloria, Baxter, a tearful Sandra, sit in seats, watch as --

     Ray stands before a panel, A SUIT, A CHIEF in uniform, Hunter.

     Ray wears a suit, his hair neatly trimmed.  His arm is no longer
     in a sling, but one of his hands is still bandaged.

                                  CHIEF
                  Detective Duquette; our investigation
                  concludes that this was a good shooting.
                  But that's irrelevant.  You were not
                  assigned to this case -- whatever you
                  imagined this case to be.  And now two
                  young women are dead.  You are
                  terminated with forfeiture of pension
                  and benefits.

     Ray looks at the floor.

     Hunter coughs.  His hands rest on a file -- we SEE the video
     cassette inside -- labeled "TOLLER/VAN RYAN -- CONFIDENTIAL."

                                  HUNTER
                  Suzie Toller's teeth and blood were
                  found near the area known as Stoner
                  Rocks.  Suzie's blood was found in the
                  Van Ryan Range Rover.  This, in
                  conjunction with evidence obtained by
                  Detectives Duquette and Perez has led
                  this office to the conclusion that Susan
                  Marie Toller was murdered by Kelly
                  Lanier Van Ryan...

     Sandra chokes back a sob.  She gets to her feet, to be led from
     the room by Tom Baxter.

     Gloria Perez watches, a sad look in her eye, then turns to look
     at Ray.  His back is to her -- the broad shoulders, expensive
     suit.  His hands are clasped behind his back.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. BLUE BAY CEMETERY - KELLY'S FUNERAL - DAY

     Gloria stands among a considerable number of mourners.  She is
     just back from Sandra and Tom Baxter, who, in turn, are just back
     from the open grave.

     As Gloria watches, Sandra looks off to the side, where something
     catches her eye.  Gloria sees her start, then follows her gaze.

     ANGLE ON CEMETERY - GLORIA'S POV

     On a rise some fifty yards from the Van Ryan plot, two people
     stand near an old oak -- Ruby and Walter.

     When Gloria looks back at Sandra, it seems to her as if the woman
     has slumped against Tom Baxter, who now stares at the two people
     on the rise as if, by doing so with sufficient intensity, he
     might make them disappear.

     Gloria turns to the grave site, her eye lingers on the open
     grave, then moves to the huge marker which dominates the Van Ryan
     family plot and, in fact, the entire scene.

     ANGLE CN MARKER

     The angel Gabriel, trumpet in hand, carved in relief upon a huge
     obelisk of black marble.  Beneath the angel is a carved scroll
     and upon it the words:

     "I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE," and below that:  "WILLIAM
     TECUMSEH VAN RYAN.  MAY HE REST IN PEACE."

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. A BEACH - NIGHT

     Sam Lombardo walks along a moonlit lagoon, headed toward a lone
     bungalow.

     The bungalow is simple, picturesque -- whitewashed walls, a
     thatched roof.  A patio opens onto the beach.

     EXT. PATIO - SAME

     As Sam steps in off the sand, he sees something and stops short.

     Wet spots lead toward the bungalow.

     Sam listens.  Everything is quiet.

     INT. BUNGALOW - SAME

     Sam ENTERS in a room lit only by the blue light of a large
     aquarium.  He listens once more, hears it -- RUNNING WATER.

     He moves down a short hallway, observes the light which spills
     from beneath a bedroom door.  He pushes it open, goes inside.

     INT. BEDROOM - SAME

     He CROSSES the room.

     The bathroom door is ajar, the room leaking steam.

     INT. BATHROOM - SAME

     Sam steps inside, looks at the shower stall -- an indistinct
     shape moves there in the steam.

     San watches, then jerks open the shower door.  The steam
     clears -- REVEALING a tall, athletic body, and now the face --

     Ray Duquette, grinning at Sam out of the swirling steam.

                                  RAY
                  Buy you a drink?

     San takes a step back.

                                  SAM
                  Jesus.  I wasn't expecting you 'til
                  tomorrow.

     Ray turns off the water, steps out of the stall, wrapping himself
     in a towel.  There's a fresh, raised scar across one shoulder and
     Ray winces a little as he tucks the towel about his waist.  He
     looks at himself in the mirror, touching the scar.

                                  RAY
                  Nice girlfriend you had there.

     Sam just looks at him.

                                  SAM
                  Yeah, well, you fixed that.
                         (beat)
                  What the hell happened, anyway?

                                  RAY
                  The bitch shot me, is what happened.

     Sam shakes his head, walks back into the bedroom.  Ray follows.

                                  RAY (CCNT'D)
                  Hey, what did you want me to do, die?

                                  SAM
                  Well, shit, you're the cop, they don't
                  teach you to disarm people, shoot them
                  in the leg or something?  You weren't
                  supposed to kill her for Christ's sake.

     Now Ray just looks at Sam, his eyes narrowing.

                                  RAY
                  Did you become squeamish about these
                  things before or after you bludgeoned
                  little Suzie Toller to death with a wine
                  bottle?
                         (off Sam's silence)
                  Jesus, man.
                  It couldn't have worked out better.
                  They're convinced Kelly whacked Suzie.
                  I can't talk 'em out of it.
                         (beat)
                  We should be celebrating.  This thing
                  worked out just like you said, only
                  better.

                                  SAM
                  Kelly was supposed to be framed, not
                  killed.
                         (beat)
                  What I'm telling you is, I don't like
                  surprises.

     Ray walks to a dresser where a bottle of champagne sits in a
     bucket of ice.  He opens the bottle, fills two glasses.  He hands
     one of the glasses to Sam.

                                  RAY
                  Every cloud has a silver lining,
                  partner.  Here's to no loose ends.

     He raises his glass in a toast.

     Sam looks at it, then raises his glass as well.  Ray smiles.  Sam
     doesn't.

                                  SAM
                  Here's to no more surprises.

     Ray shrugs.  The two men's eyes meet.  They touch glasses and
     drink.

     EXT. SMALL BOAT HARBOR (ISLAND) - DAY

     Sam and Ray work on the deck of Sam's sloop, stowing gear,
     loading supplies.

     The boat's mast shines in the sunlight before a brilliant sky.
     Palms sway.  The men work in silence.

     EXT. SMILIN' JACK'S FISH CAMP - DAY

     Gloria drives up in the white Taurus.  She parks before the
     ramshackle old building and the gator pen.

     Walter is in the pen.  Ruby stands just outside of it.  She looks
     toward the road as Gloria gets out, then back to the pen.

     Gloria comes down the bank to stand beside Ruby.  She's just in
     time to see the huge old reptile raise itself, hissing, on its
     front legs, jaws sprung wide.  The women watch as Walter sticks
     his arm into the gator's mouth.

                                  RUBY
                  Gator can't see what's in front of it
                  for shit.  They see out the sides.
                         (beat)
                  That one don't even know Walter's arm's
                  in his mouth.

                  What if something distracts it and it
                  snaps anyway?

                                  RUBY
                  Then I guess Walter can kiss that arm of
                  his goodbye.
                         (loud enough for Walter
                          to hear)
                  He don't use it for no good deeds
                  anyway.

     Walter looks at the ladies, picks up the stick and sweeps it
     between the gaping jaws, which snap in its wake.

                                  RUBY (CONT'D)
                  You come all the way out here to watch
                  Walter?

                                  GLORIA
                  I was wondering if I could ask you a few
                  questions.

                                  RUBY
                  About Suzie?

                                  GLORIA
                  Actually, I was wondering if I might ask
                  you about Ray Duquette.

                                  RUBY
                         (a long beat)
                  He used to come around here.  He had a
                  thing going with one of the girls over
                  at the Glades.

     Ruby nods toward the motel, a bitter smile on her face.

                                  RUBY (CONT'D)
                  Got sort of hung up on her, from what
                  hear.

                                  GLORIA
                  She still work there?

                                  RUBY
                  No.  Not after that night.
                         (a long beat)
                  I don't know what happened.  Maybe he
                  caught her with some john...
                  All I know is, the next morning the girl
                  was gone and there was a dead boy...
                  Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live
                  down the road there in a wrecked car.
                  Him and Suzie were at the Glades that
                  night.
                         (beat)
                  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie
                  busted and sent her away.  That's what
                  there is to say about Ray Duquette.

                                  GLORIA
                  Was there ever any kind of
                  investigation...

     Ruby cuts her off with a short laugh.

                                  RUBY
                  Duquette always claimed the kid was
                  dusted, came after him with a knife.
                  But it was Jack's Fish Camp... This
                  could be the moon for all most people
                  care.
                         (a long beat)
                  Wasn't supposed to be like that though.
                  This place was supposed to be something
                  once.  There were going to be roads and
                  houses.  There was going to be a town.
                  They were going to call it Salt Creek.

     EXT. OCEAN - DAY

     From the surface of the sea -- the emerald island in the
     distance.  The bow of the sloop comes INTO FRAME.

     On board -- Sam stands in the cockpit, at the helm.  Ray lounges
     on the deck.  The boat sails easily before the wind.

                                  SAM
                  Ray... you see that winch by your head?
                  Take a couple of turns on it for me,
                  she's luffing.

     Ray cranes his neck to look at the winch.

                                  RAY
                  You mean this thing?

                                  SAM
                  Yes, we call it a winch.
                         (pointing at pieces of
                          the rigging)
                  And these are shrouds, and these are
                  stays.

                                  RAY
                  I thought this was supposed to be a
                  vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big
                  power boat?

                                  SAM
                  Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of
                  you yet.

                                  RAY
                  Yeah, or get me drowned.

     Ray kneels.  He begins to tighten the winch.

     Sam watches him for a moment, then reaches around behind his back
     to unhook the short line which holds the boom.

     The mainsail catches wind, swinging the boom in a wide arc,
     directly at Ray.

     Ray looks up, sees it coming just in time to catch it on his arm.

     The blow is enough to send him sprawling through the lifelines,
     where he just manages to grab one of the nylon cords.

     Sam ducks as the boon continues to swing erratically above the
     deck, watching as Ray hauls himself on board.

     The boat no longer driven by the wind, bobs up and down on a
     small ground swell.

     The two men face each other.

                                  SAM
                  Jesus, man... You okay?

                                  RAY
                  That how you planned it?  You take cut
                  Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then
                  dump me in the ocean...

                                  SAM
                  Come off it, man... It was an accident.

     Ray nods, then reaches down, pulls off the winch handle and
     starts with it toward Sam.

     Sam looks around.  He jerks open a storage compartment.  A
     diver's weight belt tumbles out.  Sam grabs it, swings it over
     his head in circles, letting the weight pick up momentum,
     preparing to throw.

     Ray crouches, still brandishing the winch handle.  The boom
     sweeps the deck.

     Sam throws the belt.

     Ray grabs a shroud, dances out of the way, then steadies himself,
     a mean grin spreading across his face.

     There's no tine for Sam to look for anything else.

     Ray moves quickly across the deck -- a menacing sight -- tall,
     well-muscled, the handle gleaming in his hand.

     Sam pulls himself out of the cockpit.  Ray jumps in.  But that's
     as far as he gets.

     WHOOSH -- A spear pierces Ray's thigh.  He screams, goes down,
     the handle skittering across the deck.

     Ray follows it with his eyes, reaching out, then freezing as he
     sees something else.  He draws in his hand as if bitten.

                                  RAY
                  You... You're...

     He scuttles backward, pulling himself onto the deck, clutching at
     his leg which squirts blood as if an artery has been severed.
     But his eyes never leave the hatchway leading belowdecks.

                                  RAY (CONT'D)
                  You're dead... for godsake...

     The boat heels over.  The spear in Ray's thigh bangs against the
     edge of the cockpit.  He grimaces in pain as...

     Suzie Toller steps up from belowdecks.  She's wearing a bikini
     and showing a nice tan.  She's carrying Sam's new spear gun, a
     fresh spear at the ready.

                                  SUZIE
                  Rumors of my demise have been greatly
                  exaggerated.
                         (to Sam)
                  Nice move.  Good thing I was here to
                  save your incompetent ass.

     Sam secures the boom.  Ray stares at Suzie, his face twisted with
     some combination of pain, rage and fear.

                                  RAY
                  You... I should've killed you myself.
                  should never have left it up to him...

                                  SUZIE
                  Shoulda, coulda, woulda...
                         (to Sam)
                  Get him in the water.

     San starts for Ray.

                                  RAY
                  Sam, for Christ's sake...

     Sam's feet slide in the bloody smear.  He stops.

     Ray clings to a safety line.

                                  SAM
                  I can't.

     WHOOSH -- A second spear penetrates Ray's shoulder.  He loses his
     grip.  The boat heels over, dumping Ray into the water.

     Suzie puts down her spear gun.  She goes to a storage locker,
     takes out a bait bucket.  She steps up on the deck.

     Ray is floating not far from the boat, the water going red around
     him.  He calls out...

                                  RAY
                  Sam, for godsake.

                                  SUZIE
                  Hey, Ray.  Guess whose name is on the
                  numbered bank account besides yours and
                  Sam's?

     She raises the bucket, heaves bloody chum into the water.

                                  SUZIE (CONT'D)
                  I like these joint survivorship
                  accounts.  Something unfortunate happens
                  to one of the signatories, the others
                  don't have to worry.  Are you worrying,
                  Ray?

     She heaves more chum -- a big red slurp across Ray's face.

     Ray gasps, goes under, thrashing around in the red slick.

                                  SUZIE (CONT'D)
                  Men, use 'em abuse 'em lose 'em.

     INSERT - SHARKS

     from underwater, in a frenzy, rip a human body into a bloody
     cloud.

     EXT. SAILBOAT - LATER

     Suzie cones up from below with a champagne bottle and glasses,
     already filled.

                                  SUZIE
                  Feeling better?

     Sam gazes out to sea.

                                  SAM
                  That was about as grim as it gets.

                                  SUZIE
                  The guy was history when he killed
                  Kelly.  You knew that.

                                  SAM
                  But then you knew what he was like all
                  along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a
                  thing you had counted on...

                                  SUZIE
                  But then it is better this way, don't
                  you think?  No loose ends.

     Sam just looks at her.

                                  SUZIE (CONT'D)
                  What?

                                  SAM
                  That was the same thing Ray said.

     Suzie smiles -- showing the big gap where her two front teeth
     used to be.

                                  SUZIE
                  Poor Ray.
                         (a beat)
                  Come on Sam, we did it.  We put the
                  screws to the Van Ryans.  We won.

     She hands a glass to Sam, takes the other.  He puts it to his
     lips, suddenly hesitates, thinks, sniffs the glass.

     A moment.  Suzie shakes her head.

                                  SUZIE (CONT'D)
                  Talk about paranoid.  Now are you gonna
                  teach me to sail this big old boat or
                  not?

     Sam downs his drink.

                                  SAM
                  Okay.  Grab that winch there.

     Suzie gives him a pouty look.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                  What's wrong?

                                  SUZIE
                  Fuck the winch.  I wanna drive.

     Sam sighs.

                                  SAM
                  Okay.  Come here and take the helm.
                  I'll get the winch.

     Suzie gives him her best, gap-toothed smile, then comes forward
     to take the gleaming chrome wheel, as Sam scrambles up on deck,
     kneeling where Ray had kneeled before him to set the jib.

     Suzie watches -- a long beat, then, slowly reaches behind her,
     unhooking the line which holds the boom...

     ANGLE ON BOOM

     sweeping the deck -- coming right at us, blotting out the sky.

     EXT. SMILING JACK'S - SUZIE'S ROOM - DAY

     Gloria sits on Suzie's bed, books spread out around her.  Ruby
     stands beside her.

                                  RUBY
                  You asked if Suzie knew about the Salt
                  Creek land deal?  Girl read every book
                  she could find on it, the Van Ryans too.

     Ruby takes a photo album from among the books, opens it, tosses a
     photograph on the bed.  It is one we have seen before.

     ANGLE ON PHOTO

     A stately old gentleman in a three-piece suit.  White hair, a
     white handlebar mustache.  A derby on his knee, a walking stick
     at his side.  He stares out at the world from a high-backed
     wicker chair, flanked by potted palms and two small terriers.

     Across the bottom of the picture is the name -- "WILLIAM TECUMSEH
     VAN RYAN."  And beside that, in another hand -- "Dear old Dad."

                                  RUBY
                  Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy
                  the people who invested here.  He got to
                  be old, he and his rich cronies would
                  come down here, hunt and whore, act like
                  assholes.  One trip he showed up with
                  this young girl he'd picked up
                  somewhere, gotten her pregnant then
                  dumped her in the swamp.
                         (indicating the photo)
                  That came with her.

                  She had it, before she drank herself to
                  death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...

                  Raised her like she was, but no,
                  Walter's my only child.
                         (beat)
                  He was a good boy, till the army took

     Gloria looks once more at the old photograph.

                                  GLORIA
                  So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half-
                  sisters.

                                  RUBY
                  And the other girl, Kelly.  Suzie's
                  niece.

     Gloria stands, a little weary.  Ruby walks her from the room.

                                  GLORIA
                  Thank you for talking to me, Ruby.  I am
                  sorry about Suzie, she...

     They have gotten to the main room and Gloria stops short,
     noticing for the first time that the beat-up old black-and-white
     TV has been replaced by a high-tech, giant-screen television.

                                  RUBY
                  You okay?

                                  GLORIA
                  I'm fine.  Nice TV.

     The old lady nods, walks her outside.

     EXT. SMILIN' JACK'S FISH CAMP - DAY

     The dusty road, the little dock, the gator pen.

                                  RUBY
                  There's an old saying from the
                  Everglades -- virtue may be missed but
                  sin can't hide.
                         (a long beat)
                  Folks pay in the end.

     Gloria nods.  She is distracted by a movement in the gator pen.

     CLOSE ON PEN

     For a moment there is nothing more than a few ripples across the
     surface of the pond which lies inside the pen, then, slowly, the
     GATOR'S EYES -- cold, reptilian, unblinking, rising up to gaze
     across the oily waters.

     INT. GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT

     Kelly is frantically trying to unlock the gun case as Ray comes
     through the French doors.  She can't get it done.  He's there in
     an instant.

     She screams, backs away, then watches as Ray stops, wraps a hanky
     around his hand and breaks the glass.

     He takes out a small caliber handgun, checks the clip, aims the
     gun at his own shoulder and fires.

     EXT. EVERGLADES - DAY

     A Jeep and a truck parked in the mud.  Sam and Ray meet under
     heavy, moss-draped cypress.  Sam hands Ray a plastic bag -- the
     teeth.

                                  SAM
                  You know the place I'm talking about --

     behind the big rocks.  He's got vise-grip pliers jammed in her
     mouth.  Suzie moans, for real.  He loosens his grip.

                                  SUZIE
                  You've got the pressure too tight.
                  You'll crush the fucking evidence.

     Sam takes a breath, prepares to try again.  Suzie pops a couple
     of pills with gulps of wine.  Sam goes to it once more.

     INT. SAM'S HOUSE - DAY

     Kelly and Sam on the floor, naked.  He's on her from the rear.
     It's getting wild.  He suddenly stops, rolls to the floor.

                                  SAM
                  We gotta stop.  I'm gonna come.

     Kelly laughs, straddles him.

                                  KELLY
                  That never seemed to worry you at the
                  Glades.

                                  SAM
                  That's not your line.

                                  KELLY
                  Say you love me.

                         (a beat)
                  I love you.  Now give me the line.

                                  KELLY
                         (a whiny voice)

     Suzie's VW is parked across the street, in the shadows of tall
     trees.  She and Sam sit inside, watching as...

     Ray Duquette EXITS a bungalow, a sport coat over his arm.  He
     heads for Jim's Recovery Room.  In another moment, a young hooker
     in a leather miniskirt walks out of the same bungalow.

                                  SUZIE
                  Seems to like some of the same places
                  you do.  Funny you never met.

                                  SAM
                  Yeah, real funny.  You're wrong about
                  this, I could get busted on the spot.

                                  SUZIE
                  Trust me, the guy's dirty.  He'll like
                  it.  Especially the part about offing
                  me.
                         (beat)
                  Now get out of here.  Go make yourself a
                  new friend.

     INT. JIM'S RECOVERY ROOM - NIGHT

     Ray is at the bar.  Sam sits down next to him.  A moment of
     silence, the twang of a country JUKE BOX -- then...

                  You like bein' a caddy for rich kids'
                  problems?

     Sam just looks at her.

                                  SUZIE (CONT'D)
                  I've seen you out there in your old air
                  boat, thinking about what might have
                  been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you
                  out of it.

                  Well, I'd need the famous Lombardo
                  charm, not that you'd have to do
                  anything you haven't done already.

     She takes an envelope from her notebook, tosses it in front of
     Sam.  Pictures slide onto his desk -- Sam and Kelly -- in various
     poses of coked-out debauchery at the Glades Motel.

                  that little straw Kelly's got up her
                  nose, or that vibrator you've got up her
                  ass.  What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?

     Sam lounges in a booth.  He looks hot, bored.  He stirs a drink.
     Kelly walks in out of the light.  She is looking a little strung
     out, a big straw bag slung over one shoulder, but oh, so sexy in
     skimpy cutoffs and cowboy boots -- long legs flashing as she
     nears Sam's booth.  Sam looks up, as...

                  I have toys.

     She takes out a snail bag of white powder, taps out a line on the
     table top.

     Sam looks at it.  He looks at Kelly.  He's had a few drinks.

                                  SAM

               TITLE SEQUENCE

               The faces of several young children are presented in CLOSEUP, 
               as they walk TOWARD US across a ploughed field. On the SOUND 
               TRACK, the haunting SOUNDS OF A GREGORIAN FUNERAL CHANT. The 
               CAMERA PANS UP to the faces of older brothers and sisters, 
               then to parents and grandparents. These are not familiar 
               faces, but faces from another age, strong and open. All are 
               dressed in the distinctive clothing of the Amish.

               EXT. COUNTRY LANE  DAY

               Through the last traces of early morning mist another group 
               of black-clad figures make their way down a lane.

               EXT. COUNTRY LANE  DAY

               An Amish buggy, black and highwheeled, stark against the 
               landscape, appears, a spirited chestnut in the traces.

               Framed in the glass window of the narrow buggy is the stern 
               figure of an Amish man in black topcoat and flatbrimmed hat, 
               his bonneted wife in muted colors, the face of a boy, attired 
               like his father, peering out.

               The horse's breath smokes on the frosty air, the buggy CREAKS 
               on its springs, and there's the rhythmic CLIP-CLOP OF HOOVES 
               on the pavement.

               ANOTHER LANE

               Two Amish buggies reach a crossroads, join a procession of 
               three others. They disappear as the lane wends through a 
               leafless thicket of hickory.

               VALLEY

               A BIG SHOT... now the procession numbers almost a dozen 
               buggies... it is headed toward a distant farmhouse.

               BARNYARD

               Where literally dozens of carriages are parked. The horses 
               have been taken from the traces, removed to the shelter of 
               the barn.

               EXT. LAPP FARMHOUSE  FRONT PORCH

               As the black clad mourners begin to move into the house (women 
               and children presumably first).

               INT. LAPP FARMHOUSE

               The coffin has the upper half open. We see that the corpse 
               has been dressed in white linen, a piece of white linen 
               partially covering the bearded face.

               END TITLE SEQUENCE

               INT. LAPP FARMHOUSE

               Partitions have been removed, making the central rooms of 
               the farmhouse a spacious hall. The place is packed, a hundred-
               fifty or more Amish, all sitting in absolute silence on rows 
               of wooden benches. A wooden coffin rests on a bench in the 
               f.g., and near it the close relatives of the deceased occupy 
               a special Place.

               RACHEL LAPP

               A young woman of perhaps twenty-seven. Her face is pale and 
               drawn.

               In happier circumstances, although there haven't been too 
               many of late in Rachel's life, we would see a robust, sensual 
               woman of full figure, spirit and intelligence.

               Eight-year-old SAMUEL LAPP flits next to his mother; he would 
               appear stunned, possibly not entirely comprehending events.

               And the patriarch, ELI LAPP; his stubborn, weathered  yet 
               not unkind  features grief-stricken.

               THE MOURNERS

               Their faces...

               CLOCK

               As it begins to CHIME nine a.m.

               FAVORING PREACHER

               As he removes his hat. As one, the men in the congregation 
               remove their hats also.

               Then the preacher begins to speak in a formal German dialect:

               SUBTITLES OVER.

                                     PREACHER
                         ...a brother has been called home. 
                         God has spoken through the death of 
                         our neighbor, Jacob Lapp...

               THE FAMILY

               Where Rachel, Samuel and Eli are SITTING - SOUNDS of emotion 
               and grief not quite suppressed are heard throughout as:

                                     PREACHER
                         ...husband of Rachel, father to 
                         Samuel, son of Eli.
                              (and)
                         His chair is empty, his bed is empty, 
                         his voice will be heard no more. He 
                         was needed in our presence, but God 
                         needs such men, too. That one should 
                         be taken so suddenly. Treat sorrow. 
                         Still, we would not wish him back. 
                         Rather we should prepare ourselves 
                         to follow him.

               TIGHTENING to the Lapps, and...

               EXT. CEMETERY

               The mourners have gathered about the grave, standing in 
               silence as four pallbearers are lowering the coffin into the 
               pit. The many buggies are aligned in the b.g.

               As the pallbearers begin to shovel soil and gravel into the 
               grave, the Preacher begins to read a hymn in German... a 
               slow atonal litany which seems to hang forever on the frosty 
               air.

               RACHEL

               TIGHTENING to her as the hymn continues...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAPP FARMHOUSE

               Where the Amish have gathered for the traditional post 
               funeral, midday meals.

               Long tables are laden with customary Amishfare... crocks of 
               soup, hams, fowl, fried boiled eggs and pickled beets, 
               preserves and an infinite variety of pies and pastries.

               RACHEL

               DANIEL HOCHSTETLER

               A brawny-armed, ruggedly-handsome, raffish looking Amishman. 
               There is something atypical about his face a slightly sardonic 
               set of mouth, a bold eye, a prominent set of jaw. Not exactly 
               what old Jacob Ammann had in mind, maybe, but a well set-up 
               man nonetheless, and at ease among men. He's among a group 
               of men including old STOLTZFUS, the local healer, FISHER, 
               BIEILER and Bieiler's stout young son, Tom.

                         Lapp was a good farmer. None better.

                         Hochstetler, wasn't it your father 
                         sold him that horse with a ruptured 
                         testicle?

                                     TOM
                              (grins)
                         Told him it was a bee sting made him 
                         limp that way.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                              (amused)
                         That horse had one good ball. That's 
                         all it takes.

               The others chuckle. But Hochstetler's attention is still on 
               Rachel.

               RACHEL

               As Hochstetler looms on the horizon, plants himself like a 
               tree in front of her.

               At ease as he was with the men, he's a bit awkward at this. 
               All the women, very much aware of Hochstetler's availability, 
               tune in as Rachel looks up.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         I was sorry to hear about Jacob. Let 
                         us hope he walks close with God.

                                     RACHEL
                         I'm sure he does, Daniel.

               FIELDS, LAPP FARM  DAY

               It is some time after the funeral and the Lapp family is 
               hard at work breaking ground for the spring ploughing. The 
               death of Jacob has increased the work load on all three  
               Samuel maneuvers a four-mule team while Rachel and old Eli 
               work nearby, further breaking up the earth. Rachel looks up 
               from the back-breaking labor as several figures approach  
               it's Daniel Hochstetler and two of his brothers. Without a 
               word they fall in beside Eli and Rachel and take up various 
               tasks associated with the work in hand.

               Daniel works close beside Rachel.

               EXT. COUNTRY ROADS, LANCASTER COUNTY  DAY

               A few BRIEF SHOTS of a lone buggy containing the Lapp family 
               take us from the 18th century into the 20th century the 
               reassuring RATTLE OF THE CARRIAGE WHEELS on quiet backroad, 
               to the ROAR OF TRAFFIC as the buggy waits patiently for a 
               chance to cross a busy interstate highway.

               EXT. HIGHWAY, LANCASTER COUNTY  DAY

               A huge tractor trailer rig hovers over the frail buggy as it 
               trots down the interstate. The camera cranes up to reveal a 
               procession of vehicles behind the truck for a chance to 
               overtake it.

               EXT. PLATFORM, LANCASTER STATION  DAY

               Daniel Hochstetler moves through the crowd on the plat-form, 
               Rachel turns surprised, as he approaches, a faint color coming 
               to her cheek.

                                     RACHEL
                         Daniel?

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         I... I was at the feed store. And I 
                         saw your horse, so...

               There is an embarrassment between them broken by the arrival 
               of the train.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         You will come back soon?

               Samuel can barely contain his excitement as he drags at his 
               mother's hand.

                                     SAMUEL
                         Quickly, Mother Quickly!

               Rachel embraces Eli.

                                     ELI
                         You be careful out among them English.

               She turns to Hochstetler.

                                     RACHEL
                         I need time, Daniel.

               EXT. CARPARK, LANCASTER STATION  DAY

               Daniel Hochstetler leaps into the driving seat of his open 
               wagon and with a flick of the reins and a whoop sets his 
               horse off at a fast trot.

               EXT. TRAIN  DAY

               The ENGINE gives a WARNING BLAST before creeping slowly 
               forward.

               INT. TRAIN (MOVING)

               As Samuel spots something out of the window that causes him 
               to light up.

                                     SAMUEL
                         Look, Mama...!

               HIS POV THROUGH WINDOW

               A road runs parallel to the train track, and Hochstetler in 
               his wagon urges his horse almost to the gallop as he attempts 
               to keep pace with the train.

               BACK TO SCENE

               As Rachel smiles.

                                     RACHEL
                         I see, darling.

               And Samuel cranes to look back, waving, for as long as he 
               can.

               EXT. LANCASTER COUNTRYSIDE  DAY

               The train moves across a broad panorama of fields, dotted 
               with dolls'-house-sized farms and the tiny figures of Amish 
               farmers working their horse-drawn equipment.

               SERIES OF CUTS

               As the train continues its eastward journey... Samuel stares 
               raptly out of the window at the changing patterns of the 
               countryside. He points in wonder at a brightly colored hot 
               air balloon as it drifts slowly over timbered hills... he 
               looks unsure as the pattern of field and wood gives way to 
               suburbs, bustling shopping centers, restaurants, car lots 
               and fast food outlets.

               EXT. PHILADELPHIA SLUMS

               As the train travels past dilapidated row houses, streets 
               choked with cars and the gutters with filth.

               INT. TRAIN (MOVING)

               Now Samuel is staring out the window with some confusion, 
               almost apprehension:

                                     SAMUEL
                         Is this where we're going?

                                     RACHEL
                         Of course not. We're going to 
                         Baltimore. It's much nicer in 
                         Baltimore.

               And Rachel draws her son closer, turning her back on the 
               window.

               INT. 30TH ST. STATION, PHILADELPHIA  DAY

               Rachel is in a line at one of the counters. The plain dress 
               of the two Amish  particularly Samuel's black coat and hat 
                are drawing curious stares.

               SAMUEL

               He's uncomfortably aware of the shy looks and giggles of a 
               little girl about his own age, standing in line with her 
               parents at the next counter. He edges away from his mother...

               ANGLE

               As Samuel comes upon a figure garbed in a long black frock 
               coat and flat-brimmed hat... the man's back is turned, could, 
               from appearances, be an Amishman.

               Samuel stares... A beat, the man turns to face Samuel and we 
               discover that he is a Hasidic Jew.

               SAMUEL

               As he reacts.

               BACK TO TICKET COUNTER

               As Rachel's turn arrives. The TICKET SELLER glances up and 
               she shows him her ticket.

                                     RACHEL
                         We have a ticket to Baltimore. Where 
                         is that train, please?

                                     TICKET SELLER
                         Delayed three hours. You'll hear an 
                         announcement when it's time to board.

               He starts to go without his hat, but Rachel collars him and 
               puts it on his head.

               ANGLE IN MEN'S ROOM

               As Samuel enters.

               It's a long row of sinks, urinals, and stalls... Samuel stops 
               before one of the urinals  a long, trough-like affair with 
               water drizzling down the rear porcelain panel.

               It's set a little high for Samuel, and it is making GLUGGING 
               FLUSHING NOISES that are, at least, intimidating. Samuel 
               stares for a moment, then turns, looks toward the stalls, 
               stoops to see which are empty.

               HIS POV  TOILETS

               Beneath the row of doors we can see no feet visible. Samuel 
               is alone in the restroom.

               BACK TO SCENE

               As Samuel proceeds along the row of door, finally selects a 
               stall near the end. He enters. As he does so, a heavily 
               bearded youth in a dirty sweatshirt enters. With some urgency, 
               he removes small notebook from his pocket and places it behind 
               a paper towel dispenser. Suddenly he glances up.

               Two other men have entered the men's room; one is a large 
               BLACK MAN in a three-piece suit under an expensive, overcoat. 
               His PARTNER is a Caucasian in designer jeans, half boots and 
               a short leather jacket.

               They advance on the young man with unmistakable menace.

               The young man whirls in terror; his two assailants lunge for 
               him... a savage, wordless struggle ensues in the close 
               confines of the lavatory.

               ANGLE IN SAMUEL'S STALL

               As the struggling men bounce off the door of his stall... he 
               can see their feet under the edge of the door.

               BACK TO FIGHT

               As the struggle builds to a climax... ends with the young 
               man stiffening with a grunt, his face draining of color.

               The two attackers step away, the blade in the black man's 
               hand bloodstained. His partner stares at what they've 
               accomplished with a stunned expression:

                                     PARTNER
                         Jesus...

               The young man's hand comes away from his belly covered with 
               blood.

               He stares at it, staggers toward the sinks. Finally his 
               bloodied hand reaches to smear at his face in the mirror. 
               Then he collapses to the floor.

               The black man motions for his partner to watch the door, 
               then quickly reaches up and removes the notebook from behind 
               the dispenser.

               ANGLE IN SAMUEL'S STALL

               As he edges open the stall door a crack. Over his shoulder 
               we can see the black man, his BACK TO US, rifling the 
               backpack. But beyond him, in the mirror on the far wall, we 
               catch sight of the black man's face.

               SAMUEL

               As he stares out the narrow crack. A beat, then he closes 
               the stall door.

               ANGLE IN STALL

               Samuel tries to make the latch work, but it's warped and 
               won't fall closed.

               BLACK MAN

               As he checks the notebook before placing it in his pocket. 
               His partner is covering the door, an automatic in his hand.

               The black man makes for the exit, then on second thought, 
               glances at the row of stalls.

               HIS POV  STALLS

               All quiet, but...

               BACK TO SCENE

               The black man whips out a .38 caliber revolver, and, starting 
               at the near end, starts pushing open the stall doors.

               ANGLE IN SAM'S STALL

               As the black man approaches, Samuel working desperately on 
               the latch. At the last minute he finally wedges it in.

               BLACK MAN

               He elbows Samuel's stall... the door won't open.

               ANGLE IN SAM'S STALL

               Fighting back panic, Samuel has retreated as far as he can.

               BLACK MAN

               As he gives the door a kick. It holds. He swears under his 
               breath.

               ANGLE IN SAM'S STALL

               In desperation, Samuel does the only thing he can think of... 
               he slips under the partition into the neighboring stall the 
               black man just checked out. But he loses his hat in the 
               process. His hand snakes back INTO FRAME to snatch it just 
               as the black man gives the door a ferocious kick that 
               splinters the lock and nearly takes it off its hinges. He's 
               framed there, the big muzzle of the .38 revolver looking 
               down our throats.

               ANGLE

               As his partner snaps from the doorway:

                                     PARTNER
                         Will you come on, for Christ's sakes!

               A beat, then the black man holsters his weapon, turns to 
               follow the partner out.

               BACK TO SAMUEL

               As we hear the SOUND OF THE TWO MEN EXITING the lavatory. A 
               long beat, then Samuel opens the stall door a crack.

               HIS POW THROUGH DOOR

               Samuel's own face reflected in the blood-smeared mirror... 
               then PANNING DOWN to the still figure of the young man lying 
               in the crimson pool of his own blood on the floor.

               BENCH WAITING ROOM  LOW ANGLE  NIGHT

               Samuel sits close to his mother, his face pale, his eyes 
               staring.

               Rachel holds his hand tightly in hers as the torsos of various 
               police and officials pass through foreground, occasionally 
               obscuring the lonely couple. There is considerable ECHOING 
               NOISE as commands and requests mingle with the CRACKLE OF 
               TWO-WAY RADIOS.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DOOR  MEN'S' ROOM

               The diffused shape of faces behind the frosted glass of the 
               Men's room door, which is pushed open to reveal, JOHN BOOK, 
               who comes striding through to be momentarily lost in the 
               crowd of police, reporters and others. He is about 40, with 
               a rangy, athletic body. Behind him comes CARTER, Book's black 
               partner  about five years younger than Book. Book is wearing 
               a suit, Carter is much more casually  almost disreputably  
               dressed.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BENCH

               Little Samuel watching Book, back to crowd of police, as 
               Book questions an old black CUSTODIAN.

                                     BOOK
                         You found the body?

                                     CUSTODIAN
                         Uh uh. Not me, daddy, I just reported 
                         it. It was the kid.

                                     BOOK
                         What kid?

                                     CUSTODIAN
                         How'n hell do I know what kid? The 
                         kid in the funny black threads.

               TIGHT SHOT  SAMUEL

               Worry-eyed, still staring straight ahead. Then his eyes move 
               suddenly to his left.

               BOOK'S LEGS  SAMUEL'S POV

               Coming in at full stride, then stopping.

               SAMUEL

               He doesn't raise his eyes... just looks at the legs. And, 
               slowly, the legs begin to bend at the knees. We see Book's 
               belt buckle, then his big pistol in its holster, then his 
               face. He stares at Samuel for a moment, then...

               As his face breaks into a big grin, and...

                                     BOOK
                         Hi, kid.

               RACHEL

               Immediately alarmed, intervening.

                         What do you want of my son?

               THE SCENE

               As Book takes out his wallet, displays his shield.

                                     BOOK
                         I'm a police officer. I'm going to 
                         have to talk to the boy. What's his 
                         name?

                                     RACHEL
                         Samuel. Samuel Lapp.
                              (then, quickly)
                         But what happened here is none of 
                         his affair. My sister is expecting 
                         me... our train is leaving soon.

                                     BOOK
                         There'll be another train.
                              (turns to Samuel)
                         The man who was killed tonight was a 
                         policeman, Sam. It's my job to find 
                         out who did it. I want you to tell 
                         me everything you saw when you went 
                         in there.

                                     SAMUEL
                              (stammers)
                         I saw him.

                                     BOOK
                         Who'd you see?

               Sam looks at his mother.

                                     BOOK
                         Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the 
                         floor?

                                     SAMUEL
                         No... I saw the man who killed him.

               Book stares at him in surprise, speaks over his shoulder to 
               Carter.

                                     BOOK
                         Anybody know about this?

                                     CARTER
                         I didn't even know about it.

                                     BOOK
                              (back to Sam)
                         Okay, Sam. Can you tell me what he 
                         looked like?

                                     SAMUEL
                              (groping, touching 
                              his clothes and 
                              pointing at Carter)
                         He was... like him.

                                     BOOK
                              (nods)
                         Black... I understand. What else,Sam?

               A beat, then Sam crosses quickly to Carter, Book's rather 
               slightly built partner:

                                     SAMUEL
                         Not Zwartich, like him 

               Book frowns, puzzled:

                                     BOOK
                         Try that one again, Sam 

               Samuel gives his mother a helpless look; exasperated, Rachel 
               intervenes with Book. She glances at Carter:

                                     RACHEL
                         May I talk to you?

               ANGLE

               As Rachel takes Book aside, and in a low voice:

                                     RACHEL
                         Zwartich. It's the way we say... 
                         dwarf.
                              (glances at Carter)
                         Not like him... very big.

               Book nods, starts to turn back to Sam. Just then a commotion 
               off screen catches his attention.

               BOOK'S POV  ONCOMING COPS

               It's Capt. TERRY DONAHUE, Chief of Homicide, striding past 
               the crowd of journalists and TV crews... brushing off 
               reporters' questions and snapping orders to the aides he's 
               got in tow:

               BACK TO SCENE

               AS DONAHUE COMES ON BOOK:

                                     DONAHUE
                              (to aides)
                         Close it all down... I want a man on 
                         every exit... I want the lab in here 
                         now!
                              (to Book)
                         And I want to talk to you, Captain.

               ANGLE

               As Book steps aside with Donahue... In the b.g. Rachel moves 
               protectively to Samuel's side.

                                     BOOK
                         All right, talk. 

                                     DONAHUE
                         This is homicide  not Internal 
                         Affairs! So why are you behaving 
                         like you own this case?

                                     BOOK
                         We were running Zenovitch... That's 
                         all I can tell you. But I want it, 
                         Terry.
                              (then)
                         I've got a call into Schaeffer.

               RACHEL / SAMUEL

               They can't help but watch the confrontation between Donahue 
               and Book... although they're keeping the volume down, it's 
               obviously intense and angry:

                                     SAMUEL
                              (alarmed)
                         Momma... are they angry with us.

                                     RACHEL
                              (reassuring, but hardly 
                              in her own mind)
                         No... No. It is just the English 
                         way.

               Donahue has lost the confrontation; he gives Book a smile:

                                     DONAHUE
                         You ought to think about coming back 
                         to Homicide, Johnny... Stick with 
                         Internal Affairs and you're not gonna 
                         have any friends left.

                              (smiles right back)
                         I'll buy a dog.

               EXT. 30TH ST. STATION  NIGHT

               Book emerges from the terminal, looks about him, then crosses 
               to a big Mercury Sedan which is parked nearby. Two men sit 
               in the front seat. Book crosses to the driver's side and 
               opens the door.

                                     BOOK
                         Go get a cup of coffee, Stan.

               The driver, a uniformed policeman, glances at the man beside 
               him who nods in agreement. He gets out and Book gets in behind 
               the wheel.

               INT. SEDAN

               Book sits next to SCHAEFFER, a surprisingly kindly looking 
               man of about fifty. Schaeffer is a Deputy Chief.

                                     SCHAEFFER

                         Oh, he's good.

                         Amish.

                                     BOOK
                         Yeah.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         What have you got?

                                     BOOK
                         Zenovitch was about to deliver a 
                         list of names tonight  street 
                         chemists... the guys processing this 
                         P2P into speed.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         So one of them got to him.

                                     BOOK
                         Maybe.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You know who?

                                     BOOK
                         Maybe.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You're still convinced there's a 
                         link to the department?

                                     BOOK
                         If there isn't I've just wasted the 
                         last six months.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         That's the problem. We need results. 
                         The press is driving us crazy over 
                         this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed 
                         capitol of the country'. You know 
                         the sort of thing. It's getting 
                         political. The Commissioner's getting 
                         very uneasy.

                         The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll 
                         make it, but Set Donahue and the 
                         Homicide Department off my back or 
                         they'll blow the whole thing.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         When word gets out that Zenovitch 
                         was a cop, all hell will break lose.

                         can give you. 24 hours on your own. 
                         After that the case and the witness 
                         go back to the Homicide Department.

               INT. BOOK'S CAR (MOVING) PHILADELPHIA  NIGHT

               Book drives around 13th Street, a ravaged corridor between 
               neon lit restaurants, bars, porno shops and darkened 
               storefronts.

               Carter sits beside him, Rachel and her son in the back seat 
               looking out at the assorted array of desperate characters 
               huddled in doorways or wandering aimlessly about. On the 
               POLICE RADIO a description of the cop killing is BROADCAST 
               EVERY FEW MINUTES.

                                     CARTER
                         I got there late, John.

                         didn't let anybody down. It happens 
                         

                              (grimly)
                         It won't happen again.

                                     RACHEL

                         You don't understand, we have nothing 
                         to do with your laws!

                         Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of

                                     RACHEL
                         It's not a joke.

               Book decides to try contrition:

                                     BOOK
                         You're right. It's not a joke. Listen, 
                         I know a little about the Amish. I 
                         know this has to be an ordeal for 
                         you; and I'm really sorry you an 
                         Samuel got involved.

               Samuel shoots a look at Book then mutters something to his 
               mother in German. She responds in the same language. Book 
               frowns.

                                     BOOK
                         What was that?

                                     RACHEL
                         He wants to know who you are. Your 
                         name. I told him we don't need to 
                         know anything about you.

               Book eyes Samuel:

                         Book. John Book

               EXT. 13TH ST. STATION  NIGHT

               Book's car stops, and from out of the shadows darts a wizened 
               little MAN. He looks about before crossing to the driver's 
               side window.

               INT. BOOK'S CAR  NIGHT

               Book lowers the window.

                                     BOOK
                         Sammy, where's Coalmine?

               The little man stares at the weird-looking couple in the 
               back seat.

                                     SAMMY
                         What you got there, the Salvation 
                         Army?

                         Try "Happy Valley".

               EXT. HAPPY VALLEY BAR, SOUTH STREET  NIGHT

               Book's car pulls up outside the bar and he and Carter get 
               out, and move swiftly inside.

               INT. HAPPY VALLEY  NIGHT

               Sixty black faces stare as the police enter. A hush falls on 
               the group. Book and Carter spot their man at the bar and 
               move up either side of him. They've moved carefully to this 
               point... no mistakes. From the back, the black man they've 
               approached certainly looks like he could be the man who did 
               the killing of Zenovitch. And, as Book and Carter make their 
               move...

               EXT. HAPPY VALLEY  NIGHT

               As Book and Carter explode through the door of the bar, 
               violently propelling Coalmine along with them. Now we see 
               Coalmine is not the killer.

               As Book and Carter escort Coalmine out of the bar a police 
               squad car pulls up, its headlights shining into Book's car. 
               An alarmed Rachel holds Samuel close as Book forces Coalmine's 
               face down next to the car window.

                                     BOOK
                         Put some light on him.

               A cop pulls out a flashlight, begins to play the beam over 
               Coalmine's face.

                                     BOOK
                              (continuing; to Samuel)
                         Look at him.

               Crazy as Rasputin on speed and booze, Coalmine glares at 
               Samuel inside the car:

               Samuel, white-faced, finally shakes his head in the negative.

               Coalmine tries to twist free of Book's grip. Book snaps, and 
               slams Coalmine's skull into the window edge, finally crushing 
               his face up against the front window. His face takes on a 
               grotesque shape against the glass. Carter restrains his 
               partner and Book cools down. Coalmine is led stumbling away 
               by the uniformed police. This sudden show of violence has 
               horrified and angered Rachel, and she glares at Book as he 
               gets back in the car.

                                     RACHEL
                         John Book, you listen to me! I will 
                         have no further part in this, nor 
                         will my son! As God stands between 
                         us!

               Book sighs, starts the engine and moves off.

               EXT. HOTEL  PHILADELPHIA  NIGHT

               Book pulls up outside a hotel entrance as a uniformed DOORMAN 
               moves to open the rear door.

               INT. CAR  NIGHT

               Rachel and Sam recoil as the Doorman opens the door. He is 
               puzzled by the sight of the reluctant guests.

                                     DOORMAN
                         Ma'am?

                         No! We do not stay in hotels.

               Book and Carter exchange a glance.

               EXT. / INT. FRONT DOOR, SUBURBAN HOUSE  PHILADELPHIA  
               NIGHT

               An attractive woman in her early thirties in robe and slippers 
               stares in disbelief as Rachel and Sam file into the house. 
               This is ELAINE, Book's sister. She stops Book as he tries to 
               follow Rachel inside.

                                     ELAINE
                         How could you do this to me tonight? 
                         I told you I had company

               As she glances in a doorway.

               HER POV  ELAINE'S KITCHEN

               It's a shambles, with dirty supper dishes piled sink, the 
               table littered with empty beer cans.

               BACK TO RACHEL

               As she hustles Samuel along.

               BOOK / ELAINE

               Book frowns:

                         Oh sure, Fred.

               Elaine looks like she's going to blow again, then decides 
               it's pointless.

                                     ELAINE
                         Who are these orphans, anyway?

               ANGLE IN GUEST ROOM

               Samuel is asleep in one twin bed in a tiny, cluttered room.

               Rachel, in a plain nightgown, is preparing to climb into the 
               other one.

               Off screen we hear a DOOR CLOSE, presumably Book leaving. A 
               beat, then Elaine opens the door and looks in.

                                     ELAINE
                         Everything okay?

                                     RACHEL
                         Yes, thank you very much.

                                     ELAINE
                              (a beat)
                         John said you're Amish.

                                     RACHEL
                         Yes.

                                     ELAINE
                              (blankly)
                         Oh.

               She nods and goes.

               Rachel crosses to Samuel, sits on the bed. Samuel looks up 
               at her bleakly.

                                     SAMUEL
                         I don't want to stay here.

                                     RACHEL
                         They are English. They don't 
                         understand.

                                     SAMUEL
                         I wish dawdie was with us.

                              (swallows)
                         I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.

               She puts her hand on his forehead, closes his eyes. she 
               frowns, and...

               EXT. DRIVE-IN FAST-FOOD JOINT  PHILADELPHIA  DAWN

               Carter exits the cafe carrying burgers, donuts and a couple 
               of beers. Book wakes from a brief nap as Carter gets into 
               the car.

               Book chews into his burger while Carter takes a doughnut. 
               Its clear they've worked through the night.

               EXT. ELAINE'S HOUSE  DAY

               Elaine's house is situated on the corner of a row of terraces, 
               which stretch into the distance on both sides of the street.

               INT. ELAINE'S HOUSE

               As Samuel comes out of the guest room in his night-shirt, 
               turns up the hall and opens the door to the bathroom.

               ANGLE

               But it's not the bathroom; it's Elaine's bedroom. She and 
               FRED are tangled in the sheets, furiously making love. Elaine 
               gasps, Fred manages to grunt.

                                     FRED
                         Wrong door, kid.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As Samuel quickly shuts the door. A straight-faced beat; 
               then, barely suppressing a giggle, he hurries on...

               ANGLE IN LIVING ROOM

               As Rachel appears in the living room entry. Samuel is sitting 
               on the floor with two boys of about his own age, watching 
               television.

               They're eating cold cereal out of a box.

               RACHEL'S POV  TV SCREEN

               Some artless Saturday morning cartoon.

               BACK TO RACHEL

               As she frowns, watching her son and the other two staring 
               hypnotically. And...

               ANGLE IN LIVING ROOM

               It's later in the morning now, as Elaine, a bit blearily, 
               appears in the entryway, stares in groggy disbelief.

               HER POV  KIDS

               Her oldest boy and Samuel are busily washing the windows 
               while her youngest is pushing a carpet sweeper. The TV is 
               off.

               BACK TO ELAINE

               As she stares.

               ANGLE IN KITCHEN

               Rachel is standing in the middle of the now immaculate kitchen 
               finishing a brisk mop of the floor. The coffee is perking. 
               Elaine appears.

                                     ELAINE
                              (mutters)
                         Jesus...

               Rachel turns cheerily.

                                     RACHEL
                         Good morning.

                                     ELAINE
                              (helplessly)
                         You didn't have to...

                                     RACHEL
                         I wanted to. you were kind to take 
                         us in last night.
                              (and)
                         Anyway, I needed something to do. I 
                         was so angry with your brother. He's 
                         so... agaanisish!

                                     ELAINE
                         Aganishish? Yeah, that sounds like 
                         John.

               She takes a seat at the table, still shaking her head.

                                     RACHEL
                         Just a minute. I'll pour you some 
                         coffee.

                                     ELAINE
                         You're not carrying a bullwhip... 
                         how'd you manage to put my kids to 
                         work?

                                     RACHEL
                              (smiles)
                         I made it a contest... the one who 
                         does best gets his cereal back first.
                              (and)
                         Children like to help... they only 
                         need to be kept after a little bit.

               Rachel means no harm by this, but Elaine's eyes begin to 
               storm.

                                     ELAINE
                         Oh, is that so?
                              (and)
                         No offense, lady, but I'm not so 
                         sure I like the idea of your coming 
                         in here and turning the place upside 
                         down!

               Rachel's smile fades at Elaine's trembling outburst:

                                     RACHEL
                         Please, I didn't mean...

               Abruptly Elaine rises and snatches the mop from Rachel's 
               hands.

               She mops furiously as she Continues:

                                     ELAINE
                         I know exactly what you meant! Listen, 
                         maybe I'm not a world-class housefrau, 
                         but maybe I don't have time to polish 
                         the goddamn china and keep after the 
                         kids!
                              (and)
                         It's none of your business, but I 
                         don't happen to have a man around 
                         here full time. So I sell cosmetics 
                         in a goddamn drugstore and sometimes 
                         I can even pay the rent on time! So 
                         maybe I'm not Mary Poppins, but maybe 
                         I don't need to have it jammed down 
                         my throat like this.

               She finishes the floor, hurls the mop aside with a CLATTER:

                                     ELAINE
                         There is that clean enough for you?

               Rachel is speechless, Elaine is on the point of bursting 
               into tears. At which point Fred appears at the entry in his 
               undershirt, taking in the sparkling kitchen.

                                     FRED
                         Jesus, Elaine... Somebody die and 
                         leave you a broom?

               Not a politic observation on Fred's part.

                                     ELAINE
                              (blurts)
                         Go to hell, Fred!

               And, bursting into tears, she flees the kitchen. Fred stares 
               after her.

                                     FRED
                         What's bugging her?

               Unperturbed, he crosses to the counter and the coffee pot, 
               letting his eyes take in Rachel's full figure.

               INT. ELAINE'S BEDROOM

               As Rachel comes in with Elaine's coffee, closes the door 
               behind her. Elaine is lying across the bed, sobbing.

                                     RACHEL
                         I brought your coffee.

               She takes a seat next to the bed.

                                     RACHEL
                         I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that 
                         way.

               After a moment, Elaine starts to pull herself together:

                                     ELAINE
                         It's okay.
                              (and)
                         Look, I shouldn't have blown my top. 
                         It's like... somehow... I've let 
                         everything get away from me. And you 
                         sort of made me face it.

               She takes the cup, sips the coffee. Rachel smiles at a private 
               thought.

                                     ELAINE
                         What's so funny?

                                     RACHEL
                         Fred. The way he looked when you 
                         screamed at him.

                                     ELAINE
                              (disparing)
                         God, Fred...

                                     RACHEL
                         At home you'd never hear a woman 
                         scream at a man that way.

                                     ELAINE
                         No? Why not?

                                     RACHEL
                         You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish 
                         way.
                              (then)
                         But I think it would have done me 
                         good if I could have screamed at 
                         your brother last night.

                                     ELAINE
                         Listen, I don't know what's going on 
                         or how you got mixed up with him, 
                         but don't you let that self-righteous 
                         son of a bitch push you around, okay?

               Rachel smiles.

                                     RACHEL
                         Okay.

               INT. BOOK'S CAR (MOVING)  DAY

               Book glances irritably at Rachel:

                                     BOOK
                         Now what's the problem?

                                     RACHEL
                         The problem is I don't happen to 
                         think my son should be spending all 
                         his time with a man who carried a 
                         gun under his coat and goes around 
                         whacking people.

               Book gives her a look:

                                     BOOK
                         Whacking?

                                     RACHEL
                              (firmly)
                         Yes. And I also want to leave this 
                         city.

                                     BOOK
                         Believe me, I'm trying to get this 
                         over with as fast as I can. But Samuel 
                         will probably have to come back and 
                         testify.

                                     RACHEL
                         We do not go into your courts.

                                     BOOK
                         People who don't go into our courts 
                         when they're told to sometimes go 
                         directly into our jail.

               Rachel glares at him and the ride continues on that chilly 
               note for a beat.

                                     BOOK
                         Look, I'm genuinely sorry...

                                     RACHEL
                              (snaps)
                         No you're not 
                              (off his look)
                         You're glad, because now you've got 
                         a witness.
                              (and)
                         I heard the other police talking 
                         last night.
                              (and)
                         They don't seem to like you very 
                         much.

                                     BOOK
                         They kid a lot.

                                     RACHEL
                              (glances at him)
                         I would not be too sure.

               Samuel has been glancing at Book; finally he says something 
               to his mother in German. Book gives her an inquiring look.

                                     RACHEL
                         He says you look very tired. I thought 
                         the same thing.

               Book says nothing.

                                     RACHEL
                         But not a good tired.

                                     BOOK
                         What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired.

               She doesn't bother to explain; Book settles even deeper into 
               his funk as Samuel glares at him with hostility.

               INT. IDENTIFICATION ROOM  POLICE H.Q.  DAY

               Samuel sits with Book at a desk, Rachel just behind. They 
               are looking at a police line-up of known black drug-dealers. 
               Samuel shakes his head  another negative.

               Book winks, slyly reaches into a pocket, produces a yellow 
               gumball. He surreptitiously shows it to Samuel, gives him an 
               inquiring look. It's a peace offering.

               Samuel grins, nods imperceptibly.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As Book rolls the gumball down the table to Samuel. But just 
               as Samuel is about to cover it with his hand, Rachel reaches 
               over and plucks it off the table. She shakes her head at 
               Samuel.

                                     BOOK
                              (to Rachel)
                         Just wanted to see if you were on 
                         your toes.

               EXT. CITY PARK  DAY

               Book, Sam and Rachel sit on a park bench eating a lunch of 
               hot dogs heaped with kraut.

               Book watches with amusement as Samuel wolfs down his lunch. 
               Rachel eyes him a beat. then:

                                     RACHEL
                         Your sister said you don't have a 
                         family?

                                     BOOK
                         No.

                                     RACHEL
                         She thinks you should get married 
                         and have children of your own. Instead 
                         of trying to be a father to hers. 
                         Except she thinks you're afraid of 
                         the responsibility.

               Book gives her a look:

                                     BOOK
                         Oh? Anything else?

                                     RACHEL
                         Oh yes. She thinks you like policing 
                         because you think you're right about 
                         everything. And you're the only one 
                         who can do anything. And that when 
                         you drink a lot of beer you say things 
                         like none of the other police would 
                         know a crook from a... um... bag of 
                         elbows.

               Book is staring at her. Rachel nods.

                                     RACHEL
                         I think that's what she said.

               Just then Samuel belches with huge satisfaction, drawing 
               looks from Book and a couple of passersby. Rachel smiles 
               proudly.

                                     RACHEL
                         Good appetite.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. OUTER OFFICE/WAITING ROOM, NARCOTICS DIVISION  DAY

               Rachel sits uneasily in the outer office, one or two police 
               clerks eyeing her curiously. A sign on the desk reads 
               "Narcotics Division."

               Rachel cranes forward trying to peer through a partially 
               open door.

               INT. DETECTIVES ROOM, NARCOTICS DIVISION, POLICE H.Q.  DAY

               A group of Narcotics Detectives are interrupted in mid 
               conversation by the opening of the main office door. They 
               stare in considerable surprise.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               JOHN BOOK

               Standing in the doorway, holding little Samuel by the hand.

                                     BOOK
                         Afternoon, gentlemen. I'd like you 
                         to meet Samuel Lapp. We'd like a 
                         little help.

               INT. SMALL OFFICE, NARCOTICS DIVISION  DAY

               A Narcotics Detective enters the room laden with several 
               volumes of mug shots. He puts them on the desk beside a 
               similar book which Samuel is intently studying. Sam sits on 
               the chair cushions in a big swivel rocker.

               The Detective, SGT. KAMAN, eyes Book a little suspiciously  
               internal affairs officers are not greeted warmly by the 
               working policemen in any department.

                                     KAMAN
                         There's a Sgt. Carter on the phone 
                         for you.

               Book gets up and moves to the door.

                                     KAMAN
                         And, Captain, don't want to rush 
                         you, but I'm gonna need these files 
                         back in a half hour. We got a lot of 
                         work to do round here.

               The two men leave. Samuel looks about before hopping off his 
               perch and following the direction taken by Book.

               INT. DETECTIVES ROOM, NARCOTICS DIVISION  DAY

               Through glass partitions we can see Book on the telephone in 
               a cubicle of an office.

               Samuel has drifted out of the office and is idling amid the 
               bustle of the squadroom.

               He crosses to a glass case which holds a collection of plaques 
               and framed newspaper accounts which denote instances of 
               outstanding duty and achievement.

               ANGLE THOUGH GLASS CASE

               As Samuel moves along, only half interested in what his eyes 
               are taking in, not really old enough to comprehend anyway.

               Until suddenly he freezes.

               SAMUEL'S POV  NEWSPAPER ACCOUNT

               Enlarged, prominently displayed. The headline reads: "Division 
               Chief McElroy Honored For Youth Project". Accompanying the 
               item is a large sidebar mug-shot of McElroy  clearly the 
               black man who murdered the young cop in the train station 
               men's room.

               BACK TO SAMUEL

               He stares, transfixed.

               A long beat, then Book, lowering himself to one knee next to 
               Samuel, ENTERS FRAME.

               He's watching Samuel, knowing from the boy's expression that 
               they've found their man. Samuel slowly raises his hand to 
               point at the photograph. Book gently takes the boy's small 
               hand in his, concealing the accusation from watchful eyes. 
               He smiles gently at the boy.

               INT. BOOK'S CAR (MOVING)  PHILADELPHIA  DUSK

               Rachel is curled tight in her corner of the front seat holding 
               Samuel close. Book glances at her:

                                     RACHEL
                         Why don't you arrest that man? Are 
                         you protecting him because policeman?

                                     BOOK
                              (snaps)
                         Listen, I'm the cop that polices the 
                         police. I'm not in the business of 
                         protecting crooked cops.
                              (eases up)
                         I'll make an arrest when I know 
                         everybody involved.

               Rachel shakes her head.

                                     RACHEL
                         But why would they murder...

                                     BOOK
                         Because  somehow  they knew I was 
                         getting close.
                              (and)
                         Look, it's narcotics... They make 
                         dope out of chemicals... they sell 
                         it on the street for millions of 
                         dollars. They'll do anything.
                              (and)
                         And they can get away with it because 
                         they're cops.

                                     RACHEL
                              (beat, then)
                         I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I 
                         want to go home.

                                     BOOK
                         You'll be safe. You don't have to 
                         worry.

               She says nothing.

               Another beat, then:

                                     BOOK
                         Look, they're thinking as long as 
                         they keep the killer out of Samuel's 
                         way, we can't make an I.D. There's 
                         no way they can know Samuel saw that 
                         photograph, so he's safe.

               He glances at her, but she continues ahead.

                                     BOOK
                         I mean it. You will be safe.

               Suddenly Rachel explodes:

                                     RACHEL
                         Oh yes! Of Course. Why shouldn't we 
                         feel safe in a city where the police 
                         are so busy killing each other!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. / INT. SCHAEFFER HOME, PHILADELPHIA SUBURBS  NIGHT

               The front door of Schaeffer's upper-middle class home is 
               opened by his wife MARILYN. She knows Book and is surprised 
               and delighted to see him. In the background daughter KATHY 
               is visible. Schaeffer himself appears and Book is welcomed 
               inside.

               INT. SCHAEFFER'S STUDY  NIGHT

               Schaeffer passes Book a drink.

               Book is excited, animated... the hunter, after a long chase, 
               closing on his quarry:

                                     BOOK
                         It was McElroy, Paul.

               Schaeffer gives him a sharp look:

                                     BOOK
                         Last guy I would have figured. But 
                         he's part of it.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         I hope you don't have any doubts 
                         about that.

                                     BOOK
                         If I did, I'd have kept my mouth 
                         shut...
                              (and)
                         It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons 
                         of P2P confiscated four years ago... 
                         Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.
                              (excited, explaining 
                              the thing eagerly)
                         He salts it away somewhere... he 
                         knows the stuff is potent, but the 
                         street chemists haven't figured out 
                         how to process it. But they do now.
                              (and)
                         And now the stuff is worth five-grand 
                         a pint and there are a lot of pints 
                         in a fifty-five gallon drum.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (beat)
                         Who else knows?

                                     BOOK
                         Just us.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (shakes his head)
                         Okay, what are you going to need to 
                         clean it up

                                     BOOK
                         More people... Gotta pick up where 
                         Zenovich left off. People from outside 
                         the department.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (nods)
                         Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards 
                         at Treasury. I'll take care of it.
                              (then)
                         I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut 
                         their balls off for me. I'm counting 
                         on you.

               Schaeffer pours himself another drink.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         What's your first move?

                                     BOOK
                              (expels a breath)
                         A hot shower... I haven't changed 
                         clothes in two days.

               EXT. PARKING LOT  PHILADELPHIA  NIGHT

               Book slams the front door of his car, checks it for being 
               locked, glances at a roiled newspaper in his hand (the sports 
               section of the Inquirer), starts across the parking lot toward 
               his apartment, walking as he keeps glancing down at the sports 
               section. He comes to a sort of crosswalk, stops, reads, starts 
               to take a step... and looks up.

               WHAT HE SEES

               McElroy, smiling nicely, starting across toward him from the 
               other side of the parking lot crosswalk

               BACK TO BOOK

               Freezing, eyes widening. Utterly surprised and caught.

               MCELROY

               Still smiling, he brings up his right hand out of a shopping 
               bag (which he appeared to be carrying)  letting the shopping 
               bag fall away as he does so  revealing a five-inch barrel 
               Smith and Wesson .357 blue finish revolver with a silencer. 
               Without hesitating, coming right on, still smiling, he FIRES 
               once.

               BOOK

               Already starting to leap away to one side, he is hit, driven 
               into a half-turn. He clutches at the wound, as:

               MCELROY

               Coming right on, FIRING again... the pistol's report a 
               WHOOSHING, like the opening of a bottle of cheap champagne. 
               And McElroy still smiling as:

               BOOK

               Hit... a grazing near-miss this time, but enough to send 
               Book down hard and grasping.

               MCELROY

               Lowering the pistol alongside his leg, as two MEN, barely 
               taking notice of anything, cross with their backs to Book 
               toward McElroy.

               He smiles at them.

               BOOK

               Down, muttering CURSES.

               THE SCENE

               As McElroy walks past Book, drops the pistol to the pavement, 
               keeps on going... and is gone.

               BOOK

               GROANING in pain, beginning to try to crawl crab-like. And 
               we HEAR  from the agonized recesses of Book's Dream.

                                     SCHAEFFER (V.O.)
                         Who else knows?

                                     BOOK (V.O.)
                         Just us.

               As the lights of an oncoming car  going very slowly, on its 
               way to a parking space  sweep over him and we HEAR it come 
               to a sudden, squealing stop. Book is already trying to get 
               to his feet... now succeeds, lurching into a swaying stance, 
               using an adjacent car for support. OFF SCREEN we HEAR a car 
               door slam, and footsteps hurrying in our direction, 
               accompanied by excited voices. Book HEARS, turns to face the 
               oncomers,

               ANGLE

               A fat, middle-aged MAN has approached to within some feet of 
               Book, looks on edgily:

                                     MAN
                         Hey, buddy, what's the score? Little 
                         too much to drink?

               Book stares at him, then looks down at his belly.

               BOOK'S WOUND

               As Book removes his hand we can see one of the bullets struck 
               him low in the side, just below the ribcage... the other 
               just above it (but this one inflicting only minor damage).

               THE SCENE

               As the man stares:

                                     MAN
                         Goddamn, buddy. You better get to a 
                         hospital!
                              (and)
                         Here; I'll give you a hand.

               He starts to approach, but Book shoves him away.

                                     BOOK
                         No! No hospital!

               By now the man's WIFE is hovering at a safe distance:

                                     WIFE
                         Let him alone, Henry! If he wants to 
                         die in the street, that's his 
                         business!

               But the man is not content:

                                     MAN
                         Shut up, Romona! Will ya look at 
                         that blood?

               Book has tried to lurch toward his car; the man tries to 
               intercept him:

                                     MAN
                         Come on, buddy... you're gonna bleed 
                         to death!

               Book whirls on him, his service revolver in his hand pointed 
               squarely at the fat man's face:

                                     MAN
                         Shit!

                                     WIFE
                              (quavering)
                         I told you, Henry!

               Book doesn't trust himself to speak, but the .38 is 
               sufficiently eloquent for the circumstances, He stares at 
               the fat man another beat, then hesitates, turns, starts back 
               toward his car.

               EXT. STREET  PHILADELPHIA  NIGHT

               As Book's car wheels somewhat erratically through traffic.

               INT. BOOK'S CAR (MOVING)

               Book has a gym bag open on the seat next to him, is stuffing 
               a tshirt under his belt to staunch the blood. And...

               INT. CARTER'S APARTMENT  BEDROOM  NIGHT

               As he's awakened by the RINGING bedside telephone. He snaps 
               on a lamp... He's instantly awake, not unused to such rousing 
               in the wee hours. A woman sleeps beside him.

                                     CARTER
                         Yeah...

               INTERCUT BOOK

               He's at an n.d. pay phone.

                                     BOOK
                         Listen carefully, I wrote the Amish 
                         woman's name and address on my desk 
                         calendar, I want you to lose it for 
                         me, Now. Tonight.

                                     CARTER
                         What the hell are you talking about?
                         What's happening.

                                     BOOK
                         Nothing. I'm not going to be around 
                         for a while. I'll call you when I 
                         can.

                                     CARTER
                              (alarmed)
                         Johnny, what the fuck?

                              (hard)
                         Listen to me  Schaeffer's part of 
                         it. Maybe at the top of it.

               There's a stunned silence at the other end.

                                     BOOK
                         Yeah... I can put it all together 
                         when I get back, 'Til then, you know 
                         nothing, understand? Business as 
                         usual...

                                     CARTER
                              (beat)

               INT. GUEST ROOM, ELAINE'S HOUSE  NIGHT

               As the door opens and Elaine switches on the light, rousing 
               Rachel. Elaine looks haggard.

                                     ELAINE
                         It's John. He says you have to leave 
                         now. He says it's urgent.

               She leaves the room as Rachel instantly awake, moves quickly 
               to rouse Samuel.

               EXT. BATHROOM DOOR

               Elaine is outside the bathroom listening to instructions 
               from her brother. From inside we hear the SOUND OF RUNNING 
               WATER. Elaine is puzzled but also senses the urgency.

                                     BOOK (V.O.)
                         Put my car in the garage and close 
                         the door.

                                     ELAINE
                         John, I don't understand any of this.

                                     BOOK (V.O.)

                         You don't know anything... borrowed 
                         your car. Didn't say why. And you 
                         never heard of that woman and her 
                         boy.

                                     ELAINE
                         John, why?...

                                     BOOK
                              (shouts)

               INT. BATHROOM

               Book looks at himself in the mirror, his face is pale and 
               drawn.

               He examines the wound, a cleanly drilled hole through his 
               right side, just under the rib cage. The wound continues to 
               bleed as he binds a towel tightly about him, before putting 
               his shirt back on.

               He then carefully wipes away any traces of blood on basin 
               with tissues which he flushes down the toilet.

               INT. BOOK'S CAR (MOVING)

               As he drives across town. Samuel is curled up asleep, his 
               head on Rachel's lap.

               Book gives her a look.

                              (insistent)
                         What happened?

               But Book, glancing in his rearview mirror, tenses.

               HIS POV  MIRROR

               In it we can see a police car coming on fast, with lights 
               and SIREN.

               BACK TO SCENE

               Rachel eyes Book warily.

               A beat, then the police car WAILS past. Book expels a breath.

               Rachel looks away, speaks almost sarcastically, MUTTERING.

               crosses quickly to the desk. He snaps on a light, thumbs a 
               page of the calendar. Frowns.

               A couple of plainclothesmen have paused outside the door to 
               give him a look. Meets their eyes. They move on.

               Lancaster County.

               Book glances at Rachel; she's asleep. He coughs wrackingly, 
               hurting... cinches the belt of his overcoat even tighter. 
               And...

               Coming up the long drive.

               BACK TO SCENE

               As the car pulls up in the barnyard and Eli crosses to it.

               Suddenly the car door flies open and Samuel jumps out, races 
               across the barnyard to hurl himself into the old man.

               ANGLE AT CAR

               As Rachel steps out of the passenger's side, Book remains 
               seated.

               He lets his eyes travel around the farm.

                                     RACHEL
                         Stay for awhile. Rest. I'll make 
                         coffee and breakfast.

                         What about Samuel? Will you come 
                         back to take him to trial?

               Book starts the engine:

                         There isn't going to be one.

               Rachel stares at him, not sure what he means. Then backs 
               away, closing the door. Book begins to turn the car around 
               in the barnyard.

               ANGLE

               As Eli crosses to Rachel, his arm around Samuel.

                         Momma  look.

               They glance in the direction Samuel is looking.

               THEIR POV  BOOK'S CAR

               The car has failed to take a bend in the road and is now 
               bouncing across an adjoining ploughed field. It's knocked 
               over a tall birdhouse by the roadside. The car finally comes 
               to rest against a bank of earth.

               She stares...

               running toward the car.

               Eli works fast harnessing his mules to an open wagon. He 
               hops up to the front seat and urges them to trot.

               ANGLE AT BOOK'S CAR

               We see that Rachel has made Book as comfortable as possible 
               in the front seat of the car and is packing the wound under 
               his trenchcoat with material ripped from her apron. 
               Momentarily he comes awake:

                         Gunshot... they'll file reports... 
                         they'll find me.

                                     RACHEL
                         But 

               Book reaches up to grip her arm fiercely:

                                     BOOK
                         And when they find me, they'll find 
                         your boy!

               He slips under again. Rachel stares at him, realizing the 
               price he's paid in returning them to safety.

               She reaches out, touches him gently.

               But the moment is broken by...

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As Eli reins up in the springwagon. He climbs down, crosses 
               to glance into the car.

                         Looks dead...

               And together they begin to lift Book from the car and place 
               him in the back of the springwagon. And...

               Where Eli is looking out a window.

               HIS POV  BUGGY

               An Amish buggy coming up the drive, past Book' s car.

               ANGLE IN BEDROOM

               Where Book lies on a bed. Rachel is bathing his wound with 
               warm water from a pan.

               Eli appears in the doorway.

                                     ELI
                         Stoltzfus is coming.

               Rachel looks at him, nods.

               Eli frowns at Book's holstered pistol lying atop his neatly 
               folded clothes on a chair near the bed.

                                     ELI
                         That has no place in this house.

                         I know.

               She picks up the pile of clothes and the pistol and places 
               them in a chest.

                         Thank you for coming, Stoltzfus.

               Stoltzfus's eyes have gone to the bed:

                         That's the English is it?

               As Stoltzfus runs his fingers lightly over the vicinity of 
               Book's wound:

                         I feel... burning.

               WIDER

               As Stoltzfus, in his shirt sleeves and concentrating mightily, 
               moistens his fingertips with saliva, continues the 
               examination.

               Finally he steps back.

                                     STOLTZFUS
                         This man should be treated in town.
                              (indicates)

                         of infection, and he has lost a great 
                         deal of blood.

               Rachel looks at Stoltzfus, then turns away, torn by her 
               dilemma.

               Her eyes fall on Samuel. Gently she ushers him from the room:

                                     RACHEL
                         Go help Levi with the car, Samuel.

               She closes the door after him, then turns to face Eli and 
               Stoltzfus:

                                     RACHEL
                         No, he must stay here.

               Stoltzfus gives Eli a puzzled look. And:

                                     ELI
                         Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if 
                         he dies? Then the sheriff will come. 
                         They'll say we broke their laws 

                                     RACHEL
                         We'll pray that he doesn't die! But 
                         if he does, then we'll find a way so 
                         no one knows!

                         Rachel, this is a man's life, we 
                         hold it in our hands.

                         here, the people who did this to him 
                         will come for Samuel.

               Rachel beseeches them helplessly:

                         What else can we do?

                                     STOLTZFUS
                         Make a poultice... three parts milk, 
                         two parts linseed oil... for the 
                         infection.

               I'll send Mary by with some teas I will brew myself.

                                     RACHEL
                         Thank you.

               Stoltzfus turns to Eli:

                                     STOLTZFUS
                         Lapp, I'll have to speak with the 
                         diener on this matter.

                                     ELI
                              (nods)
                         As you see fit, Stoltzfus.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SICKROOM  LAPS FARM  NIGHT

               As Rachel enters, turns up a kerosene lamp which is burning 
               low at bedside. She's carrying the poultice Stoltzfus ordered.

               Book's brow is beaded with sweat.

               Rachel seats herself next to the bed, strips away the sweat-
               soaked sheet. Her eyes take in his bare torso, and we should 
               get the feeling that there's rather more male animal on 
               display here just now than she's quite comfortable with.

               She begins to apply the poultice.

               ANGLE

               As Book rouses to semi-consciousness, in his delirium he 
               recoils with alarm.

                                     RACHEL
                         It's all right! You have got to lie 
                         still.

               Book stares up at her without recognition, but some of what 
               she says seems to penetrate. He quiets.

                                     RACHEL
                              (soothingly)
                         Yes, much better...

               ANGLE

               As Book lapses back into sleep. Rachel hasn't removed her 
               hand from his chest. Abruptly she does so.

               She finds herself wondering about this man lying before her, 
               so suddenly a part of her life. She notices details; bruises, 
               scars, the knuckles are hard, grazed, a tattoo on one 
               shoulder. While lost in this reverie, the delirious 
               Philadelphia policeman begins to mutter. Incoherently at 
               first, then the words take shape  swear words; curses; fuck 
               this and that; shit; etc. Rachel rises abruptly, her cheeks 
               coloring, as the barrage of language pours from his mouth. 
               She beats a hasty retreat closing the door swiftly behind 
               her.

               INT. SCHAEFFER'S OFFICE  DAY

               He's on the phone:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Looks like we're going to need some 
                         help from you folks down there.

               INT. LANCASTER COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE  DAY

               Where an UNDERSHERIFF is on the phone:

                                     UNDERSHERIFF
                         ...want to help any way we can, Chief, 
                         but you got to understand we've got 
                         upwards of seven thousand Amish over 
                         here.

               And that's just Lancaster County.

               INTERCUT SCHAEFFER

               Who is trying to control his impatience:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         I've got the woman's name, Sheriff. 
                         Lapp. Rachel Lapp. That should 
                         simplify your work.

               The Undersheriff frowns. He doesn't like being talked down 
               to.

                                     UNDERSHERIFF
                         How about an address?

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Ah... no.

                                     UNDERSHERIFF
                              (frowns)
                         Maybe a road or route number?

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Sorry.

               The Undersheriff is not impressed.

                                     UNDERSHERIFF
                         Problem is, Chief, 'bout every third 
                         Amishman around here is named Lapp. 
                         That or Yoder. Or Hochstetler.
                              (and)
                         Chief, if the Amish have taken your 
                         man in, I wouldn't want to hang from 
                         a rope until you find him.

               ANGLE

               Schaeffer is tight-lipped with contained fury:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Thank you, Sheriff. It's been an 
                         education.

               He hangs up. A beat; the man is a study in frustration. Then 
               he glances up.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Standing in his doorway are the two plainclothesmen who 
               spotted Carter in Book's office in the earlier scene. And...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LAPP FARM  DAY

               A bright, sunny afternoon.

               SAMUEL

               Where he's leading a team of horses to the barn. In the b.g. 
               three buggies are parked in the barnyard, traces empty. 
               Visitors.

               ANGLE IN SICKROOM

               Where Book lies in the bed. His fever seems to have subsided. 
               He's coming awake, tries to focus on the room.

               BOOK'S POV  CLERGY

               PANNING the four men in Amish black who are standing around 
               the bed looking down at Book, muttering among themselves in 
               German.

               These include TSCHANTZ, the district bishop, a hawk-nosed, 
               sterneyed old fellow; Stoltzfus, a deacon as well as a healer; 
               and two preachers, ERB and HERSHBERGER. Eli stands somewhat 
               apart.

               ANGLE

               Another moment of silence, then Book opens his eyes.

               Tschantz rumbles in German.

               SUBTITLES OVER.

                                     TSCHANTZ
                         Well, Stoltzfus, another Lazarus to 
                         your credit.

                                     STOLTZFUS
                         He was touched by God's hand.

               Tschantz grunts, motions, for the other clergy aside with 
               him.

               Rachel enters briskly with a steaming pot of tea and a cup, 
               smiles.

                                     RACHEL
                         Hello.

               Book stares at her, then at the old bearded gentlemen.

                                     BOOK
                              (closing his eyes)
                         Who are they?

                                     RACHEL
                         The leadership of our district... 
                         the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the 
                         one with no hair on top. They decided 
                         to come and see you for themselves. 
                         Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came 
                         the first day. I think he saved your 
                         life.

                                     BOOK
                         Can I have something to drink?

               Rachel brings him tea.

                                     BOOK
                         Does anybody know I'm here?

                                     RACHEL
                         Only the elders.

                                     BOOK
                         How long?

                                     RACHEL
                         What?

                                     BOOK
                         How long have I been here?

                                     RACHEL
                         Two days.

                                     BOOK
                              (a beat)
                         Listen, thank you. Thanks for 
                         everything. But I've got to go.

                                     RACHEL
                              (frowns)
                         But you can't.

               He tries to rise, falls back faint. Rachel rearranges the 
               sheet.

                                     RACHEL
                         See. Anyway, you don't have any 
                         clothes on. And besides that, Bishop 
                         Tschantz wants to talk to you when 
                         you feel better.

               The elders appear to have concluded their conference, and 
               are filing out. Stoltzfus pauses at bedside.

                                     STOLTZFUS
                         Rest, Mr. Book. That's the ticket. 
                         And drink my of my tea.

               He goes. Book is still fending off the dizziness. Rachel 
               puts the teacup to his lips.

                                     BOOK
                         Tell him his tea stinks.

                                     RACHEL
                              (smiles)
                         You tell him. When you're able.

               He looks like he's about to drop off again. Rachel rises.

                                     RACHEL
                              (from the door)
                         We're all very happy that you're 
                         going to live, John Book. We didn't 
                         quite know what we were going to do 
                         with you if you died.

               That penetrates for a moment just before Book slips into 
               sleep again.

               INT. LAPP LIVING ROOM  DAY

               As the rather worrisome Hershberger frowns:

                                     HERSHBERGER
                         ...but a gunshot wound. Very serious.

                                     TSCHANTZ
                         It is not the first time we have 
                         done this. In the Englischer war of 
                         the revolution, old Elmer Miller's 
                         grandfather took in gunshot English 
                         soldiers.
                              (a tad of pride)
                         Saved them, too.

               They all nod. What Tschantz says is well known. Then:

                                     ERB
                         Still, he should be among his own 
                         people.

               Rachel enters on this last.

                                     RACHEL
                         He'll leave as soon as he is able. 
                         He already wants to go.

               Hershberger gives her a gloomy look, turns to Stoltzfus:

                                     HERSHBERGER
                         How long will that be, Stoltzfus?

                                     STOLTZFUS
                              (shrugs)
                         A month. Maybe less. With God's 
                         healing love.

               EXT. BOOK'S SISTER'S HOUSE  PHILADELPHIA  DAY

               Schaeffer is knocking at the front doors. A beat, then Elaine 
               opens it cautiously, peers out.

                                     ELAINE
                              (half fearfully)
                         Did you find him?

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Not yet.

               Suddenly her eyes blaze, she starts to close the door:

                                     ELAINE
                         Then go away, you bastard.

               Schaeffer quickly  but gently  prevents her from shutting 
               it.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Elaine, I've come to apologize for 
                         Lt. McElroy. He overstated the 
                         department's position.

                                     ELAINE
                              (bitterly)
                         He accused John of taking kickbacks. 
                         And you know  anybody who knows 
                         John  knows that's a goddamn lie!

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (smoothly)
                         Of course, Elaine. But as long as 
                         there's any question, better Johnny 
                         should come back and clear his name.

                                     ELAINE
                              (cuts in)
                         Better you should get off my front 
                         porch before I get my mace!

                         Elaine, I don't want to have to take 
                         you in for questioning. You've got 
                         his car, you were the last to see 
                         him 

                                     ELAINE
                              (clipped)
                         I don't know where he is.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         But... if you had to guess?

               McElroy watching.

               THEIR POV  FRONT DOOR

               We see a final exchange between Elaine and Schaeffer. Elaine 
               forces the door shut. Schaeffer turns, walks slowly to his 
               car.

               INT. SCHAEFFER'S CAR

               As Schaeffer opens the door, climbs in, sinks wearily into 
               the seat, beside McElroy.

                                     MCELROY
                         She say where he is?

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         I don't think she knows.

               Schaeffer is staring grimly ahead.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         What about Carter?

                                     MCELROY
                         Tight. But I'm working on him.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Lean on him.

               EXT. LAPP FARM  LANCASTER COUNTY  NIGHT

               REESTABLISHING, and TIGHTENING to the upstairs sickroom window 
               where a lamp dimly burns.

               INT. SICKROOM

               As Samuel comes in with a fresh bedpan. Book is lying asleep 
               on the bed.

               Samuel puts the bedpan down, checks to make sure Book is 
               indeed asleep, then quietly crosses to the foot of the bed 
               and opens the clothes chest.

               ANGLE

               Book's big .38 revolver lies holstered atop his folded 
               clothes.

               Fascinated, Samuel picks it up, admiring the heavy burled 
               pistol grips. Unable to resist, he starts to remove the weapon 
               from the holster, then pauses to steal a look. OFF SCREEN...

               BOOK

               His eyes are open and watching Samuel icily, which gives the 
               boy something of a jolt.

                         Give me that.

               Mutely, Samuel hands Book the pistol from arm's length. He 
               looks on as Book takes the pistol out of the holster, shoots 
               the boy another look, then snaps open the cylinder and shakes 
               out the heavy, copper-jacketed bullets into his palm. He 
               snaps the cylinder closed again, then nods to Samuel.

               The boy edges closer.

                         You ever handle a pistol like this, 
                         Samuel?

                                     SAMUEL
                              (swallows)
                         No pistol. Ever.

                         Tell you what  I'm going to let you 
                         handle this one. But only if you 
                         promise not to say anything to your 
                         momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't 
                         understand.

                                     SAMUEL
                              (grins)
                         Okay, Mr. Book.

               Book smiles. Then he gives the boy a playful, John Wayne-
               tough guy wink as he cocks and uncorks the pistol, 
               demonstrating the action.

               He finally hands it over to Samuel, butt first.

                         Call me John.

               The boy tries to imitate Book's one-handed expertise, but 
               his hands are too small. Book smiles.

               Samuel finally manages to get the thing cocked, using two 
               hands, and Book reaches over to guide the muzzle away so 
               that it's not pointed at him.

                                     BOOK
                         You don't want to point that at people 
                         you just started calling by their 
                         first name.

               Samuel levels the pistol at the door and, just as he snaps 
               the trigger, Rachel enters, pulls up short in some dismay to 
               find her son has a gun pointed at her. Samuel blanches and 
               Book winces, knowing there's heavy weather ahead.

                                     RACHEL
                              (snaps)
                         Samuel!

               Samuel quickly hands the pistol back to Book, who holsters 
               it:

                                     RACHEL
                         Wait for me downstairs.

               Samuel quickly exits, and Rachel angrily advances on Book.

                                     RACHEL
                         John Book, I would appreciate it if, 
                         during the time you are with us, you 
                         would have as little to do with Samuel 
                         as possible.

                                     BOOK
                         Nobody meant any harm. The boy was 
                         curious. I unloaded the gun -

                                     RACHEL
                         It's not the gun. Don't you 
                         understand... It's you. What you 
                         stand for.
                              (and)
                         That is not for Samuel.

               Book looks at her thoughtfully.

               Rachel softens a bit:

                                     RACHEL
                         Please, it has nothing to do with 
                         you personally.

               He hands her the holstered gun and the loose bullets.

                                     BOOK
                         Put it up someplace Samuel can't get 
                         it.

               A beat, then Rachel, takes the pistol and starts to go. Book 
               stops her:

                                     BOOK
                         Friends?

               Rachel glances back at him, smiles and nods. And...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KITCHEN  LAPP FARMHOUSE  NIGHT

               Book's holstered gun and bullets at center table. Eli sits 
               on one side, a chastened Samuel on the other. Rachel looks 
               on from the b.g.

               Eli knows that this is as important a dialogue as he will 
               ever have with his grandson: at issue is one of the central 
               pillars of the Amish way.

                                     ELI
                         The gun  that gun of the hand  is 
                         for the taking of human life. Would 
                         you kill another man? Eh?

               Samuel stares at it, not meeting his grandfather's eyes. Eli 
               leans forward, extends his hands ceremonially.

                                     ELI
                         What you take into your hands, you 
                         take into your heart.

               A beat, then Samuel musters some defiance.

                                     SAMUEL
                         I would only kill a bad man.

                                     ELI
                         Only a bad man. I see. And you know 
                         these bad men on sight? You are able 
                         to look into their hearts and see 
                         this badness?

                                     SAMUEL
                         I can see what they do.

               Now he meets Eli's eyes:

                                     SAMUEL
                         I have seen it.

               Eli expels a deep sigh; then:

                                     ELI
                         And having seen, you would become 
                         one of them?
                              (intent... gesturing)
                         Don't you see...? The hand leads the 
                         arm leads the shoulder leads the 
                         head... leads the heart. The one 
                         goes into the other into the other 
                         into the other... And you have 
                         changed, and gone amongst them...

               He breaks off, bows his head for a moment. Then he fixes the 
               boy with a stern eye and, driving he heel of his palm firmly 
               into the tabletop with enormous intensity:

                                     ELI
                         "Wherefore come out from among them 
                         and be ye separate, saith the Lord!"

                                     ELI
                              (indicating pistol; 
                              continuing from 
                              Corinthians 6:17)
                         "And touch not the unclean thing!"

               His intensity tinged with righteous anger, he is hugely 
               impressive.

               EXT. WASHHOUSE  NEAR KITCHEN  NIGHT 

               Book stands near the door to the kitchen, and has heard most 
               or all of Eli's words. He turns, and painfully makes his way 
               into the washhouse, moving quietly, hoping no one will come 
               out from the kitchen.

               EXT. BARN  LAPP FARM  DAY

               Samuel harnesses up the family mare, and backs her into the 
               traces of the buggy.

               INT. BOOK'S BEDROOM  DAY

               Book stands at the window in a worn robe. Below, through the 
               window, we can see Samuel and Eli in the barnyard. A beat, 
               then Book crosses impatiently back to his bed, sits down, 
               picks up a dog-earred copy of The American Dairyman. There's 
               a stack of well-thumbed farm magazines and copies of The 
               Budget (the Amish newspaper) on the bedside table.

               There's a knock. Rachel enters carrying a pile of clothing. 
               She smiles.

                                     RACHEL

                         Yes. It's good that someone can have 
                         the use of them. Besides, in your 
                         clothes you'd stand out to strangers.

                         No. I'd want a public phone.

               Rachel's face clouds.

                                     RACHEL
                         Well... the store at Saltzburg...
                              (then briskly)
                         But you won't be going to Saltzburg 
                         for a while.

                         I'm going this morning.

                         But Stoltzfus said...

                              (cutting in)
                         I know what he said.

                                     RACHEL
                         You can go with Eli. He's taking 
                         Samuel to school. But you'll have to 
                         hurry.

               Rachel turns to leave when Book calls her back.

                                     BOOK
                         Rachel.

               She turns to look at him. It's the first time he's used her 
               name.

                                     BOOK
                         Thanks.

               She smiles and leaves.

               EXT. FARMHOUSE  DAY

               Eli calls impatiently from the buggy. Samuel sits beside 
               him.

                                     ELI
                         Hurry up now, John Book!

               INT. KITCHEN  DAY

               Rachel washing dishes turns on hearing Book enter. She laughs 
               out loud at the sight of him in his Amish gear, and rightly 
               so  the pants are highwater, the hat low-rise, the jacket 
               ill-fitting.

               Book looks self-conscious, even a little sheepish.

               Outside another SHOUT from Eli.

                                     RACHEL
                         You'd better go.

               Book looks embarrassed.

                                     BOOK
                         My... eh... gun?

               The smile fades from Rachel's face as she reaches up into a 
               cupboard. She passes the gun in its holster to Book. He 
               fastens it about him. The contradiction of an "Armed Amishman" 
               increases the awkwardness between them. Book turns his back 
               to her and checks the weapon. He turns back to her smiling 
               in an odd way.

                                     BOOK
                         The... bullets?

                                     RACHEL
                         Oh. The bullets.

               She takes them out of a disused coffee jar, passes them to 
               Book.

                                     BOOK
                              (attempting a joke)
                         Not much good without them.

               INT. BUGGY  COUNTRY ROAD  DAY

               Samuel sits between Eli and Book. Both men stare straight 
               ahead.

               Eli looks particularly stern. It's pretty clear he doesn't 
               like this Englishman wearing the clothes of his faith.

               EXT. AMISH ONE-TEACHER-SCHOOL  DAY

               With awave Samuel runs into the schoolyard to join his 
               friends. A teacher begins ringing a bell.

               INT. STORE  SALTZBURG

               Book on the telephone waiting for his call to be answered. 
               He looks about him  several Amish and Dithers mingle in the 
               shop.

               Book-has gotten a coke from a machine, seems a bit self-
               conscious shout it sips at it surreptitiously... A voice 
               comes on the line; it's that of Book's partner.

                                     CARTER
                         Yeah?

               A silence.

                                     BOOK
                         It's me.

                         Never mind. I'm coming in to take 
                         care of business. How hot am I?

                                     CARTER
                              (low, urgent)
                         Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.

                                     BOOK
                         I'm coming.

                                     CARTER
                         Listen, Johnny, don't do anything 
                         stupid. You couldn't get within a 
                         mile of Schaeffer right now. So stay 
                         put... Stay in touch  I'll let you 
                         know when maybe it makes sense.

               A beat as Book considers that.

                                     CARTER
                              (edgily)
                         You hear me?

                                     BOOK
                              (finally)
                         I hear you. I'll stay in touch.

                                     CARTER
                         That's more like it.
                              (and)
                         Where are you at, anyway?

               Book allows himself a small smile, regarding his Amish image 
               reflected in the window of the store.

                                     BOOK
                         Where I'm at is maybe 1890.

                                     CARTER
                              (uncomprehending)
                         Say again?

                                     BOOK
                         Make that 1790.

               He hangs up. A beat, then he stares toward the door of the 
               store.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               Book works on his car. The battery has gone flat and he's 
               trying to charge it up by running wires to a battery mounted 
               under the front seat of the Lapp buggy.

               Eli stands at the barn door staring at him, again the 
               disapproving look.

                                     ELI
                         If you are well enough to do that 
                         thing, you can do work for me.

               Book is genuinely apologetic.

                                     BOOK
                         Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind 
                         me plugging in to your battery. Mine's 
                         dead... How can I help? What can I 
                         do?

                                     ELI
                         Maybe milking.

                                     BOOK
                              (eyes Eli)

                         Cows. You know, cows?

                                     BOOK
                         I've seen pictures.

                         Good, you start tomorrow.

               INT. BOOK'S ROOM  LAPP FARM  NIGHT

               Where Book lies asleep. A beat, then Eli comes in carrying a 
               lamp.

               He pauses a moment to peer at the sleeping figure with 
               undisguised anticipation. Then he gives him a jarring thump:

                                     ELI
                              (briskly)
                         Veck oufl. Time for milking.

               Book comes groggily awake as Eli exits. He gropes for his 
               watch.

               INSERT WATCHFACE

               It reads 4:30 a.m.

               BACK TO BOOK

               As he stares at it in disbelief.

               INT. BARN

               As the milk herd of half dozen or so cows ambles in with 
               Samuel prodding them along, headed for the milking stalls. 
               Book looks on in the lamplight, nonplused.

               SAMUEL

               Where he's pitching hay into the cow's feed-troughs.

               BOOK, ELI

               Where the old man is showing Book how to milk a cow by hand. 
               We see Rachel watching from the milkhouse door (steam from 
               scalding milk cans rising behind her).

                                     ELI
                         Good, firm twist and pull, eh?
                              (and)
                         Right. Now you try it.

               Book gives him a look, takes over the milking stool. The cow 
               shoots him a rather skeptical look over her shoulder. Book 
               bends to his task.

                                     ELI
                         Didn't you hear me, Book? Pull! You 
                         never had your hands on a teat before?

                                     BOOK
                              (grimly)
                         Not one this big.

               Eli unexpectedly finds this hilarious, cackles, gives Book a 
               comradely, man-of-the-world thump on the shoulder that jars 
               him.

               Then he moves off. Book bends to his task, and...

               ANGLE  RACHEL

               Grinning, giggling, covering her mouth with one hand.

               As he pours a pail full of milk into a large, stainless steel 
               milk can.

               EXT. BARN

               As the milk herd is released back into the pasture. Book

               BOOK'S POV  HORIZON

               And dawnfire etching the hilltops. The BELLHOUSE behind the 
               house, the sun reflecting from the heavy bell beneath its 
               small roof.

               BACK TO BOOK

               Something in him can't help but respond to the beauty.

               A beat, then he blows on his hands, rubs them briskly together 
               against the morning chill, and turns back to the barn.

               EXT. LAPP FARMHOUSE  DAY

               It is later in the morning. Rachel comes out onto the porch, 
               tosses a pan of dirty dishwater off onto the grass, looks 
               toward the barn.

               ANGLE  THE BARN

               Eli and Book standing in one of the open doorways, looking 
               in.

               INT. THE BARN

               ANGLE FAVORING Luke, one of Eli's team of fine mules as Samuel 
               opens the stall gate. The beast is skittish, obviously 
               afflicted with something of a behavioral problem.

               But he allows Samuel to lead him out.

               BOOK, ELI

               As Samuel brings Luke out. Eli is now harnessing the other 
               mule of the team to a large manure-spreader. But as Luke 
               nears Book, his eyes widen and he shies, almost hauling Samuel 
               off his feet.

                                     BOOK
                              (alarmed)
                         Careful, son 

               Book moves to Samuel's aid; a gesture which proves a serious 
               mistake. Luke erupts into a SCREAMING, bucking cyclone. Samuel 
                who no doubt has been here before  dives nimbly for cover 
               as a flying hoof nearly takes Book's head off.

               Then Eli hustles into the fray, pushing Book aside as he 
               BELLOWS belligerently in German at the rearing animal. Finally 
               he gives Luke a swat upside the head that seems, somehow, to 
               have the effect of quieting the beast instantly.

               ANGLE

               Samuel gives the shaken Book a look:

                                     SAMUEL
                         That's Luke. He doesn't like 
                         strangers.

                                     BOOK
                              (still shaken)
                         You don't say.

               Eli leads the pacified mule back to the traces, grunting at 
               Book.

                                     ELI
                         Have to teach you mules, too, I guess.

               EXT. FIELD NEAR FARMHOUSE  DAY

               Book collects the pieces of the birdhouse which his car 
               knocked down the day of his attempted departure. He pauses 
               as a figure approaches. We recognize Daniel Hochstetler, 
               Rachel's would-be suitor. He heads for Book with an outgoing 
               smile and outstretched hand. Here's a likable man who likes 
               people.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         Good morning. Book, is it? You are 
                         the Yankee they talk about?

                                     BOOK
                         I thought I was the English.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         English, Yankee. It's the same. My 
                         name is Daniel. Daniel Hochstetler.
                              (sizes up his clothes)
                         You look plain, Book.
                              (grinning)
                         Very plain.

               Book is not particularly amused.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         I came to see Rachel Lapp.

                                     BOOK
                         Try the house.

               Hochstetler gives Book a powerful clap on the shoulder.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                              (genially)
                         You bet. you take care of yourself.

               Hochstetler heads for the house. Book stares after him with 
               some interest.

               ANGLE

               As Rachel emerges from the house to greet him. She also 
               catches sight of Book and she pauses, a shadow of confusion 
               crossing her expression for an instant.

               And Hochstetler doesn't miss it either.

               Then she gives her suitor a genuine smile of welcome.

               HOG PENS

               Book, having gathered up the pieces of the bird house, is 
               headed toward the outbuildings, passing by hog pens. He 
               glances toward the house:

               HIS POV  THE BACK PORCH

               Where Rachel and Hochstetler are sitting in a porch swing, 
               sharing a pitcher of lemonade.

               BACK TO BOOK

               Thoughtful... He glances at the hog pen as a huge sow SQUEALS 
               and angrily noses her young ones away from the trough so she 
               can feed.

                                     BOOK
                         Pigs.

               INT. CARPENTRY SHOP, LAPP FARM  DAY

               Book works on repairing the broken birdhouse when Rachel 
               enters.

               BOOK

               He uses a drawknife on a piece of 2x4, with some obvious 
               expertise.

                                     RACHEL
                         Eli is a fine carpenter. Best in the 
                         district. He and his father built 
                         the big house themselves forty years 
                         ago.

                                     BOOK
                         Oh?
                              (and)
                         What happened to Hochstetler?

                                     RACHEL
                         We had some lemonade and he left.

                                     BOOK
                         A real fireball.

               Rachel smiles. Book crosses to a workbench and selects another 
               tool.

                                     RACHEL
                         You know carpentry?

                                     BOOK
                         I did some carpentry summers when I 
                         was going to school.

                                     RACHEL
                         What else can you do?

                                     BOOK
                              (really annoyed)
                         I can whack people. I'm hell at 
                         whacking.

                                     RACHEL
                         Whacking is not of much use on a 
                         farm.

                                     BOOK
                         Now hold on. There's a lot of people 
                         who think being a cop is a legitimate 
                         job.

                                     RACHEL
                         I'm sorry. I'm sure it is.

               She turns, starts to go. Then turns back, eyeing his makeshift 
               garb:

                                     RACHEL
                         Tonight I'll let out those trousers 
                         for you.

               Stifling a smile, she goes. HOLD on Book a beat, then...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAPP FARMHOUSE  DINING ROOM

               Eli is seated at the head of the table, Book opposite Samuel 
               and Rachel. The table is piled high with an incredible amount 
               of food.

               Eli eyes Book cagily, waves his fork at him:

                                     ELI
                         Eat up, Book. What's the matter with 
                         your appetite?

                                     BOOK
                         Guess I'm not used to so much.

                                     ELI
                              (snorts)
                         Not used to hard work. That's what 
                         makes an appetite.

               Book swallows that one. With difficulty. Rachel intervenes:

                                     RACHEL
                         Eli, John is a carpenter.
                              (conciliatory 
                              afterthought)
                         As well as being a fine policeman.

                                     ELI
                         Eh? Well then, maybe he can go to 
                         Zook's barn-raising, eh? See how 
                         good a carpenter.

               Book can't refuse the challenge.

                                     BOOK
                         Sure.

                                     RACHEL
                         But... You may not be well enough.

                                     BOOK
                         I'll drink some more of Stoltzfus' 
                         tea.

               EXT. / INT. BARN  NIGHT

               As Rachel, lamp in hand, walks up to the barn. She looks in 
               to find Book tinkering with the battery hookup to the Lapp 
               buggy.

               He glances up as she enters:

                                     BOOK
                         Hi...

               As she sets her lamp down near the one he's using.

                                     RACHEL
                              (beat)
                         When will you be going?

                                     BOOK
                         Not long... A few days.

               Another beat as Rachel watches him... Book, checking out the 
               battery power, hits the radio  and suddenly from the 
               Twentieth Century comes the sound of one of its major 
               inventions  rock and roll.

               It fills the barn, but Book turns up the volume a click more 
               even and, eyeing Rachel, starts moving with the beat. It's 
               his culture, coming through loud and clear, as incongruous 
               as it all might seem with the tough Philly cop decked out in 
               Amish.

               Rachel can't help but laugh... Sensing her response, Book 
               sweeps her up and they boogie in the lamplight, Rachel 
               alternately protesting and laughing.

                                     BOOK
                         You like it... Don't you?

               Rachel, confused, protests:

                                     RACHEL
                         No... You just stop 

               But she doesn't really want to. Book grins:

                                     BOOK
                              (mock alarm)
                         Next thing you know you'll be off 
                         drinking beer and racing motorcycles.

               And it goes on... Rachel alternately protesting and laughing.

               ANGLE  THE BARN DOOR

               As Eli suddenly appears. He glowers for an instant, 
               thunderstruck, then BELLOWS:

                                     ELI
                         Rachel!

               THE SCENE

               As Book and Rachel's dancing comes to a sudden halt. Both 
               turn, look at Eli. Rachel regards him level-eyed, without 
               discernible alarm. Book, looking a bit sheepish, goes over, 
               turns off the radio, as:

                                     ELI
                              (in the dialect)
                         What is this? This Myusick?

               Book hesitates, then starts to say something:

                                     BOOK
                         It's not her fault. I 

               But he gets such a look from Eli that he turns, goes out.

                                     ELI
                              (in the dialect)
                         How can this be? How can you do such 
                         a thing? Is this plain? Is this the 
                         ordnung?

                                     RACHEL
                         I have done nothing against the 
                         ordnung.

                                     ELI
                              (in the dialect)
                         Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this 
                         man to our house. With his gun of 
                         the hand. You bring fear to this 
                         house. Fear of English with guns 
                         coming after. You bring blood and 
                         whispers of more blood. Now English 
                         music... and you are dancing to 
                         English music! And you call this 
                         nothing?

                                     RACHEL
                         I have committed no sin.

                                     ELI
                              (in English)
                         No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, 
                         it does not look...
                              (tone softening... in 
                              the dialect)
                         Don't you know there has been talk? 
                         Talk about you, not him. Talk about 
                         going to the Bishop. About having 
                         you... shunned!

                                     RACHEL
                         That is idle talk.

                                     ELI
                              (in English, pleading)
                         Do not make light of it, Rachel. 
                         They can do it... quick! Like that! 
                         And then... then I can not sit at 
                         table with you. I can not take a 
                         thing from your hand. I... I can not 
                         go with you to meeting!
                              (the old man almost 
                              breaks down as, in 
                              the dialect)
                         Rachel, good Rachel, you must not go 
                         too far! Dear child!

               Rachel is annoyed  also touched, no doubt, by the old man's 
               plea  but irked by his condescending tone.

                                     RACHEL
                         I am not a child.

                                     ELI
                              (suddenly stern again)
                         You are acting like one!

                                     RACHEL
                         I will be the judge of that.

                                     ELI
                              (fierce as a prophet)
                         No! They will be the judge of that! 
                         And so will I... if you shame me!

                                     RACHEL
                              (blinking a tear now, 
                              but meeting his gaze)
                         You shame yourself.

               And shaken  but proud and erect  she turns and walks out.

               INT. SCHAEFFER'S OFFICE  NIGHT

               Carter sits, Schaeffer prowls... slowly, letting silences 
               grow before he strikes again with another softly-snarled 
               question or statement.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You know where he is.

                                     CARTER
                         Wrong.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You'd lie to protect him.

                                     CARTER
                              (cool)
                         Probably.

               Schaeffer snaps around, glares at him.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You admit you're lying?

                                     CARTER
                              (shakes head)
                         I admit I don't know where he is.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You're the first one he'll contact.

                                     CARTER
                              (sighing)
                         He's got my number.

               Schaeffer stops, stands in front of Carter, takes a deep 
               breath... suddenly smiles. And is abruptly (as he is capable 
               of being) the man of charm and gentlemanly reason. He even 
               CHUCKLES as he begins:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         It's funny. I know he's hiding 
                         somewhere with the Amish, I know it.
                              (a quick glance at 
                              Carter)
                         Can you imagine John Book at a prayer 
                         meeting? Our John Book?

               Schaeffer CHUCKLES again, looks hopefully again at Carter.

               Carter looks back, stony-eyed. Schaeffer makes another abrupt 
               shift in form... but still speaks softly.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Either you're a member of the club 
                         or you aren't, Elton.
                              (he nods his head, as)
                         Tell me what you know...

                                     CARTER
                         What I know, Paul, is...
                              (nodding his head)
                         He's going to take you out...

               EXT. LAPP FARM  LANCASTER COUNTY  DAY

               As Book pauses by the barn door, glances over his shoulder.

               HIS POV  BUGGY

               With trace horse harnessed... Samuel and Eli loading 
               provisions into the buggy, standing down by the house.

               BACK TO BOOK  INT. / EXT. BARN

               As he goes into the barn.

               Book approaches Luke's stall warily... and as he does so the 
               temperamental mule, reacting to form, starts to skitter, his 
               hooves CRACKING against the walls of the stall. Book flinches.

               Book starts to talk gently to the animal:

                                     BOOK
                         All right, you nasty son of a bitch, 
                         we're going to be friends whether 
                         you like it or not.

               Then, summoning his resolve, he carefully opens the stall 
               gate.

               ANGLE

               As Luke eyes him balefully, Book reaches into his pocket, 
               brings out some lumps of sugar.

                                     BOOK
                         See... Sugar. You like sugar, don't 
                         you for Christ's sake?

               Finally, keeping a mistrustful eye on Book, Luke condescends 
               to eat. Book nods with satisfaction.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Rachel has entered the barn, is watching Book with a puzzled 
               expression.

                                     RACHEL
                              (surprised)
                         Well...

               Book turns, grins with some pride of accomplishment!

                                     BOOK
                         Won him over just like that.

                                     RACHEL
                         I see.
                              (and)
                         But I hope you have a lot of sugar.
                              (then, going)
                         Eli is ready to go to Zook's.

               Just then Luke skitters impatiently... Book gives him a 
               nervous look; one last tentative pat as Luke eyes him 
               skeptically, then closes the stall gate and turns to go:

                                     BOOK
                         Later.

               And we...

               EXT. ZOOK FARM  LANCASTER COUNTY  DAY

               BIG SHOT... it's early morning as the Amish buggies are 
               arriving at the Zook farm for a barn-raising.

               In the b.g. we can see big stacks of lumber all around the 
               construction site where a couple of dozen men have begun 
               raising the main supports on the already laid foundation.

               Elsewhere, long tables have been set up and women are 
               spreading them with cloths, setting out big tanks of hot 
               coffee and cold lemonade for the men,

               LAPP BUGGY

               As Eli, Book, Rachel and Samuel step down, Book eyes the 
               construction site.

                                     ELI
                         Wait here 'til I find a gang you can 
                         work with.

               He goes. Book glances around as even more buggies arrive and 
               more workmen and their families climb out.

               Eli appears with Hochstetler in tow. Hochstetler's broad 
               face breaks into a grin:

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         Book! Good to see you!

               He pumps Book's hand with his usual vigor, smiling a greeting 
               and pleasantry to Rachel. She looks on, amused.

               Hochstetler gives Rachel a look, and we realize that his 
               showing up just now to appropriate Book was no happenstance.

               And Book realizes it as well.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.

                                     BOOK
                         It's been a while.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         No matter. Come with me. We can always 
                         use a good carpenter.

               With that he throws a huge arm around Book's shoulder and 
               ushers him away. Rachel calls after them:

                                     RACHEL
                         Good luck.

               BOOK / HOCHSTETLER

               As they move off.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         Your hole is healed, then?

                                     BOOK
                              (gives him a look)
                         Pretty much.

               Hochstetler nods with satisfaction:

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         Good. Then you can go home.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               CUTS

               As the morning progresses:

               ...Book and Hochstetler sawing and augering out heavy timbers 
               on big sawhorses. There's an unmistakable atmosphere of 
               competition between the two men, which doesn't go entirely 
               unnoticed by the half-dozen or so other young men on the 
               gang.

               ...or, indeed, by Rachel; in fact, she seems  without leaning 
               on it too heavily  to be measuring the two men as the morning 
               progresses, and she occasionally passes within proximity of 
               them.

               ...Eli and a couple of other elders prowling the job with 
               sheaves of hand-drawn sketches under their arms, supervising 
               the construction. All around them the structure is rising 
               with remarkable rapidity.

               ...Rachel, where she's helping the women set out the huge 
               noon meal. Other women are sitting on benches in the b.g., 
               knitting or doing quiltwork.

               ...Samuel, where he's banging away with a hammer, with a 
               group of boys his own age. Elsewhere we see little girls 
               "botching" (a hand-clapping game played to German rhymes).

               ...The very elderly; sitting on the grass or in wheelchairs 
               in the sunlight, looking on  the old men kibitzing in German, 
               the women gossiping.

               Until...

               BIG SHOT

               Of the barn-raising with the noon sun high overhead... at 
               least a hundred and fifty men are swarming over and about 
               the barn framework...

               ...some aid the rafters, some hauling lumber to the job, 
               others sawing, hammering, drilling, joining, planing and 
               what-all... so many that the barn seems almost to be rearing 
               up before our very eyes. And there isn't a power tool in 
               sight.

               WOMEN'S AREA

               As Rachel crosses near the benches... we can see other women 
               eyeing her, whispering among themselves, some tittering. 
               Rachel ignores them.

               She joins the stoutly amiable Mrs. Yoder from the funeral 
               sequence earlier. The older woman is emptying a big pan of 
               fried chicken into serving platters. She smiles, obviously 
               liking Rachel.

                                     MRS. YODER
                         Everyone has an idea about you and 
                         the English.

                                     RACHEL
                         All of them charitable, I'm sure.

                                     MRS. YODER
                         Hardly any of them.

               ANGLE  THE ROOFBEAM

               Book and Hochstetler astride the roofbeam studs, holding 
               them together prior to nailing them to the roof-beam. They 
               are, therefore, crotch to the mast and facing one another, 
               way out at the far end of the roof.

               Suddenly, as Hochstetler raises his hammer, the studs start 
               to part, threatening to de-ball the both of them.

               Hochstetler drops his hammer, grabs both sides of the roof 
               with incredible brute strength, and, literally, pulls it 
               back together.

               Book stares at Hochstetler with nothing short of awe.

               Hochstetler, straining and grinning, looks to Book:

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         Nail it!

                                     BOOK
                         Yes, sir.

               And he does nail it while Hochstetler, grinning and holding, 
               looks on.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               BIG SHOT

               The barn is done, the workmen climbing down from the rafters. 
               It's late afternoon.

               ANGLE ON BOOK

               He hesitates. His face is pale and covered with sweat. The 
               exertion of the day has taken its toll. He's in danger of 
               fainting and is some forty feet above the ground. But he's 
               determined it won't happen, determined that he won't fall, 
               nor will he humiliate himself by calling for help. Hochstetler 
               guesses the situation. He moves beside Book, claps an arm 
               about him, says nothing, doesn't even look at Book. From 
               below, someone TELLS them to hurry up.

               Hochstetler shouts:

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         We admire our work!

               The moment passes for Book, and he's okay. Hochstetler removes 
               his supporting arm. Book looks him in the eye, nods his 
               appreciation almost imperceptibly. Hochstetler wants no 
               thanks, and Book knows it. Hochstetler gives him a resounding 
               SLAP on the back, and starts climbing down. Book follows.

               EXT. ZOOK FARM  LANCASTER COUNTY  EVENING

               The gathering has congregated to hear Bishop Tschantz offer 
               up a blessing on the new barn.

               CONGREGATION

               PANNING the faces as they listen to the heavy German words 
               rolling out over the still evening air.

               Book stands a little to one side of the Amish. The prayers 
               he cannot share with them. Rachel is aware of this, feels 
               something of his emotion. She looks toward him, then she too 
               closes her eyes and drifts away from him, into the soothing 
               prayer.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LAPP FARM  NIGHT

               Book stands outside, listening to the NIGHT SOUNDS. He turns, 
               walks up toward the porch.

               EXT. PORCH  TARP FARMHOUSE  NIGHT

               Book takes a seat in a chair, SIGHS, looks toward the night 
               sky.

               There is a SOUND, but it's a moment before he turns his eyes 
               toward the door.

               ANGLE  THE DOOR

               Samuel standing there in his nightshirt.

               BACK TO SCENE

               As Book leans forward in his chair.

                                     BOOK
                         Hey, Sam...

                                     SAMUEL
                         ...I want to say a thing.

                                     BOOK
                              (sitting up)
                         What's that, Sam?

               The boy hesitates, holds for a time, then suddenly darts 
               across to Book, wraps his arms around him, hugs him tightly... 
               then breaks away, turns and runs hack into the house, leaving 
               the door open behind him.

               ANGLE  BOOK

               Looking after the boy, genuinely moved. After a moment, he 
               speaks softly:

                                     BOOK
                         Same to you, Sam.

               After another moment, he gets up, moves to close the door 
               that Samuel has left open behind him.

               ANOTHER ANGLE  BOOK

               From the lighted/shadowed area outside the door. He comes to 
               the door, starts to close it, then hesitates, looks into see 
               where the light is coming from. He looks down the corridor. 
               The light is obviously coming from the kitchen. He speaks 
               softly:

                                     BOOK
                         Sam?

               No answer. Book steps inside, pulls the door shut behind 
               him, moves down-the corridor toward the kitchen.

               INT. LAPP WASHHOUSE  NIGHT

               Where Rachel, dressed only in a plain cotton camisole, is 
               pouring a pail of steaming water into a tub.

               She replaces the pail on the stove, turns and slips out of 
               her camisole. Naked, she folds the garment across the back 
               of a chair.

               Then she pauses, containing a startled intake of breath.

               RACHEL'S POV  FRYING PAN

               The gleaming bottom of a large copper skillet hanging over 
               the stove with other cookware, we can see Book's image 
               reflected there, framed in the kitchen doorway.

               BACK TO SCENE

               Rachel hesitates for a moment  and in that moment she makes 
               a choice.

               Slowly she turns, to face him, without shame, meeting his 
               eyes.

               And for a moment she attempts something: a look, a flash of 
               eve... a lovely, heartbreakingly innocent effort to become, 
               for an instant, a woman of Book's world.

               BOOK

               As he stands in the doorway, willing himself to leave, unable 
               to make it happen.

               And suddenly the moment has passed. Rachel lowers her eyes, 
               picks up the camisole, covers herself with it without putting 
               it on, looks away.

               BOOK

               TIGHTENING to him, and...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               REESTABLISHING...

               ANGLE  HEN YARD

               Where Rachel is scattering feed to the chickens.

               A beat, then Book approaches from behind her. A moment, as 
               she senses his presence.

               Book watches as Rachel begins to gather the eggs, placing 
               them in the fold of her apron.

               When he speaks, he speaks softly, and she pauses in her work.

                                     BOOK
                         Last night.

               She goes very still, but keeps her back to him.

                         If... we'd made love, then, I couldn't 
                         leave.

               She lowers her head slightly, but remains turned away from 
               him.

               Book continues to stare at her.

               EXT. RURAL ROAD  LANCASTER COUNTY  DAY

               The Lapp carriage on a winding lane.

               INT. BUGGY (MOVING)

               Rachel is driving, Book sitting next to her. Samuel is in 
               the back, looking out the rear window and not paying any 
               attention to the adults.

               A beat, then a large produce truck roars past them. It's all 
               Book can do to keep from flinching.

               Rachel stares straight ahead. Book glances at her.

                                     BOOK
                         Maybe I ought to learn to drive this 
                         thing.

               Rachel says nothing.

                                     BOOK
                              (beat)
                         Pick myself up another useful skill.

               Now Rachel can't help but smile. She looks at him. And...

               EXT. ANGLE

               We can see the Lapp buggy approaching a rural intersection, 
               another buggy approaching at right angles.

               INT. LAPP BUGGY

               As Rachel eyes the other buggy through the windshield.

                                     RACHEL
                         Samuel, who is that?

               Samuel checks out the buggy.

                                     SAMUEL
                         It looks like Hochstetler's mare.

               EXT. ANGLE

               As the Lapp buggy passes the intersection and the Hochstetler 
               buggy swings in behind them. Then the Hochstetler buggy, 
               coming on at a faster clip, starts to pass the Lapp buggy.

               INT. LAPP BUGGY

               As Rachel waves at the occupants of the other buggy; Daniel 
               returns her greeting:

                                     BOOK
                              (teasing her)
                         Uh oh, they're leaving us behind.

               Rachel gives him a look, and... gives the reins a flick  
               the race is on.

               RACE MONTAGE

               Hochstetler has a couple of older folk on board, together 
               with his young sister  at first they're not aware of the 
               race, until Daniel can contain his excitement no longer and 
               gives his horse a couple of whoops. The buggies are neck and 
               neck, and the older people are not protesting loudly.

               It's all Book can do to refrain from grabbing the reins off 
               Rachel, but she's something of a horsewoman and finally she 
               gains the edge and pulls ahead of Hochstetler, to the cheers 
               of Samuel and Book.

               EXT. SALZBURGSTORE  DAY

               It's a Saturday afternoon in the tourist season, and they're 
               everywhere  taking shots of anything Amish. There's a ROWDY 
               YOUNG ELEMENT amongst them who are making their presence 
               fast, and generally making a nuisance of themselves.

               Book and Rachel get out of the buggy. Samuel stays inside; 
               the crowds make him nervous. A huge tourist bus billowing 
               smoke pulls up nearby.

               Rachel enters the store, but before Book can follow he's 
               stopped by a TOURIST LADY with an instamatic camera... She 
               waggles the camera at him...

                                     TOURIST LADY
                         Could I... ah, you know?

                                     BOOK
                              (smiling)
                         Lady, if you take my picture, I'll 
                         rip your brassiere off and strangle 
                         you with it.

               The Tourist Lady stares at him in stunned disbelief, her 
               grin frozen on her face. Then she begins to scuttle back 
               from whence she came.

               INT. STORE

               Rachel is browsing among the stocked shelves in the company 
               of a young Amish woman, Ellie Beiler. Rachel is carrying 
               Ellie's tiny baby, and the infant is getting as much attention 
               as the shopping.

               Book is standing at a wall pay phone in the b.g. We TIGHTEN 
               to him, and...

                                     BOOK
                         Lieutenant Elton Carter, please.

               A beat, then we hear the FILTERED VOICE of the Philadelphia 
               Police Department switchboard:

                                     VOICE

                                     VOICE
                         I'm sorry. Last night Sergeant Carter 
                         was killed in the line of duty...

               Book hangs up. His breathing is thrown out by the shock of 
               the news and he takes a couple of deep breaths to regain 
               control. He hesitates, unsure of his next move. He makes to 
               move away, then he turns back, finds more coins and dials a 
               second number.

               INT. HALLWAY, SCHAEFFER'S HOME  DAY

               Schaeffer's wife answers the phone; she is momentarily 
               shocked.

               She calls for her husband, then makes polite conversation.

                         How are you, John?

               Paul Schaeffer appears, slightly irritated at being called 
               away from the Saturday afternoon game.

                                     MRS. SCHAEFFER

               Schaeffer takes the phone.

                         You can hang up, dear.

               We HEAR the click of the other phone,

               Book hangs up the phone and the dead CLICK registers on 
               Schaeffer.

               Book has gripped the phone so tightly that it takes a second 
               to unclench his fist. Then it takes something else to resist 
               his first impulse, which is to smash out at something... 
               Training. Get it under control. Deal rationally with the 
               situation.

               He straightens his jacket, wipes the sweat/tears from his 
               eyes, turns and walks stiffly out of the Saltzburg General 
               Store.

               INT. BUGGY  MAIN STREET  SALTZBURG  DAY

               Book, as Rachel eyes him. She has noticed his changed mood, 
               but doesn't ask about it. He stares straight ahead, oblivious 
               to the surroundings of the street, now crawling with tourists 
               and traffic.

               EXT. NARROW SIDE STREET  SALTZBURG  DAY

               The buggy turns into the side street. Some hundred yards 
               ahead another buggy is stopped in the middle of the road  
               several youths gathered about it. A pickup truck is stopped, 
               facing the buggy.

               INT. LAPP BUGGY  DAY

               As Rachel approaches the scene, slowing down and finally 
               stopping.

               Rachel is at first puzzled, then makes a small face, looks 
               at Book.

               Rachel puts a restraining hand on Book's arm.

                                     RACHEL
                         Do nothing. This happens from time 
                         to time.

               She senses him about to get out, grips his arm tightly.

                                     RACHEL
                         It's not our way, John. We'll have 
                         nothing to do with violence! John!

               Book shakes free, gets out and slowly walks toward the...

               EXT. HOCHSTETLER'S BUGGY  DAY

               Hochstetler and his family sit, impassive, ignoring various 
               jeers and taunts from the English lads  various jokes about 
               them being dirty etc. One jabs an ice cream cone into 
               Hochstetler's forehead, which leaves a curious white circle 
               on his forehead. Another fools about with the horse causing 
               it to shy. A third notices the slow, sure, approach of John 
               Book.

                                     YOUTH
                         Here comes another one!

               Book stops, his path blocked by the third youth. The youth 
               flicks off Book's hat.

                                     BOOK
                              (quietly)
                         You're making a mistake.

               Hochstetler calls from his buggy.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         Everything is all right, John.

                                     BOOK
                              (to the youth)
                         Pick up the hat.

               The youth momentarily unsure  something about Book's tone 
               of voice. The youth does pick up the hat, crumples it, stamps 
               on it, and puts it back at a crazy angle on Book's head. A 
               pause, then Book explodes.

               The kid never knew what hit him or where it came from, he 
               hits the road surface already unconscious. A second youth 
               grabs Book from behind. A mistake. Book is smashing into 
               him, spatters of blood from his nose flying in all directions. 
               He's hitting too hard, too often. It's Schaeffer he's hitting. 
               Hochstetler is pulling him away, Rachel is there too. A crowd 
               is gathering, but as suddenly as it began it's over. Book 
               shakes Hochstetler off him, straightens his hat, and in a 
               kind of daze, begins walking past the scene in the direction 
               of the Lapp farm.

               The youths are picking up their wounded, helping them back 
               to their truck, aided by none other than Hochstetler. An OLD 
               LOCAL addresses Rachel.

                                     RACHEL
                         Yes. Samuel! We're going.

               A second man calls from the pickup.

                                     SECOND MAN
                         Kid's nose is broken!

                                     LOCAL MAN
                         We'll take him up the hospital. Good-
                         day to you, Mrs. Lapp.
                              (he shouts after her)
                         This ain't good for the tourist trade, 
                         you know! You tell that to your Ohio 
                         cousin!

               But Rachel is already steering past the scene and following 
               the by now distant figure of John Book.

               EXT. BARN / CARPENTER'S SHOP  DUSK

               Book comes out of the carpenter's shop carrying the repaired 
               birdhouse on its pole in one hand, a shovel in the other.

               Rachel is shepherding the milking cows toward the barn.

                                     RACHEL
                         You should not bother with that 
                         birdhouse.
                              (a beat)
                         If you're leaving tomorrow.

                                     BOOK
                         I'm leaving tonight.
                              (and)
                         I'm going to need my clothes. And my 
                         gun.

               She nods, looks away... looks back at him twice in glances. 
               There is a moment when it appears she might either bark at 
               him or begin to weep. He waits. When she does turn to him, 
               she speaks softly:

                                     RACHEL
                         There was a time when I thought you 
                         might have stayed.

                                     BOOK
                              (hesitating... then)
                         There was.

                                     RACHEL
                         There was a time when I would have 
                         welcomed it.

                                     BOOK
                              (after a beat)
                         I know.

                                     RACHEL
                              (asking)
                         I was being foolish?

                                     BOOK
                         No.
                              (and)
                         I was being unrealistic. Even thinking 
                         about living this life.

                                     RACHEL
                         You're so sure of that?

                                     BOOK
                         Aren't you? After today?

                                     RACHEL
                              (almost conceding it, 
                              but... her voice 
                              rising a bit, annoyed)
                         I'm not so sure of anything as you 
                         are, John Book. You could live this 
                         life if you wanted to bad enough.
                              (a beat)
                         Just as I could live yours!

                                     BOOK
                              (almost groaning)
                         Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.

                                     RACHEL
                         There is always a way! But you are 
                         such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot 
                         see! You'd rather go back to that 
                         city! To nothing! No woman! No 
                         children! No land!

                                     BOOK
                              (now getting annoyed)
                         Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman 
                         and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's 
                         what I know and that's what I do!

                                     RACHEL
                         What you do is take vengeance! Which 
                         is a sin against heaven!

                                     BOOK
                         That's your way, not mine.

                                     RACHEL
                         That's God's way!

                                     BOOK
                         Well in the City of Philadelphia, 
                         God needs a little help!

               He has offended her, immediately knows it, but can't bring 
               himself to make an instant apology. But he's chewing on it 
               when she takes the moment unto herself. She pulls herself 
               up, speaks with great dignity:

                                     RACHEL
                         I could never love a man who was 
                         so... little.

               He looks at her, sad-eyed, his anger ebbing and gone, 
               realizing that he'll never meet a finer woman... never even 
               get close to such a one. He appears to start to speak, but 
               then does not.

               She turns, moves away a few steps, stops, looks back at him. 
               she holds for a moment, blinking tears, then speaks with 
               some difficulty, emotion welling in her words.

                                     RACHEL
                         The other night... when you saw me 
                         after my bath... I... I tried to 
                         look as I thought you would want a 
                         woman to look.
                              (sadly... but with a 
                              slight, proud lift 
                              of chin)
                         I am sorry... that I did not.

               She holds for an instant, then turns and walks off.

               BOOK

               Looking after her. A face full of loss.

               INT. KITCHEN  DUSK

               Eli is lighting the lamps. Samuel reads a book at the kitchen 
               table. Rachel moves slowly to the sink and begins washing a 
               few dishes. She looks out the window.

               CLOSE on her face, a strange expression.

               INT. / EXT RACHEL'S POV  DUSK

               The distant figure of Book working on the birdhouse.

               INT. KITCHEN

               CLOSE on Rachel's hands, lifting items slowly up and of the 
               water to the draining board, where she places them carefully 
               down. She shakes the water off her hands.

               CLOSE on her face, still staring fixedly out the window. She 
               speaks without turning around.

                                     RACHEL
                         Eli, would you see Samuel to bed?

               The old man glances at her; this is not their routine.

               EXT. DRIVEWAY  DUSK

               In the rapidly fading light, Rachel walks slowly toward Book.

               CLOSE on her face, staring straight ahead toward Book.

               ANGLE on Book, CLOSE. He turns and watches Rachel's approach.

               BIG WIDE ANGLE

               The light now nearly gone, the NIGHT SOUNDS beginning, as 
               Rachel reaches Book and they embrace.

               EXT. FIELD BY ROAD  NIGHT

               Book and Rachel in a passionate embrace, sink to the still 
               warm earth and make love.

               EXT. SOUDERSBURG CAFE  LANCASTER COUNTY  NIGHT

               ESTABLISHING an all-night cafe in the early hours of the 
               morning.

               TIGHTENING to the bleakly lighted windows.

               INT. CARE

               A booth, where Schaeffer and McElroy and Fergie, a Lancaster 
               County Undersheriff and his SHERIFF  an expansive politician 
               type  are seated.

               The Undersheriff eyes Schaeffer narrowly. The Sheriff has a 
               county map spread out on the table, amid breakfast dishes, 
               pointing directions to Schaeffer:

                                     SHERIFF
                         There... White Oak Road a couple of 
                         miles before it ties into two-twenty-
                         two. Got it?

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Got it. We owe you one, Sheriff.

                                     SHERIFF
                         My man Holmes here put it together. 
                         Fine officer, Chief. He spoke to the 
                         doctor at the hospital.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Undersheriff Holmes and I have talked 
                         on the phone.
                              (nods at Holmes)
                         Good work.

                                     UNDERSHERIFF
                         Sure you don't want us to post some 
                         backup units?

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         If we need any help, we'll give you 
                         a shout. I'd like to slip in there 
                         quiet, then get out before we attract 
                         any attention.

               EXT. CAFE PORCH  DAY

               As Schaeffer and his men are climbing into their car. Holmes 
               and the Sheriff watch after them.

                                     HOLMES
                         Maybe I'll take a drive over that 
                         way.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Let 'em be. It's their dirty laundry.

               But Holmes pauses to watch Schaeffer's car pull out.

               EXT. RURAL LANE  LANCASTER COUNTY  DAWN

               With the first light of dawn on the eastern horizon, 
               Schaeffer's car approaches along the lane, pulls into the 
               Lapp driveway and comes to a halt.

               In the b.g. we can make out the farmhouse and outbuildings.

               HOLD as Schaeffer, McElroy and Fergie step out of the car. 
               They break out short-barreled twelve-gauge pumps, start TOWARD 
               CAMERA, spreading out as they turn up the long driveway... 
               figures of ominous intent striding through the misty dawn.

               ANGLE

               GOING WITH the trio of gunmen... McElroy, breath smoking in 
               the chill, eyes the terrain:

                                     MCELROY
                         Weird, man. No fuckin' electricity. 
                         What do you figure they plug all 
                         their shit into?

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         They don't have any shit.

               INT. KITCHEN  DAWN

               Where Eli is getting into a heavy coat, preparing to go out... 
               the remains of the hearty morning breakfast are on the table. 
               Rachel is beginning the dishes.

               INT. BARN  DAWN

               Book and Samuel are starting the morning milking...

               INT. KITCHEN  DAWN

               Eli is preparing to extinguish the lamp when suddenly the 
               kitchen door is kicked open and McElroy and Fergie weapons 
               leveled, burst in. Eli reacts with angry shock as Schaeffer 
               enters: Rachel is, for a moment, terrified.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (to Fergie)
                         Outside 
                              (to Mac)
                         Check out the rest of the house.

               He turns to Eli, who is standing in the middle of the room.

               Schaeffer flashes his badge:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         We're police officers. We're looking 
                         for a fugitive, John Book. He's living 
                         here?

                                     ELI
                         I have nothing to say to you. Get 
                         out of my house!

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You speak English. Good. Now listen 
                         

                                     RACHEL
                              (recovering)
                         No, you listen. Get out!

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Lady, I'm here to help you. This man 
                         is very dangerous. An armed criminal.
                              (ingratiating)
                         He's got a gun, hasn't he?

                                     RACHEL
                         You have no right here!

               McElroy re-enters.

                                     MCELROY
                         He's not in this building.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (to Eli)
                         All right, where is he?

               Suddenly Eli SHOUTS: It's deafening. Probably the loudest 
               noise Eli has ever made:

                                     ELI
                         John Book!

               McElroy whips around, smashes Eli on the temple with the 
               butt of his shotgun. Eli crumples to the floor. Rachel 
               SCREAMS, runs to Eli.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               Book and Samuel in the milkhouse. They've heard Eli's outcry. 
               Book moves to the window, looks out.

               BOOK'S POV  FERGIE

               About halfway between the barn and the house. He turns from 
               glancing back toward the house (having heard Eli's shout) 
               and starts again toward the barn. Gun at the ready.

                         watch these two.

               McElroy nods, moves outside, turns toward the barns.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               Book still at the window, Samuel now beside him, trying to 
               get a look.

                                     SAMUEL
                         Is it them?

                              (he bends to the boy, 
                              takes him by the

                         Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to 
                         me carefully. Listen to me as you 
                         never listened before.

                                     SAMUEL
                              (interrupting)
                         Are they going to kill you?

                         across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. 
                         Run as fast as you can. And stay 
                         there!

                                     SAMUEL
                         What are you going to do?

                         say.

               He takes Samuel by the hand, leads him to the side door. He 
               bends, holds the boy close.

                                     SAMUEL

               Fergie almost to the upper barn, McElroy  well back and 
               moving slowly, circumspectly  headed toward the lower barn.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               Book, at another window in the lower barn, sees McElroy 
               heading for the milkhouse door. He can't see Fergie. He turns, 
               crosses the cowpen area, climbs an inner ladder leading to 
               the upper barn.

               EXT. BARN  DAY

               Fergie at the door to the upper barn, moving very cautiously, 
               gun up. He eases around the doorpost, looks within.

               INT. BARN  ANGLE PAST BOOK

               Beyond Book, now at the top of the ladder, we see Fergie 
               easing into the barn. Book pulls himself up, crawls behind 
               the wall of the mule stalls, opens gate, eases in beside 
               Luke, urgently whispering and patting the animal to calm 
               him. He gets to the animal's head, crouches, strokes Luke's 
               nose. The mule's huge flanks quiver, his nostril's and eyes 
               widen, but he makes no untoward sound. Book closes the gate.

               BACK TO FERGIE

               He comes on warily, muzzle first, eyes darting.

               DOLLYING WITH him as he reaches the first mule's stall, opens 
               the gate. An edgy mule turns, eyes him, shuffles nervously. 
               Fergie backs off, moves on.

               BOOK

               As he listens, tenses, hearing Fergie's feet in the fresh 
               straw.

               Book eases back alongside Luke, waits.

               BACK TO FERGIE

               As he approaches Luke's stall, reaches for the gate-latch.

               BOOK  FLASH CUT

               As the gate swings open, Book shouts and gives Luke a whack 
               on the back. The mule's pent-up nerves and feral energy 
               explode in an horrendous SCREAM.

               FERGIE

               Bowled backwards by the rearing animal as the gate flies 
               open, involuntarily FIRING, suddenly finding himself under 
               the lethal hooves of a twelve-hundred pound beast. Staggering 
               backwards, he SCREAMS, FIRES again, the load striking the 
               mule in its heaving chest as a flailing hoof smashes into 
               Fergie's head and the other hoof snaps his shotgun in half 
               like a matchstick.

               BOOK

               As he slips out of the stall, ducks toward the rear of the 
               barn.

               FERGIE

               Fallen, skull smashed... and now the dying Luke's legs buckle 
               and he collapses atop Fergie.

               EXT. BARN  DAY

               McElroy standing still, shock-eyed, looking toward the sound 
               of the shots. Then starting slowly forward.

               Some distance from the barn, Samuel's hearing the shots, 
               stops dead in his tracks... the sound of the shots still 
               REVERBERATING across the quiet fields.

                                     SAMUEL
                              (stricken)
                         Mr. Book?

               He hesitates, then turns, starts trotting back toward the 
               barns.

               EXT. / INT. KITCHEN PORCH  DAY

               Rachel has moved into the open kitchen door, glances anxiously 
               toward the barns. Starts out. Schaeffer pushes her back.

               McElroy flattens himself against the wall, looks around 
               fearfully.

                                     MCELROY
                              (softly)

                         What the hell happened?

               He listens, hears nothing, snorts, starts toward the barn 
               checking his gun, not hurrying.

               Samuel running as fast as he can trips as he crosses a small 
               muddy stream, falls full length, scrambles up, runs on.

               McElroy, moving very cautiously, comes around the mule stalls, 
               stops short, stares off screen.

               HIS POV  FERGIE

               Where he lies half buried beneath the huge bulk of the mule, 
               his head crushed like an eggshell.

               BACK TO MCELROY

               As he moves on around Fergie and the dead mule, planting 
               each foot as if he were walking in a mine field.

               BOOK

               Standing in shadow at the back of the barn next to a hay 
               mow.

               HIS POV  MCELROY

               Moving toward the center of the barn.

               BOOK

               As he starts to move even further back, he nudges into a 
               rope fastened to the wall behind him, He looks at it, looks 
               up.

               HIS POV  THE ROPE

               It runs from where it is fastened to the wall straight up to 
               the center roofbeam of the barn to a trolley fixed to a track 
               that runs the length of the roofbeam. Attached to this trolley 
               is a big hayfork (Paul Krantz has one), U-shaped, sharply-
               pointed at each end of the U. the points hanging toward the 
               floor. The thing weighs about eighty pounds, and is suspended 
               in place by the rope anchored at the wall next to Book.

               BACK TO BOOK

               Keeping one eye on McElroy, he carefully begins to un-tie 
               the trip rope.

               MCELROY

               Moving out toward the center of the barn, almost under the 
               suspended hay fork. He stops short, listens. Then, either 
               spotting a moving shadow or hearing a SOUND, he FIRES. His 
               shot rattles off the side of a manure spreader. He SHOUTS:

                                     MCELROY
                         Book, you sneaky bastard, I know 
                         you're here! Come out and fight!

               EXT. BARNYARD  DAY

               Samuel, at the top of the barnyard, stops at the SOUND OF 
               THE SHOT, wide-eyed. He listens for an-instant, starts a 
               step toward the barn, then stops again, looks to a large 
               bell suspended in a cupola by one of the outbuildings. He 
               moves quickly to the bell, seizes the rope, pulls. The bell 
               CLANGS loudly, Sonorously.

               SCHAEFFER

               On the front porch, looking around for the location of the 
               sounding bell. He takes a step toward the barn, the stops, 
               looks back toward the house... frustrated.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               Book watches as McElroy starts to move again looking back 
               toward the SOUNDING of the bell.

               HIGH ANGLE  HAY FORK

               Looking down we can see McElroy almost directly beneath the 
               hay fork. The bell SOUNDING throughout. BOOK Waiting... trip 
               rope in hand. Then:

                                     BOOK
                              (shouting)
                         Hey, Mac!

               And he lets go the trip rope.

               MCELROY

               As he turns toward the SOUND of Book's voice.

               HAY FORK

               As it plummets down, causing a RATCHETING SOUND that fills 
               the barn, even drowns out the SOUND of the bell.

               MCELROY

               Eyes darting wildly, looking up.

               HIS POV  HAY FORK

               Plunging straight for him.

               MCELROY

               Diving to one side.

               ANGLE  HAY FORK

               THUDDING into the barn floor like a great trident fork.

               Quivering there, not a foot from McElroy's head.

               MCELROY

               Staring at the fork pop-eyed.

               BOOK

               Sprinting toward a ladder thrust up through an opening in 
               the barn floor just in front of his parked car.

               MCELROY

               Spotting Book, coming up to one knee, quick-aiming, FIRING. 
               The shot smashes the windshield of the car.

               BOOK

               Diving, rolling, slamming into the top of the ladder, flailing 
               down out of sight.

               MCELROY

               FIRING AGAIN, then again. Emptying the gun, cursing as he 
               begins to reload, gets to his feet, starts toward the ladder. 
               The BELL still SOUNDING outside. The hood of the car SLOWLY 
               POPS UP.

               ANGLE

               As McElroy wheels at the movement of the car's hood, FIRES 
               twice.

               MCELROY'S POV  LAPP BUGGY

               The buckshot virtually blows the dashboard off.

               EXT. BARNYARD  DAY

               Samuel RINGING the bell. The bell rope is short, and so is 
               Samuel and his feet go off the ground with every swing of 
               the rockerarm.

               He hangs on grimly, his black hat clinging to the back of 
               his head, his face set against the tears that move down his 
               cheeks.

               SCHAEFFER

               Comes hesitantly down the path toward the barn, looking toward 
               the sound of the bell, but also looking back in glances toward 
               the house to make sure Rachel and Eli stay where they are. 
               He still can't see Samuel.

               HIS POV  THE PORCH

               As Rachel starts off the porch, takes a few steps.

               SCHAEFFER

               Turning, SHOUTING:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You stay put!

               RACHEL

               She stops. She is also unable to see Samuel.

               SCHAEFFER

               Moving out toward the barn, rounding a corner... and there 
               is Samuel at the bellrope. He starts toward him.

               EXT. FIELDS  DAY

               Beyond Samuel, well out in the fields of the Stoltzfus farm, 
               Stotlzfus and others  including Hochstetler and his brothers 
                are baling the first cutting of June hay.

               But the operation has come to a halt. All are looking in 
               toward the Lapp farm, hearing the RINGING OF THE BELL (the 
               Amish cry for help), wondering, hesitating.

               But now, as we watch, led by Hochstetler, they start in toward 
               Samuel.

               EXT. BARNYARD  DAY

               As Schaeffer reaches Samuel, SHOUTS:

                         Cut that out!

               Samuel looks at him, keeps on pulling.

               Schaeffer quickly crosses to him, grabs him by the back of 
               the neck, tries to pull him off the bell rope. Samuel hangs 
               on grimly.

               Schaeffer yanks hard, succeeds in yanking Samuel free, shoves 
               him roughly aside. Then Schaeffer turns, FIRES a shotgun 
               blast into the top of the bellrope. It still hangs by several 
               threads, so he FIRES again.

               The rope drops to the ground. Schaeffer reloads, turns to 
               look at Samuel, just getting to his feet. A moment... when 
               Schaeffer, recognizing Samuel as the Amish kid who saw McElroy 
               kill Zenovich, perhaps thinks of disposing of the witness 
               right then and there.

               But a glance toward the oncoming Amish gives him pause. He 
               SNARLS at Sam:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Get down to the house and stay there!

               Samuel gets to his feet, turns, trots off.

               RACHEL

               Already halfway out to the barn, running to gather Sam in 
               her arms... then to lead him back toward the house.

               SCHAEFFER

               Turning, starting very slowly toward the barn.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               McElroy at the top of the ladder, looking down. Then easing 
               over, placing his feet on the rungs.

               BOOK

               He stands below in a cowpen, using the cows for cover. The 
               cows stare balefully at him. A large goat nuzzles him, hooks 
               at him with its horns. Book waits, watches.

               HIS POV  MCELROY

               Visible to his knees as he eases down the ladder. He stops 
               at every rung to scrape his shoes free of the cowshit covering 
               the rungs.

               BACK TO BOOK

               He turns now to a door at the back of the pen. He un-hooks 
               it, pulls it open, moves inside.

               ANOTHER ANGLE  BOOK

               He is now in a small passageway giving on to the entrance to 
               a nearly-empty silo. Above the entrance, a ladder (interior) 
               rises to the top of the structure.

               Book looks in, and up. We should get the impression that 
               Book's been here before, expects what he sees.

               WHAT HE SEES

               Forty feet up, a patch of blue sky through an open hatch.

               BACK TO BOOK

               He steps through to the base of the ladder, then ducks beyond 
               it into the silo. There is about two feet of old silage 
               covering the floor. He turns, looks up the white walls.

               HIS POV  INSIDE SILO

               An inside ladder runs to the top.

               HIS POV  KICKBOARD

               Standing against the wall next to the entrance... . obviously 
               to be inserted as the silo is filled.

               BOOK

               Now, quickly, he ducks back out through the entrance, crosses 
               to the door to the cowpen, very cautiously peers out..

               WHAT HE SEES

               McElroy at the bottom of the ladder, looking in the other 
               direction (toward the milkhouse).

               BACK TO BOOK

               Very carefully he shoves the cowpen door (which opens outward 
               into the cowpen). It begins to swing very slowly open. Book 
               immediately turns, darts back into the silo.

               MCELROY

               Turning slowly toward the cowpen... then FIRES twice as his 
               eye catches the motion of the swinging door. His shots blow 
               half a row of Eli's precious tools off an adjacent wall. 
               McElroy reloads, starts across toward the door.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Old Eli, at the sight of Samuel, rises from the table.

                                     ELI
                         Praise Gott!

               Rachel stands aside as the old man embraces Samuel long and 
               hard.

               She watches as he turns to the cupboard, takes down the big 
               family Bible. He crosses to the table, sets the book down, 
               places his hand on its pulls Samuel to the table beside him.

               Rachel holds another beat as she stares at the old man 
               helplessly, then she rushes to where she hid Book's gun, 
               takes it down... her trembling hands take the bullets out of 
               the coffee jar. She drops several as she tries to figure out 
               how to open the chamber to load it.

               In the b.g., Eli glances up, sees what she is about... he 
               rises and crosses to her. Samuel watches from the table.

                                     ELI
                              (fiercely)
                         No, Rachel...

                                     RACHEL
                         I have to help him!

               Rachel somehow manages to open the chamber and begins to try 
               to load the bullets. Eli's callused hand closes over hers, 
               halting the action:

                                     ELI
                         It is not our way!

               Bullets are already CLATTERING to the floor from her trembling 
               fingers as she raises her eyes to Eli's.

               A long beat as Rachel looks at him... Finally her fingers 
               release the pistol and it CLATTERS to the floor. She closes 
               her eyes.

               Samuel, who has gotten up, moved to a window, watches Eli 
               and Rachel silently.

               Eli leads her to the table, places her hands on the Bible 
               beneath his. They stand there and they pray.

               INT. SILO  DAY

               Book finishes putting the kickboard into the entrance.

               MCELROY

               Moving among the cows, stepping cautiously between the 
               cowflops.

               The goat nudges him once, then butts him rather firmly. 
               McElroy swats at him with the gun butt, moves to the door. 
               As he arrives, he HEARS a noise  very slight  from the 
               direction of the silo.

               He enters the passage way, looks in toward the silo entrance, 
               He hesitates. Another slight noise. He steps in to the base 
               of the inner ladder, looks up.

               HIS POV  THE HATCH

               The patch of blue sky, forty feet up.

               BACK TO MCELROY

               He frowns, reaches out, grabs a rung.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               Schaeffer, easing toward the mule stalls, MUTTERS, CURSES 
               under his breath. Then he rounds the corner of the first 
               stall... and there is Fergie with Luke the mule on top of 
               him. Schaeffer stares, blinks... moves on spotting a spent 
               shotgun shell near the hayfork...

               INT. SILO  DAY

               Book listening at the kickboard. SOUNDS of feet, shotgun 
               rattling against metal rungs, Book moves to the ladder on 
               his side, starts silently up.

               MCELROY

               Climbing with difficulty, shotgun clutched in one hand.

               BOOK

               He climbs up to the second kickboard, pauses, checks the 
               distance to the floor, starts upward again.

               BARN YARD  DAY

               The Amish beginning to arrive. Sam comes running, pulls 
               Stoltzfus toward the door of the milkhouse as the other Amish 
               look at the shot-shattered bellrope. Rachel and Eli come 
               rapidly up the path toward the group.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               Schaeffer finds another spent shotgun shell, crosses to the 
               ladder, looks down. He sets his shotgun down, takes out his 
               service revolver, starts down.

               INT. SILO  DAY

               Book has reaches the third kickboard, about thirty feet from 
               the ground. He checks it, turns the thumb-screws that hold 
               it in place, places his hand on the handle, moves to one 
               side as best he can... hangs there, listening.

               MCELROY

               Rattling up the other ladder, approaching the third kickboard.

               BOOK

               Listening tensely, hearing McElroy arrive on the other side 
               of the kickboard. Then, deliberately, Book makes a fist, 
               raps on the board smartly once.

               MCELROY

               Startled, REACTING. He sets his feet, leans back against the 
               back wall of the ladder well, brings the shotgun up, puts 
               the muzzle against the kickboard, clicks off the safety.

               BOOK

               We HEAR with him the thump of the muzzle, the CLICK... and, 
               with marvelous speed, Book pulls the kickboard and drops it 
               to the floor.

               McELROY  FLASH CUT Staring in, stun-eyed, already falling 
               forward (having leaned his weight on the shotgun) as Book 
               seizes the shotgun by the barrel, pulls inward.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As McElroy pitches forward through the opening, SCREAMS and 
               GRABS as he plunges past Book. The shotgun FIRES as McElroy 
               manages to hold onto Book, and both men plunge thirty feet 
               to the bottom of the silo.

               BOOK

               He falls almost straight down, lands on his back, lies 
               stunned.

               MCELROY

               His forward motion has carried him across the silo. His head 
               bounds off the white brick wall about five feet up... and he 
               falls in a heap, blood gushing from his head, as...

               TIGHT ON BOOK

               Blinking, groaning, just beginning to stir... and, suddenly, 
               into the frame comes a hand with a pistol in it. The muzzle 
               is placed firmly against Book's temple.

               WIDER

               Schaeffer holding the pistol. He cocks the pistol, tenses as 
               if to FIRE (and he is actually about to)... when there is a 
               SOUND behind him. He snaps around.

               WHAT HE SEES

               Old Stoltzfus and Samuel standing in the kickboard opening 
               (Schaeffer having kicked the kickboard in when he heard the 
               shot from within the silo). They stand solemnly, looking on 
               as:

               SCHAEFFER

               He eases the hammer down on this pistol, speaks softly:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Okay, Johnny. On your feet.

               THE SCENE

               As Book struggles to his feet  Schaeffer holding the pistol 
               tight to Book's head. Book turns, sees Samuel and Stoltzfus, 
               blinks.

               Schaeffer shoves Book toward the opening. As Book moves toward 
               Samuel, he speaks quietly:

                                     BOOK
                         It's okay, Sam.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As Book and McElroy move out of the silo, down the passageway 
               toward the milkhouse, Stoltzfus and Sam (after a glance in 
               at the inert McElroy) follow and...

               EXT. BARN  DAY

               As first Stoltzfus and Samuel, then Book and Schaeffer emerge 
               into the barnyard. Schaeffer has the muzzle of his pistol 
               pressed firmly against Book's throat, just below his jaw.

               Schaeffer pulls up, frowning:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Hold it.

               WHAT HE SEES

               The Amishmen gathered  the Stoltzfus family, the Hochstetler 
               brothers, et al. All staring hard at Schaeffer and Book.

               EXT. BARN / DRIVE  DAY

               From a high wide angle the final scene is played out. 
               Schaeffer and Book, now moving again slowly up the drive, 
               the Amish following along closely on both sides.

               CLOSE ON BOOK

               As Schaeffer prods Book forward, warily eyeing the Amish.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Get back, you people!
                              (prodding)
                         Keep moving, Johnny...

               Book takes a couple of steps further, then abruptly stops. 
               The Amish stand about close, staring, no one moving. Book 
               now slowly turns his head, looks at Schaeffer.

                                     BOOK
                         You're going to have to do it right 
                         here, Schaeffer.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Don't try me, Johnny!

               Eli steps forward, bloody cloth held to his head.

                                     ELI
                         So... will you kill us all, then?

               ANGLE

               As Schaeffer's eyes waver between Book and Eli, Book slowly 
               turns until he is facing Schaeffer... the gun now leveled  
               and almost pressing against  Book's chest. Book locks eyes 
               with Schaeffer.

               Quietly:

                                     BOOK
                         It's all over, Paul.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Move! Or you die right here!

               Book's right hand snakes out, grabs Schaeffer by the gunhand 
               wrist, twists viciously, Schaeffer SCREAMS in pain, the gun 
               falls out of his hand, he starts to his knees under the force 
               of Book's grip.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As Book bends, picks up the pistol, releases Schaeffer, pushes 
               him away. Schaeffer staggers against Hochstetler, who  partly 
               to keep him from falling, and partly (it appears) to 
               congratulate him on his surrender  wraps one brawny arm 
               around Schaeffer's shoulders, gives him a short approving 
               nod... holds Schaeffer as:

               BOOK

               Turning, looking into the crowd, finding Rachel. Their gazes 
               meet, hold for a long MOMENT. In the eyes of both we read 
               resignation... whatever there was between them has been 
               terribly damaged. It is almost certainly over for them, too.

               EXT. BARN  DAY

               HIGH SHOT holding the moment.

               EXT. LAPP FARM  LATE AFTERNOON

               The door opens and Book steps out, looking somehow strange 
               in his working suit. He looks about him, sees Samuel down by 
               the pond.

               EXT. POND

               He eases down beside Samuel. They both stare into the pond.

                                     SAMUEL
                         Are you really ever coming back?

                                     BOOK

                         a courthouse together, put some people 
                         behind bars.

                                     SAMUEL
                         Have you got your gun on now?

                                     BOOK
                         Sure have, Sam.

               Sam grins. Book takes him in his arms, holds him.

               EXT. HOUSE  DAY

               Book opens the door of the car, turns to find Rachel standing 
               there with his Amish hat in hand.

                                     RACHEL
                         I want you to take this... to remember 
                         by.

               EXT. LANCASTER COUNTY, PA. COUNTRYSIDE  DAY

               TITLE SEQUENCE

               The faces of several young children are presented in CLOSEUP, 
               as they walk TOWARD US across a ploughed field. On the SOUND 
               TRACK, the haunting SOUNDS OF A GREGORIAN FUNERAL CHANT. The 
               CAMERA PANS UP to the faces of older brothers and sisters, 
               then to parents and grandparents. These are not familiar 
               faces, but faces from another age, strong and open. All are 
               dressed in the distinctive clothing of the Amish.

               EXT. COUNTRY LANE  DAY

               Through the last traces of early morning mist another group 
               of black-clad figures make their way down a lane.

               EXT. COUNTRY LANE  DAY

               An Amish buggy, black and highwheeled, stark against the 
               landscape, appears, a spirited chestnut in the traces.

               Framed in the glass window of the narrow buggy is the stern 
               figure of an Amish man in black topcoat and flatbrimmed hat, 
               his bonneted wife in muted colors, the face of a boy, attired 
               like his father, peering out.

               The horse's breath smokes on the frosty air, the buggy CREAKS 
               on its springs, and there's the rhythmic CLIP-CLOP OF HOOVES 
               on the pavement.

               ANOTHER LANE

               Two Amish buggies reach a crossroads, join a procession of 
               three others. They disappear as the lane wends through a 
               leafless thicket of hickory.

               VALLEY

               A BIG SHOT... now the procession numbers almost a dozen 
               buggies... it is headed toward a distant farmhouse.

               BARNYARD

               Where literally dozens of carriages are parked. The horses 
               have been taken from the traces, removed to the shelter of 
               the barn.

               EXT. LAPP FARMHOUSE  FRONT PORCH

               As the black clad mourners begin to move into the house (women 
               and children presumably first).

               INT. LAPP FARMHOUSE

               The coffin has the upper half open. We see that the corpse 
               has been dressed in white linen, a piece of white linen 
               partially covering the bearded face.

               END TITLE SEQUENCE

               INT. LAPP FARMHOUSE

               Partitions have been removed, making the central rooms of 
               the farmhouse a spacious hall. The place is packed, a hundred-
               fifty or more Amish, all sitting in absolute silence on rows 
               of wooden benches. A wooden coffin rests on a bench in the 
               f.g., and near it the close relatives of the deceased occupy 
               a special Place.

               RACHEL LAPP

               A young woman of perhaps twenty-seven. Her face is pale and 
               drawn.

               In happier circumstances, although there haven't been too 
               many of late in Rachel's life, we would see a robust, sensual 
               woman of full figure, spirit and intelligence.

               Eight-year-old SAMUEL LAPP flits next to his mother; he would 
               appear stunned, possibly not entirely comprehending events.

               And the patriarch, ELI LAPP; his stubborn, weathered  yet 
               not unkind  features grief-stricken.

               THE MOURNERS

               Their faces...

               CLOCK

               As it begins to CHIME nine a.m.

               FAVORING PREACHER

               As he removes his hat. As one, the men in the congregation 
               remove their hats also.

               Then the preacher begins to speak in a formal German dialect:

               SUBTITLES OVER.

                                     PREACHER
                         ...a brother has been called home. 
                         God has spoken through the death of 
                         our neighbor, Jacob Lapp...

               THE FAMILY

               Where Rachel, Samuel and Eli are SITTING - SOUNDS of emotion 
               and grief not quite suppressed are heard throughout as:

                                     PREACHER
                         ...husband of Rachel, father to 
                         Samuel, son of Eli.
                              (and)
                         His chair is empty, his bed is empty, 
                         his voice will be heard no more. He 
                         was needed in our presence, but God 
                         needs such men, too. That one should 
                         be taken so suddenly. Treat sorrow. 
                         Still, we would not wish him back. 
                         Rather we should prepare ourselves 
                         to follow him.

               TIGHTENING to the Lapps, and...

               EXT. CEMETERY

               The mourners have gathered about the grave, standing in 
               silence as four pallbearers are lowering the coffin into the 
               pit. The many buggies are aligned in the b.g.

               As the pallbearers begin to shovel soil and gravel into the 
               grave, the Preacher begins to read a hymn in German... a 
               slow atonal litany which seems to hang forever on the frosty 
               air.

               RACHEL

               TIGHTENING to her as the hymn continues...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAPP FARMHOUSE

               Where the Amish have gathered for the traditional post 
               funeral, midday meals.

               Long tables are laden with customary Amishfare... crocks of 
               soup, hams, fowl, fried boiled eggs and pickled beets, 
               preserves and an infinite variety of pies and pastries.

               RACHEL

               Where she sits among women, accepting their condolences.

               DANIEL HOCHSTETLER

               A brawny-armed, ruggedly-handsome, raffish looking Amishman. 
               There is something atypical about his face a slightly sardonic 
               set of mouth, a bold eye, a prominent set of jaw. Not exactly 
               what old Jacob Ammann had in mind, maybe, but a well set-up 
               man nonetheless, and at ease among men. He's among a group 
               of men including old STOLTZFUS, the local healer, FISHER, 
               BIEILER and Bieiler's stout young son, Tom.

                                     STOLTZFUS
                         Lapp was a good farmer. None better.

                                     BEILER
                         But not the man to buy a horse for 
                         you.
                              (and)
                         Hochstetler, wasn't it your father 
                         sold him that horse with a ruptured 
                         testicle?

                                     TOM
                              (grins)
                         Told him it was a bee sting made him 
                         limp that way.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                              (amused)
                         That horse had one good ball. That's 
                         all it takes.

               The others chuckle. But Hochstetler's attention is still on 
               Rachel.

               RACHEL

               As Hochstetler looms on the horizon, plants himself like a 
               tree in front of her.

               At ease as he was with the men, he's a bit awkward at this. 
               All the women, very much aware of Hochstetler's availability, 
               tune in as Rachel looks up.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         I was sorry to hear about Jacob. Let 
                         us hope he walks close with God.

                                     RACHEL
                         I'm sure he does, Daniel.

               FIELDS, LAPP FARM  DAY

               It is some time after the funeral and the Lapp family is 
               hard at work breaking ground for the spring ploughing. The 
               death of Jacob has increased the work load on all three  
               Samuel maneuvers a four-mule team while Rachel and old Eli 
               work nearby, further breaking up the earth. Rachel looks up 
               from the back-breaking labor as several figures approach  
               it's Daniel Hochstetler and two of his brothers. Without a 
               word they fall in beside Eli and Rachel and take up various 
               tasks associated with the work in hand.

               Daniel works close beside Rachel.

               EXT. COUNTRY ROADS, LANCASTER COUNTY  DAY

               A few BRIEF SHOTS of a lone buggy containing the Lapp family 
               take us from the 18th century into the 20th century the 
               reassuring RATTLE OF THE CARRIAGE WHEELS on quiet backroad, 
               to the ROAR OF TRAFFIC as the buggy waits patiently for a 
               chance to cross a busy interstate highway.

               EXT. HIGHWAY, LANCASTER COUNTY  DAY

               A huge tractor trailer rig hovers over the frail buggy as it 
               trots down the interstate. The camera cranes up to reveal a 
               procession of vehicles behind the truck for a chance to 
               overtake it.

               EXT. PLATFORM, LANCASTER STATION  DAY

               Daniel Hochstetler moves through the crowd on the plat-form, 
               Rachel turns surprised, as he approaches, a faint color coming 
               to her cheek.

                                     RACHEL
                         Daniel?

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         I... I was at the feed store. And I 
                         saw your horse, so...

               There is an embarrassment between them broken by the arrival 
               of the train.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         You will come back soon?

               Samuel can barely contain his excitement as he drags at his 
               mother's hand.

                                     SAMUEL
                         Quickly, Mother Quickly!

               Rachel embraces Eli.

                                     ELI
                         You be careful out among them English.

               She turns to Hochstetler.

                                     RACHEL
                         I need time, Daniel.

               EXT. CARPARK, LANCASTER STATION  DAY

               Daniel Hochstetler leaps into the driving seat of his open 
               wagon and with a flick of the reins and a whoop sets his 
               horse off at a fast trot.

               EXT. TRAIN  DAY

               The ENGINE gives a WARNING BLAST before creeping slowly 
               forward.

               INT. TRAIN (MOVING)

               As Samuel spots something out of the window that causes him 
               to light up.

                                     SAMUEL
                         Look, Mama...!

               HIS POV THROUGH WINDOW

               A road runs parallel to the train track, and Hochstetler in 
               his wagon urges his horse almost to the gallop as he attempts 
               to keep pace with the train.

               BACK TO SCENE

               As Rachel smiles.

                                     RACHEL
                         I see, darling.

               And Samuel cranes to look back, waving, for as long as he 
               can.

               EXT. LANCASTER COUNTRYSIDE  DAY

               The train moves across a broad panorama of fields, dotted 
               with dolls'-house-sized farms and the tiny figures of Amish 
               farmers working their horse-drawn equipment.

               SERIES OF CUTS

               As the train continues its eastward journey... Samuel stares 
               raptly out of the window at the changing patterns of the 
               countryside. He points in wonder at a brightly colored hot 
               air balloon as it drifts slowly over timbered hills... he 
               looks unsure as the pattern of field and wood gives way to 
               suburbs, bustling shopping centers, restaurants, car lots 
               and fast food outlets.

               EXT. PHILADELPHIA SLUMS

               As the train travels past dilapidated row houses, streets 
               choked with cars and the gutters with filth.

               INT. TRAIN (MOVING)

               Now Samuel is staring out the window with some confusion, 
               almost apprehension:

                                     SAMUEL
                         Is this where we're going?

                                     RACHEL
                         Of course not. We're going to 
                         Baltimore. It's much nicer in 
                         Baltimore.

               And Rachel draws her son closer, turning her back on the 
               window.

               INT. 30TH ST. STATION, PHILADELPHIA  DAY

               Rachel is in a line at one of the counters. The plain dress 
               of the two Amish  particularly Samuel's black coat and hat 
                are drawing curious stares.

               SAMUEL

               He's uncomfortably aware of the shy looks and giggles of a 
               little girl about his own age, standing in line with her 
               parents at the next counter. He edges away from his mother...

               ANGLE

               As Samuel comes upon a figure garbed in a long black frock 
               coat and flat-brimmed hat... the man's back is turned, could, 
               from appearances, be an Amishman.

               Samuel stares... A beat, the man turns to face Samuel and we 
               discover that he is a Hasidic Jew.

               SAMUEL

               As he reacts.

               BACK TO TICKET COUNTER

               As Rachel's turn arrives. The TICKET SELLER glances up and 
               she shows him her ticket.

                                     RACHEL
                         We have a ticket to Baltimore. Where 
                         is that train, please?

                                     TICKET SELLER
                         Delayed three hours. You'll hear an 
                         announcement when it's time to board.

               He starts to go without his hat, but Rachel collars him and 
               puts it on his head.

               ANGLE IN MEN'S ROOM

               As Samuel enters.

               It's a long row of sinks, urinals, and stalls... Samuel stops 
               before one of the urinals  a long, trough-like affair with 
               water drizzling down the rear porcelain panel.

               It's set a little high for Samuel, and it is making GLUGGING 
               FLUSHING NOISES that are, at least, intimidating. Samuel 
               stares for a moment, then turns, looks toward the stalls, 
               stoops to see which are empty.

               HIS POV  TOILETS

               Beneath the row of doors we can see no feet visible. Samuel 
               is alone in the restroom.

               BACK TO SCENE

               As Samuel proceeds along the row of door, finally selects a 
               stall near the end. He enters. As he does so, a heavily 
               bearded youth in a dirty sweatshirt enters. With some urgency, 
               he removes small notebook from his pocket and places it behind 
               a paper towel dispenser. Suddenly he glances up.

               Two other men have entered the men's room; one is a large 
               BLACK MAN in a three-piece suit under an expensive, overcoat. 
               His PARTNER is a Caucasian in designer jeans, half boots and 
               a short leather jacket.

               They advance on the young man with unmistakable menace.

               The young man whirls in terror; his two assailants lunge for 
               him... a savage, wordless struggle ensues in the close 
               confines of the lavatory.

               ANGLE IN SAMUEL'S STALL

               As the struggling men bounce off the door of his stall... he 
               can see their feet under the edge of the door.

               BACK TO FIGHT

               As the struggle builds to a climax... ends with the young 
               man stiffening with a grunt, his face draining of color.

               The two attackers step away, the blade in the black man's 
               hand bloodstained. His partner stares at what they've 
               accomplished with a stunned expression:

                                     PARTNER
                         Jesus...

               The young man's hand comes away from his belly covered with 
               blood.

               He stares at it, staggers toward the sinks. Finally his 
               bloodied hand reaches to smear at his face in the mirror. 
               Then he collapses to the floor.

               The black man motions for his partner to watch the door, 
               then quickly reaches up and removes the notebook from behind 
               the dispenser.

               ANGLE IN SAMUEL'S STALL

               As he edges open the stall door a crack. Over his shoulder 
               we can see the black man, his BACK TO US, rifling the 
               backpack. But beyond him, in the mirror on the far wall, we 
               catch sight of the black man's face.

               SAMUEL

               As he stares out the narrow crack. A beat, then he closes 
               the stall door.

               ANGLE IN STALL

               Samuel tries to make the latch work, but it's warped and 
               won't fall closed.

               BLACK MAN

               As he checks the notebook before placing it in his pocket. 
               His partner is covering the door, an automatic in his hand.

               The black man makes for the exit, then on second thought, 
               glances at the row of stalls.

               HIS POV  STALLS

               All quiet, but...

               BACK TO SCENE

               The black man whips out a .38 caliber revolver, and, starting 
               at the near end, starts pushing open the stall doors.

               ANGLE IN SAM'S STALL

               As the black man approaches, Samuel working desperately on 
               the latch. At the last minute he finally wedges it in.

               BLACK MAN

               He elbows Samuel's stall... the door won't open.

               ANGLE IN SAM'S STALL

               Fighting back panic, Samuel has retreated as far as he can.

               BLACK MAN

               As he gives the door a kick. It holds. He swears under his 
               breath.

               ANGLE IN SAM'S STALL

               In desperation, Samuel does the only thing he can think of... 
               he slips under the partition into the neighboring stall the 
               black man just checked out. But he loses his hat in the 
               process. His hand snakes back INTO FRAME to snatch it just 
               as the black man gives the door a ferocious kick that 
               splinters the lock and nearly takes it off its hinges. He's 
               framed there, the big muzzle of the .38 revolver looking 
               down our throats.

               ANGLE

               As his partner snaps from the doorway:

                                     PARTNER
                         Will you come on, for Christ's sakes!

               A beat, then the black man holsters his weapon, turns to 
               follow the partner out.

               BACK TO SAMUEL

               As we hear the SOUND OF THE TWO MEN EXITING the lavatory. A 
               long beat, then Samuel opens the stall door a crack.

               HIS POW THROUGH DOOR

               Samuel's own face reflected in the blood-smeared mirror... 
               then PANNING DOWN to the still figure of the young man lying 
               in the crimson pool of his own blood on the floor.

               BENCH WAITING ROOM  LOW ANGLE  NIGHT

               Samuel sits close to his mother, his face pale, his eyes 
               staring.

               Rachel holds his hand tightly in hers as the torsos of various 
               police and officials pass through foreground, occasionally 
               obscuring the lonely couple. There is considerable ECHOING 
               NOISE as commands and requests mingle with the CRACKLE OF 
               TWO-WAY RADIOS.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DOOR  MEN'S' ROOM

               The diffused shape of faces behind the frosted glass of the 
               Men's room door, which is pushed open to reveal, JOHN BOOK, 
               who comes striding through to be momentarily lost in the 
               crowd of police, reporters and others. He is about 40, with 
               a rangy, athletic body. Behind him comes CARTER, Book's black 
               partner  about five years younger than Book. Book is wearing 
               a suit, Carter is much more casually  almost disreputably  
               dressed.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BENCH

               Little Samuel watching Book, back to crowd of police, as 
               Book questions an old black CUSTODIAN.

                                     BOOK
                         You found the body?

                                     CUSTODIAN
                         Uh uh. Not me, daddy, I just reported 
                         it. It was the kid.

                                     BOOK
                         What kid?

                                     CUSTODIAN
                         How'n hell do I know what kid? The 
                         kid in the funny black threads.

               TIGHT SHOT  SAMUEL

               Worry-eyed, still staring straight ahead. Then his eyes move 
               suddenly to his left.

               BOOK'S LEGS  SAMUEL'S POV

               Coming in at full stride, then stopping.

               SAMUEL

               He doesn't raise his eyes... just looks at the legs. And, 
               slowly, the legs begin to bend at the knees. We see Book's 
               belt buckle, then his big pistol in its holster, then his 
               face. He stares at Samuel for a moment, then...

               ANGLE  BOOK

               As his face breaks into a big grin, and...

                                     BOOK
                         Hi, kid.

               RACHEL

               Immediately alarmed, intervening.

                                     RACHEL
                         What do you want of my son?

               THE SCENE

               As Book takes out his wallet, displays his shield.

                                     BOOK
                         I'm a police officer. I'm going to 
                         have to talk to the boy. What's his 
                         name?

                                     RACHEL
                         Samuel. Samuel Lapp.
                              (then, quickly)
                         But what happened here is none of 
                         his affair. My sister is expecting 
                         me... our train is leaving soon.

                                     BOOK
                         There'll be another train.
                              (turns to Samuel)
                         The man who was killed tonight was a 
                         policeman, Sam. It's my job to find 
                         out who did it. I want you to tell 
                         me everything you saw when you went 
                         in there.

                                     SAMUEL
                              (stammers)
                         I saw him.

                                     BOOK
                         Who'd you see?

               Sam looks at his mother.

                         Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the 
                         floor?

                                     SAMUEL
                         No... I saw the man who killed him.

               Book stares at him in surprise, speaks over his shoulder to 
               Carter.

                                     BOOK
                         Anybody know about this?

                                     CARTER
                         I didn't even know about it.

                                     BOOK
                              (back to Sam)
                         Okay, Sam. Can you tell me what he 
                         looked like?

                                     SAMUEL
                              (groping, touching 
                              his clothes and 
                              pointing at Carter)
                         He was... like him.

                         Black... I understand. What else,Sam?

               A beat, then Sam crosses quickly to Carter, Book's rather 
               slightly built partner:

                                     SAMUEL
                         Not Zwartich, like him 

               Book frowns, puzzled:

                                     BOOK
                         Try that one again, Sam 

               Samuel gives his mother a helpless look; exasperated, Rachel 
               intervenes with Book. She glances at Carter:

                                     RACHEL
                         May I talk to you?

               ANGLE

               As Rachel takes Book aside, and in a low voice:

                                     RACHEL
                         Zwartich. It's the way we say... 
                         dwarf.
                              (glances at Carter)
                         Not like him... very big.

               Book nods, starts to turn back to Sam. Just then a commotion 
               off screen catches his attention.

               BOOK'S POV  ONCOMING COPS

               It's Capt. TERRY DONAHUE, Chief of Homicide, striding past 
               the crowd of journalists and TV crews... brushing off 
               reporters' questions and snapping orders to the aides he's 
               got in tow:

               BACK TO SCENE

               AS DONAHUE COMES ON BOOK:

                                     DONAHUE
                              (to aides)
                         Close it all down... I want a man on 
                         every exit... I want the lab in here 
                         now!
                              (to Book)
                         And I want to talk to you, Captain.

               ANGLE

               As Book steps aside with Donahue... In the b.g. Rachel moves 
               protectively to Samuel's side.

                         This is homicide  not Internal 
                         Affairs! So why are you behaving 
                         like you own this case?

                         Terry.
                              (then)
                         I've got a call into Schaeffer.

               RACHEL / SAMUEL

               They can't help but watch the confrontation between Donahue 
               and Book... although they're keeping the volume down, it's 
               obviously intense and angry:

                                     SAMUEL
                              (alarmed)
                         Momma... are they angry with us.

                                     RACHEL
                              (reassuring, but hardly 
                              in her own mind)
                         No... No. It is just the English 
                         way.

               Donahue has lost the confrontation; he gives Book a smile:

                         You ought to think about coming back

                         Internal Affairs and you're not gonna 
                         have any friends left.

               EXT. 30TH ST. STATION  NIGHT

               Book emerges from the terminal, looks about him, then crosses 
               to a big Mercury Sedan which is parked nearby. Two men sit 
               in the front seat. Book crosses to the driver's side and 
               opens the door.

                                     BOOK
                         Go get a cup of coffee, Stan.

               The driver, a uniformed policeman, glances at the man beside 
               him who nods in agreement. He gets out and Book gets in behind 
               the wheel.

               INT. SEDAN

               Book sits next to SCHAEFFER, a surprisingly kindly looking 
               man of about fifty. Schaeffer is a Deputy Chief.

                                     SCHAEFFER

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         What have you got?

                         Maybe.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You know who?

                                     BOOK
                         Maybe.

                         That's the problem. We need results. 
                         The press is driving us crazy over 
                         this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed

                         the sort of thing. It's getting

                         After that the case and the witness 
                         go back to the Homicide Department.

               INT. BOOK'S CAR (MOVING) PHILADELPHIA  NIGHT

               Book drives around 13th Street, a ravaged corridor between 
               neon lit restaurants, bars, porno shops and darkened 
               storefronts.

               Carter sits beside him, Rachel and her son in the back seat 
               looking out at the assorted array of desperate characters 
               huddled in doorways or wandering aimlessly about. On the 
               POLICE RADIO a description of the cop killing is BROADCAST 
               EVERY FEW MINUTES.

                                     CARTER
                         I got there late, John.

                         

                              (grimly)
                         It won't happen again.

                         to do with your laws!

                                     BOOK
                         Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of 
                         people like that.

                                     RACHEL
                         It's not a joke.

               Book decides to try contrition:

                                     BOOK
                         You're right. It's not a joke. Listen, 
                         I know a little about the Amish. I 
                         know this has to be an ordeal for 
                         you; and I'm really sorry you an 
                         Samuel got involved.

               Samuel shoots a look at Book then mutters something to his 
               mother in German. She responds in the same language. Book 
               frowns.

                                     BOOK
                         What was that?

                         name. I told him we don't need to 
                         know anything about you.

               Book eyes Samuel:

               EXT. 13TH ST. STATION  NIGHT

               Book's car stops, and from out of the shadows darts a wizened 
               little MAN. He looks about before crossing to the driver's 
               side window.

               INT. BOOK'S CAR  NIGHT

               Book lowers the window.

               The little man stares at the weird-looking couple in the 
               back seat.

                                     SAMMY

                         Try "Happy Valley".

               EXT. HAPPY VALLEY BAR, SOUTH STREET  NIGHT

               Book's car pulls up outside the bar and he and Carter get 
               out, and move swiftly inside.

               INT. HAPPY VALLEY  NIGHT

               Sixty black faces stare as the police enter. A hush falls on 
               the group. Book and Carter spot their man at the bar and 
               move up either side of him. They've moved carefully to this 
               point... no mistakes. From the back, the black man they've 
               approached certainly looks like he could be the man who did 
               the killing of Zenovitch. And, as Book and Carter make their 
               move...

               EXT. HAPPY VALLEY  NIGHT

               As Book and Carter explode through the door of the bar, 
               violently propelling Coalmine along with them. Now we see 
               Coalmine is not the killer.

               As Book and Carter escort Coalmine out of the bar a police 
               squad car pulls up, its headlights shining into Book's car. 
               An alarmed Rachel holds Samuel close as Book forces Coalmine's 
               face down next to the car window.

                                     BOOK
                         Put some light on him.

               A cop pulls out a flashlight, begins to play the beam over 
               Coalmine's face.

                                     BOOK
                              (continuing; to Samuel)
                         Look at him.

               Crazy as Rasputin on speed and booze, Coalmine glares at 
               Samuel inside the car:

               Samuel, white-faced, finally shakes his head in the negative.

               Coalmine tries to twist free of Book's grip. Book snaps, and 
               slams Coalmine's skull into the window edge, finally crushing 
               his face up against the front window. His face takes on a 
               grotesque shape against the glass. Carter restrains his 
               partner and Book cools down. Coalmine is led stumbling away 
               by the uniformed police. This sudden show of violence has 
               horrified and angered Rachel, and she glares at Book as he 
               gets back in the car.

                                     RACHEL
                         John Book, you listen to me! I will 
                         have no further part in this, nor 
                         will my son! As God stands between 
                         us!

               Book sighs, starts the engine and moves off.

               EXT. HOTEL  PHILADELPHIA  NIGHT

               Book pulls up outside a hotel entrance as a uniformed DOORMAN 
               moves to open the rear door.

               INT. CAR  NIGHT

               Rachel and Sam recoil as the Doorman opens the door. He is 
               puzzled by the sight of the reluctant guests.

                                     DOORMAN

               Book and Carter exchange a glance.

               EXT. / INT. FRONT DOOR, SUBURBAN HOUSE  PHILADELPHIA  
               NIGHT

               An attractive woman in her early thirties in robe and slippers 
               stares in disbelief as Rachel and Sam file into the house. 
               This is ELAINE, Book's sister. She stops Book as he tries to 
               follow Rachel inside.

               As she glances in a doorway.

               HER POV  ELAINE'S KITCHEN

               It's a shambles, with dirty supper dishes piled sink, the 
               table littered with empty beer cans.

               BACK TO RACHEL

                                     BOOK
                         They're Amish.

               ANGLE IN GUEST ROOM

               Samuel is asleep in one twin bed in a tiny, cluttered room.

               Rachel, in a plain nightgown, is preparing to climb into the 
               other one.

               Off screen we hear a DOOR CLOSE, presumably Book leaving. A 
               beat, then Elaine opens the door and looks in.

                                     ELAINE
                         Everything okay?

                                     RACHEL
                         Yes, thank you very much.

                                     ELAINE
                              (a beat)
                         John said you're Amish.

                                     RACHEL
                         Yes.

                                     ELAINE
                              (blankly)
                         Oh.

               She nods and goes.

               Rachel crosses to Samuel, sits on the bed. Samuel looks up 
               at her bleakly.

                                     SAMUEL
                         I don't want to stay here.

                                     RACHEL
                         They are English. They don't 
                         understand.

                                     SAMUEL
                         I wish dawdie was with us.

                                     RACHEL
                              (swallows)
                         I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.

               She puts her hand on his forehead, closes his eyes. she 
               frowns, and...

               EXT. DRIVE-IN FAST-FOOD JOINT  PHILADELPHIA  DAWN

               Carter exits the cafe carrying burgers, donuts and a couple 
               of beers. Book wakes from a brief nap as Carter gets into 
               the car.

               Book chews into his burger while Carter takes a doughnut. 
               Its clear they've worked through the night.

               EXT. ELAINE'S HOUSE  DAY

               Elaine's house is situated on the corner of a row of terraces, 
               which stretch into the distance on both sides of the street.

               INT. ELAINE'S HOUSE

               As Samuel comes out of the guest room in his night-shirt, 
               turns up the hall and opens the door to the bathroom.

               ANGLE

               But it's not the bathroom; it's Elaine's bedroom. She and 
               FRED are tangled in the sheets, furiously making love. Elaine 
               gasps, Fred manages to grunt.

                                     FRED
                         Wrong door, kid.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As Samuel quickly shuts the door. A straight-faced beat; 
               then, barely suppressing a giggle, he hurries on...

               ANGLE IN LIVING ROOM

               As Rachel appears in the living room entry. Samuel is sitting 
               on the floor with two boys of about his own age, watching 
               television.

               They're eating cold cereal out of a box.

               RACHEL'S POV  TV SCREEN

               Some artless Saturday morning cartoon.

               BACK TO RACHEL

               As she frowns, watching her son and the other two staring 
               hypnotically. And...

               ANGLE IN LIVING ROOM

               It's later in the morning now, as Elaine, a bit blearily, 
               appears in the entryway, stares in groggy disbelief.

               HER POV  KIDS

               Her oldest boy and Samuel are busily washing the windows 
               while her youngest is pushing a carpet sweeper. The TV is 
               off.

               BACK TO ELAINE

               As she stares.

               ANGLE IN KITCHEN

               Rachel is standing in the middle of the now immaculate kitchen 
               finishing a brisk mop of the floor. The coffee is perking. 
               Elaine appears.

                                     ELAINE
                              (mutters)
                         Jesus...

               Rachel turns cheerily.

                                     RACHEL
                         Good morning.

                                     ELAINE
                              (helplessly)
                         You didn't have to...

                                     RACHEL
                         I wanted to. you were kind to take 
                         us in last night.
                              (and)
                         Anyway, I needed something to do. I 
                         was so angry with your brother. He's 
                         so... agaanisish!

                                     ELAINE
                         Aganishish? Yeah, that sounds like 
                         John.

               She takes a seat at the table, still shaking her head.

                                     RACHEL
                         Just a minute. I'll pour you some 
                         coffee.

                                     ELAINE
                         You're not carrying a bullwhip... 
                         how'd you manage to put my kids to 
                         work?

                                     RACHEL
                              (smiles)
                         I made it a contest... the one who 
                         does best gets his cereal back first.
                              (and)
                         Children like to help... they only 
                         need to be kept after a little bit.

               Rachel means no harm by this, but Elaine's eyes begin to 
               storm.

                                     ELAINE
                         Oh, is that so?
                              (and)
                         No offense, lady, but I'm not so 
                         sure I like the idea of your coming 
                         in here and turning the place upside 
                         down!

               Rachel's smile fades at Elaine's trembling outburst:

                                     RACHEL
                         Please, I didn't mean...

               Abruptly Elaine rises and snatches the mop from Rachel's 
               hands.

               She mops furiously as she Continues:

                                     ELAINE
                         I know exactly what you meant! Listen, 
                         maybe I'm not a world-class housefrau, 
                         but maybe I don't have time to polish 
                         the goddamn china and keep after the 
                         kids!
                              (and)
                         It's none of your business, but I 
                         don't happen to have a man around 
                         here full time. So I sell cosmetics 
                         in a goddamn drugstore and sometimes 
                         I can even pay the rent on time! So 
                         maybe I'm not Mary Poppins, but maybe 
                         I don't need to have it jammed down 
                         my throat like this.

               She finishes the floor, hurls the mop aside with a CLATTER:

                                     ELAINE
                         There is that clean enough for you?

               Rachel is speechless, Elaine is on the point of bursting 
               into tears. At which point Fred appears at the entry in his 
               undershirt, taking in the sparkling kitchen.

                                     FRED
                         Jesus, Elaine... Somebody die and 
                         leave you a broom?

               Not a politic observation on Fred's part.

                                     ELAINE
                              (blurts)
                         Go to hell, Fred!

               And, bursting into tears, she flees the kitchen. Fred stares 
               after her.

                                     FRED
                         What's bugging her?

               Unperturbed, he crosses to the counter and the coffee pot, 
               letting his eyes take in Rachel's full figure.

               INT. ELAINE'S BEDROOM

               As Rachel comes in with Elaine's coffee, closes the door 
               behind her. Elaine is lying across the bed, sobbing.

                                     RACHEL
                         I brought your coffee.

               She takes a seat next to the bed.

                                     RACHEL
                         I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that 
                         way.

               After a moment, Elaine starts to pull herself together:

                                     ELAINE
                         It's okay.
                              (and)
                         Look, I shouldn't have blown my top. 
                         It's like... somehow... I've let 
                         everything get away from me. And you 
                         sort of made me face it.

               She takes the cup, sips the coffee. Rachel smiles at a private 
               thought.

                                     ELAINE
                         What's so funny?

                                     RACHEL
                         Fred. The way he looked when you 
                         screamed at him.

                                     ELAINE
                              (disparing)
                         God, Fred...

                                     RACHEL
                         At home you'd never hear a woman 
                         scream at a man that way.

                                     ELAINE
                         No? Why not?

                                     RACHEL
                         You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish 
                         way.
                              (then)
                         But I think it would have done me 
                         good if I could have screamed at 
                         your brother last night.

                                     ELAINE
                         Listen, I don't know what's going on 
                         or how you got mixed up with him, 
                         but don't you let that self-righteous 
                         son of a bitch push you around, okay?

               Rachel smiles.

                                     RACHEL
                         Okay.

               INT. BOOK'S CAR (MOVING)  DAY

               Book glances irritably at Rachel:

                                     BOOK
                         Now what's the problem?

                                     RACHEL
                         The problem is I don't happen to 
                         think my son should be spending all 
                         his time with a man who carried a 
                         gun under his coat and goes around 
                         whacking people.

               Book gives her a look:

                                     BOOK
                         Whacking?

                                     RACHEL
                              (firmly)
                         Yes. And I also want to leave this 
                         city.

                                     BOOK
                         Believe me, I'm trying to get this 
                         over with as fast as I can. But Samuel 
                         will probably have to come back and 
                         testify.

                                     RACHEL
                         We do not go into your courts.

                                     BOOK
                         People who don't go into our courts 
                         when they're told to sometimes go 
                         directly into our jail.

               Rachel glares at him and the ride continues on that chilly 
               note for a beat.

                                     BOOK
                         Look, I'm genuinely sorry...

                                     RACHEL
                              (snaps)
                         No you're not 
                              (off his look)
                         You're glad, because now you've got 
                         a witness.
                              (and)
                         I heard the other police talking 
                         last night.
                              (and)
                         They don't seem to like you very 
                         much.

                                     BOOK
                         They kid a lot.

                                     RACHEL
                              (glances at him)
                         I would not be too sure.

               Samuel has been glancing at Book; finally he says something 
               to his mother in German. Book gives her an inquiring look.

                                     RACHEL
                         He says you look very tired. I thought 
                         the same thing.

               Book says nothing.

                                     RACHEL
                         But not a good tired.

                                     BOOK
                         What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired.

               She doesn't bother to explain; Book settles even deeper into 
               his funk as Samuel glares at him with hostility.

               INT. IDENTIFICATION ROOM  POLICE H.Q.  DAY

               Samuel sits with Book at a desk, Rachel just behind. They 
               are looking at a police line-up of known black drug-dealers. 
               Samuel shakes his head  another negative.

               Book winks, slyly reaches into a pocket, produces a yellow 
               gumball. He surreptitiously shows it to Samuel, gives him an 
               inquiring look. It's a peace offering.

               Samuel grins, nods imperceptibly.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As Book rolls the gumball down the table to Samuel. But just 
               as Samuel is about to cover it with his hand, Rachel reaches 
               over and plucks it off the table. She shakes her head at 
               Samuel.

                                     BOOK
                              (to Rachel)
                         Just wanted to see if you were on 
                         your toes.

               EXT. CITY PARK  DAY

               Book, Sam and Rachel sit on a park bench eating a lunch of 
               hot dogs heaped with kraut.

               Book watches with amusement as Samuel wolfs down his lunch. 
               Rachel eyes him a beat. then:

                                     RACHEL
                         Your sister said you don't have a 
                         family?

                                     BOOK
                         No.

                                     RACHEL
                         She thinks you should get married 
                         and have children of your own. Instead 
                         of trying to be a father to hers. 
                         Except she thinks you're afraid of 
                         the responsibility.

               Book gives her a look:

                                     BOOK
                         Oh? Anything else?

                                     RACHEL
                         Oh yes. She thinks you like policing 
                         because you think you're right about 
                         everything. And you're the only one 
                         who can do anything. And that when 
                         you drink a lot of beer you say things 
                         like none of the other police would 
                         know a crook from a... um... bag of 
                         elbows.

               Book is staring at her. Rachel nods.

                                     RACHEL
                         I think that's what she said.

               Just then Samuel belches with huge satisfaction, drawing 
               looks from Book and a couple of passersby. Rachel smiles 
               proudly.

                                     RACHEL
                         Good appetite.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. OUTER OFFICE/WAITING ROOM, NARCOTICS DIVISION  DAY

               Rachel sits uneasily in the outer office, one or two police 
               clerks eyeing her curiously. A sign on the desk reads 
               "Narcotics Division."

               Rachel cranes forward trying to peer through a partially 
               open door.

               INT. DETECTIVES ROOM, NARCOTICS DIVISION, POLICE H.Q.  DAY

               A group of Narcotics Detectives are interrupted in mid 
               conversation by the opening of the main office door. They 
               stare in considerable surprise.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               JOHN BOOK

               Standing in the doorway, holding little Samuel by the hand.

                                     BOOK
                         Afternoon, gentlemen. I'd like you 
                         to meet Samuel Lapp. We'd like a 
                         little help.

               INT. SMALL OFFICE, NARCOTICS DIVISION  DAY

               A Narcotics Detective enters the room laden with several 
               volumes of mug shots. He puts them on the desk beside a 
               similar book which Samuel is intently studying. Sam sits on 
               the chair cushions in a big swivel rocker.

               The Detective, SGT. KAMAN, eyes Book a little suspiciously  
               internal affairs officers are not greeted warmly by the 
               working policemen in any department.

                                     KAMAN
                         There's a Sgt. Carter on the phone 
                         for you.

               Book gets up and moves to the door.

                                     KAMAN
                         And, Captain, don't want to rush 
                         you, but I'm gonna need these files 
                         back in a half hour. We got a lot of 
                         work to do round here.

               The two men leave. Samuel looks about before hopping off his 
               perch and following the direction taken by Book.

               INT. DETECTIVES ROOM, NARCOTICS DIVISION  DAY

               Through glass partitions we can see Book on the telephone in 
               a cubicle of an office.

               Samuel has drifted out of the office and is idling amid the 
               bustle of the squadroom.

               He crosses to a glass case which holds a collection of plaques 
               and framed newspaper accounts which denote instances of 
               outstanding duty and achievement.

               ANGLE THOUGH GLASS CASE

               As Samuel moves along, only half interested in what his eyes 
               are taking in, not really old enough to comprehend anyway.

               Until suddenly he freezes.

               SAMUEL'S POV  NEWSPAPER ACCOUNT

               Enlarged, prominently displayed. The headline reads: "Division 
               Chief McElroy Honored For Youth Project". Accompanying the 
               item is a large sidebar mug-shot of McElroy  clearly the 
               black man who murdered the young cop in the train station 
               men's room.

               BACK TO SAMUEL

               He stares, transfixed.

               A long beat, then Book, lowering himself to one knee next to 
               Samuel, ENTERS FRAME.

               He's watching Samuel, knowing from the boy's expression that 
               they've found their man. Samuel slowly raises his hand to 
               point at the photograph. Book gently takes the boy's small 
               hand in his, concealing the accusation from watchful eyes. 
               He smiles gently at the boy.

               INT. BOOK'S CAR (MOVING)  PHILADELPHIA  DUSK

               Rachel is curled tight in her corner of the front seat holding 
               Samuel close. Book glances at her:

                                     RACHEL
                         Why don't you arrest that man? Are 
                         you protecting him because policeman?

                                     BOOK
                              (snaps)
                         Listen, I'm the cop that polices the 
                         police. I'm not in the business of 
                         protecting crooked cops.
                              (eases up)
                         I'll make an arrest when I know 
                         everybody involved.

               Rachel shakes her head.

                                     RACHEL
                         But why would they murder...

                                     BOOK
                         Because  somehow  they knew I was 
                         getting close.
                              (and)
                         Look, it's narcotics... They make 
                         dope out of chemicals... they sell 
                         it on the street for millions of 
                         dollars. They'll do anything.
                              (and)
                         And they can get away with it because 
                         they're cops.

                                     RACHEL
                              (beat, then)
                         I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I 
                         want to go home.

                                     BOOK
                         You'll be safe. You don't have to 
                         worry.

               She says nothing.

               Another beat, then:

                                     BOOK
                         Look, they're thinking as long as 
                         they keep the killer out of Samuel's 
                         way, we can't make an I.D. There's 
                         no way they can know Samuel saw that 
                         photograph, so he's safe.

               He glances at her, but she continues ahead.

                                     BOOK
                         I mean it. You will be safe.

               Suddenly Rachel explodes:

                                     RACHEL
                         Oh yes! Of Course. Why shouldn't we 
                         feel safe in a city where the police 
                         are so busy killing each other!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. / INT. SCHAEFFER HOME, PHILADELPHIA SUBURBS  NIGHT

               The front door of Schaeffer's upper-middle class home is 
               opened by his wife MARILYN. She knows Book and is surprised 
               and delighted to see him. In the background daughter KATHY 
               is visible. Schaeffer himself appears and Book is welcomed 
               inside.

               INT. SCHAEFFER'S STUDY  NIGHT

               Schaeffer passes Book a drink.

               Book is excited, animated... the hunter, after a long chase, 
               closing on his quarry:

                                     BOOK
                         It was McElroy, Paul.

               Schaeffer gives him a sharp look:

                                     BOOK
                         Last guy I would have figured. But 
                         he's part of it.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         I hope you don't have any doubts 
                         about that.

                                     BOOK
                         If I did, I'd have kept my mouth 
                         shut...
                              (and)
                         It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons 
                         of P2P confiscated four years ago... 
                         Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.
                              (excited, explaining 
                              the thing eagerly)
                         He salts it away somewhere... he 
                         knows the stuff is potent, but the 
                         street chemists haven't figured out 
                         how to process it. But they do now.
                              (and)
                         And now the stuff is worth five-grand 
                         a pint and there are a lot of pints 
                         in a fifty-five gallon drum.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (beat)
                         Who else knows?

                                     BOOK
                         Just us.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (shakes his head)
                         Okay, what are you going to need to 
                         clean it up

                                     BOOK
                         More people... Gotta pick up where 
                         Zenovich left off. People from outside 
                         the department.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (nods)
                         Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards 
                         at Treasury. I'll take care of it.
                              (then)
                         I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut 
                         their balls off for me. I'm counting 
                         on you.

               Schaeffer pours himself another drink.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         What's your first move?

                                     BOOK
                              (expels a breath)
                         A hot shower... I haven't changed 
                         clothes in two days.

               EXT. PARKING LOT  PHILADELPHIA  NIGHT

               Book slams the front door of his car, checks it for being 
               locked, glances at a roiled newspaper in his hand (the sports 
               section of the Inquirer), starts across the parking lot toward 
               his apartment, walking as he keeps glancing down at the sports 
               section. He comes to a sort of crosswalk, stops, reads, starts 
               to take a step... and looks up.

               WHAT HE SEES

               McElroy, smiling nicely, starting across toward him from the 
               other side of the parking lot crosswalk

               BACK TO BOOK

               Freezing, eyes widening. Utterly surprised and caught.

               MCELROY

               Still smiling, he brings up his right hand out of a shopping 
               bag (which he appeared to be carrying)  letting the shopping 
               bag fall away as he does so  revealing a five-inch barrel 
               Smith and Wesson .357 blue finish revolver with a silencer. 
               Without hesitating, coming right on, still smiling, he FIRES 
               once.

               BOOK

               Already starting to leap away to one side, he is hit, driven 
               into a half-turn. He clutches at the wound, as:

               MCELROY

               Coming right on, FIRING again... the pistol's report a 
               WHOOSHING, like the opening of a bottle of cheap champagne. 
               And McElroy still smiling as:

               BOOK

               Hit... a grazing near-miss this time, but enough to send 
               Book down hard and grasping.

               MCELROY

               Lowering the pistol alongside his leg, as two MEN, barely 
               taking notice of anything, cross with their backs to Book 
               toward McElroy.

               He smiles at them.

               BOOK

               Down, muttering CURSES.

               THE SCENE

               As McElroy walks past Book, drops the pistol to the pavement, 
               keeps on going... and is gone.

               BOOK

               GROANING in pain, beginning to try to crawl crab-like. And 
               we HEAR  from the agonized recesses of Book's Dream.

                                     SCHAEFFER (V.O.)
                         Who else knows?

                         Just us.

               As the lights of an oncoming car  going very slowly, on its 
               way to a parking space  sweep over him and we HEAR it come 
               to a sudden, squealing stop. Book is already trying to get 
               to his feet... now succeeds, lurching into a swaying stance, 
               using an adjacent car for support. OFF SCREEN we HEAR a car 
               door slam, and footsteps hurrying in our direction, 
               accompanied by excited voices. Book HEARS, turns to face the 
               oncomers,

               ANGLE

               A fat, middle-aged MAN has approached to within some feet of 
               Book, looks on edgily:

                                     MAN
                         Hey, buddy, what's the score? Little 
                         too much to drink?

               Book stares at him, then looks down at his belly.

               BOOK'S WOUND

               As Book removes his hand we can see one of the bullets struck 
               him low in the side, just below the ribcage... the other 
               just above it (but this one inflicting only minor damage).

               THE SCENE

               As the man stares:

                                     MAN
                         Goddamn, buddy. You better get to a 
                         hospital!
                              (and)
                         Here; I'll give you a hand.

               He starts to approach, but Book shoves him away.

                                     BOOK
                         No! No hospital!

               By now the man's WIFE is hovering at a safe distance:

                                     WIFE
                         Let him alone, Henry! If he wants to 
                         die in the street, that's his 
                         business!

               But the man is not content:

                                     MAN
                         Shut up, Romona! Will ya look at 
                         that blood?

               Book has tried to lurch toward his car; the man tries to 
               intercept him:

                                     MAN
                         Come on, buddy... you're gonna bleed 
                         to death!

               Book whirls on him, his service revolver in his hand pointed 
               squarely at the fat man's face:

                                     MAN
                         Shit!

                                     WIFE
                              (quavering)
                         I told you, Henry!

               Book doesn't trust himself to speak, but the .38 is 
               sufficiently eloquent for the circumstances, He stares at 
               the fat man another beat, then hesitates, turns, starts back 
               toward his car.

               EXT. STREET  PHILADELPHIA  NIGHT

               As he's awakened by the RINGING bedside telephone. He snaps 
               on a lamp... He's instantly awake, not unused to such rousing 
               in the wee hours. A woman sleeps beside him.

               There's a stunned silence at the other end.

               As the door opens and Elaine switches on the light, rousing 
               Rachel. Elaine looks haggard.

                                     ELAINE
                         It's John. He says you have to leave 
                         now. He says it's urgent.

               She leaves the room as Rachel instantly awake, moves quickly 
               to rouse Samuel.

               EXT. BATHROOM DOOR

               Elaine is outside the bathroom listening to instructions 
               from her brother. From inside we hear the SOUND OF RUNNING 
               WATER. Elaine is puzzled but also senses the urgency.

               Book looks at himself in the mirror, his face is pale and 
               drawn.

               He examines the wound, a cleanly drilled hole through his 
               right side, just under the rib cage. The wound continues to 
               bleed as he binds a towel tightly about him, before putting 
               his shirt back on.

               He then carefully wipes away any traces of blood on basin 
               with tissues which he flushes down the toilet.

               INT. BOOK'S CAR (MOVING)

               As he drives across town. Samuel is curled up asleep, his

               But Book, glancing in his rearview mirror, tenses.

               In it we can see a police car coming on fast, with lights 
               and SIREN.

               Rachel eyes Book warily.

               A beat, then the police car WAILS past. Book expels a breath.

               away, closing the door. Book begins to turn the car around

               The car has failed to take a bend in the road and is now 
               bouncing across an adjoining ploughed field. It's knocked 
               over a tall birdhouse by the roadside. The car finally comes 
               to rest against a bank of earth.

               BACK TO RACHEL

               She stares...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FIELD  DAY

               As Samuel races for all he's worth across the field, 
               negotiates the creek via a fallen log  Rachel, now, also 
               running toward the car.

               EXT. STABLES  DAY

               Eli works fast harnessing his mules to an open wagon. He 
               hops up to the front seat and urges them to trot.

               ANGLE AT BOOK'S CAR

               We see that Rachel has made Book as comfortable as possible 
               in the front seat of the car and is packing the wound under 
               his trenchcoat with material ripped from her apron. 
               Momentarily he comes awake:

                                     RACHEL
                         But John... why didn't you go to a 
                         hospital?

                                     BOOK
                         No, no doctor...

                                     RACHEL
                              (bewildered)
                         But why?

                                     BOOK
                         Gunshot... they'll file reports... 
                         they'll find me.

                                     RACHEL
                         But 

               Book reaches up to grip her arm fiercely:

                                     BOOK
                         And when they find me, they'll find 
                         your boy!

               He slips under again. Rachel stares at him, realizing the 
               price he's paid in returning them to safety.

               She reaches out, touches him gently.

               But the moment is broken by...

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As Eli reins up in the springwagon. He climbs down, crosses 
               to glance into the car.

                                     ELI
                         Is the English dead?

                                     RACHEL
                         No...

                                     ELI
                         Looks dead...

               And together they begin to lift Book from the car and place 
               him in the back of the springwagon. And...

               INT. LAMP FARMHOUSE

               Where Eli is looking out a window.

               HIS POV  BUGGY

               An Amish buggy coming up the drive, past Book' s car.

               ANGLE IN BEDROOM

               Where Book lies on a bed. Rachel is bathing his wound with 
               warm water from a pan.

               Eli appears in the doorway.

                                     ELI
                         Stoltzfus is coming.

               Rachel looks at him, nods.

               Eli frowns at Book's holstered pistol lying atop his neatly 
               folded clothes on a chair near the bed.

                                     ELI
                         That has no place in this house.

                                     RACHEL
                         I know.

               She picks up the pile of clothes and the pistol and places 
               them in a chest.

                                     RACHEL
                         It will go when he goes.

               INT. LIVING ROOM

               As Samuel comes in with old Stoltzfus and Stoltzfus's teenage 
               son, LEVI.

                                     RACHEL
                         Thank you for coming, Stoltzfus.

               Stoltzfus's eyes have gone to the bed:

                                     STOLTZFUS
                         That's the English is it?

               INT. SICKROOM  TIGHT

               As Stoltzfus runs his fingers lightly over the vicinity of 
               Book's wound:

                                     STOLTZFUS (O.S.)
                         I feel... burning.

               WIDER

               As Stoltzfus, in his shirt sleeves and concentrating mightily, 
               moistens his fingertips with saliva, continues the 
               examination.

               Finally he steps back.

                                     STOLTZFUS
                         This man should be treated in town.
                              (indicates)
                         The bullet entered there... and came 
                         out there. But there is the danger 
                         of infection, and he has lost a great 
                         deal of blood.

               Rachel looks at Stoltzfus, then turns away, torn by her 
               dilemma.

               Her eyes fall on Samuel. Gently she ushers him from the room:

                                     RACHEL
                         Go help Levi with the car, Samuel.

               She closes the door after him, then turns to face Eli and 
               Stoltzfus:

                                     RACHEL
                         No, he must stay here.

               Stoltzfus gives Eli a puzzled look. And:

                                     ELI
                         Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if 
                         he dies? Then the sheriff will come. 
                         They'll say we broke their laws 

                                     RACHEL
                         We'll pray that he doesn't die! But 
                         if he does, then we'll find a way so 
                         no one knows!

                                     ELI
                         Rachel, this is a man's life, we 
                         hold it in our hands.

                                     RACHEL
                         I know God help me, I know that, 
                         Eli.
                              (then)
                         But I tell you that if he's found 
                         here, the people who did this to him 
                         will come for Samuel.

               Rachel beseeches them helplessly:

                                     RACHEL
                         What else can we do?

               EXT. LAPP DRIVE

               Levi has hitched Eli's mules to the rear of Book's car and 
               is towing it up the drive toward the barn, with Samuel 
               catching a ride on the bumper.

               RACHEL

               Where she's waiting with the big barn doors thrown open. As 
               the mules tow the car in, she closes the doors.

               INT. LAPP FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM

               As Stoltzfus and Levi are about to go: Stoltzfus turns to 
               Rachel:

                                     STOLTZFUS
                         Make a poultice... three parts milk, 
                         two parts linseed oil... for the 
                         infection.

               I'll send Mary by with some teas I will brew myself.

                                     RACHEL
                         Thank you.

               Stoltzfus turns to Eli:

                                     STOLTZFUS
                         Lapp, I'll have to speak with the 
                         diener on this matter.

                                     ELI
                              (nods)
                         As you see fit, Stoltzfus.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SICKROOM  LAPS FARM  NIGHT

               As Rachel enters, turns up a kerosene lamp which is burning 
               low at bedside. She's carrying the poultice Stoltzfus ordered.

               Book's brow is beaded with sweat.

               Rachel seats herself next to the bed, strips away the sweat-
               soaked sheet. Her eyes take in his bare torso, and we should 
               get the feeling that there's rather more male animal on 
               display here just now than she's quite comfortable with.

               She begins to apply the poultice.

               ANGLE

               As Book rouses to semi-consciousness, in his delirium he 
               recoils with alarm.

                                     RACHEL
                         It's all right! You have got to lie 
                         still.

               Book stares up at her without recognition, but some of what 
               she says seems to penetrate. He quiets.

                                     RACHEL
                              (soothingly)
                         Yes, much better...

               ANGLE

               As Book lapses back into sleep. Rachel hasn't removed her 
               hand from his chest. Abruptly she does so.

               She finds herself wondering about this man lying before her, 
               so suddenly a part of her life. She notices details; bruises, 
               scars, the knuckles are hard, grazed, a tattoo on one 
               shoulder. While lost in this reverie, the delirious 
               Philadelphia policeman begins to mutter. Incoherently at 
               first, then the words take shape  swear words; curses; fuck 
               this and that; shit; etc. Rachel rises abruptly, her cheeks 
               coloring, as the barrage of language pours from his mouth. 
               She beats a hasty retreat closing the door swiftly behind 
               her.

               INT. SCHAEFFER'S OFFICE  DAY

               He's on the phone:

                         Looks like we're going to need some 
                         help from you folks down there.

               INT. LANCASTER COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE  DAY

               Where an UNDERSHERIFF is on the phone:

                                     UNDERSHERIFF
                         ...want to help any way we can, Chief, 
                         but you got to understand we've got 
                         upwards of seven thousand Amish over 
                         here.

               And that's just Lancaster County.

               INTERCUT SCHAEFFER

               Who is trying to control his impatience:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         I've got the woman's name, Sheriff. 
                         Lapp. Rachel Lapp. That should 
                         simplify your work.

               The Undersheriff frowns. He doesn't like being talked down 
               to.

                                     UNDERSHERIFF
                         How about an address?

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Ah... no.

                                     UNDERSHERIFF
                              (frowns)
                         Maybe a road or route number?

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Sorry.

               The Undersheriff is not impressed.

                                     UNDERSHERIFF
                         Problem is, Chief, 'bout every third 
                         Amishman around here is named Lapp. 
                         That or Yoder. Or Hochstetler.
                              (and)
                         Chief, if the Amish have taken your 
                         man in, I wouldn't want to hang from 
                         a rope until you find him.

               ANGLE

               Schaeffer is tight-lipped with contained fury:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Thank you, Sheriff. It's been an 
                         education.

               He hangs up. A beat; the man is a study in frustration. Then 
               he glances up.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Standing in his doorway are the two plainclothesmen who 
               spotted Carter in Book's office in the earlier scene. And...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LAPP FARM  DAY

               A bright, sunny afternoon.

               SAMUEL

               Where he's leading a team of horses to the barn. In the b.g. 
               three buggies are parked in the barnyard, traces empty. 
               Visitors.

               ANGLE IN SICKROOM

               Where Book lies in the bed. His fever seems to have subsided. 
               He's coming awake, tries to focus on the room.

               BOOK'S POV  CLERGY

               PANNING the four men in Amish black who are standing around 
               the bed looking down at Book, muttering among themselves in 
               German.

               These include TSCHANTZ, the district bishop, a hawk-nosed, 
               sterneyed old fellow; Stoltzfus, a deacon as well as a healer; 
               and two preachers, ERB and HERSHBERGER. Eli stands somewhat 
               apart.

               ANGLE

               Another moment of silence, then Book opens his eyes.

               Tschantz rumbles in German.

               SUBTITLES OVER.

                                     TSCHANTZ
                         Well, Stoltzfus, another Lazarus to 
                         your credit.

                         He was touched by God's hand.

               Tschantz grunts, motions, for the other clergy aside with 
               him.

               Rachel enters briskly with a steaming pot of tea and a cup, 
               smiles.

                                     RACHEL
                         Hello.

               Book stares at her, then at the old bearded gentlemen.

                                     BOOK
                              (closing his eyes)

                                     RACHEL
                         The leadership of our district... 
                         the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the 
                         one with no hair on top. They decided 
                         to come and see you for themselves. 
                         Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came 
                         the first day. I think he saved your 
                         life.

                                     RACHEL

                         Listen, thank you. Thanks for 
                         everything. But I've got to go.

                                     RACHEL
                              (frowns)
                         But you can't.

               He tries to rise, falls back faint. Rachel rearranges the 
               sheet.

                                     RACHEL
                         See. Anyway, you don't have any 
                         clothes on. And besides that, Bishop 
                         Tschantz wants to talk to you when 
                         you feel better.

               The elders appear to have concluded their conference, and 
               are filing out. Stoltzfus pauses at bedside.

                                     STOLTZFUS
                         Rest, Mr. Book. That's the ticket. 
                         And drink my of my tea.

               He goes. Book is still fending off the dizziness. Rachel 
               puts the teacup to his lips.

                                     BOOK

                         You tell him. When you're able.

               He looks like he's about to drop off again. Rachel rises.

                                     RACHEL
                              (from the door)
                         We're all very happy that you're 
                         going to live, John Book. We didn't 
                         quite know what we were going to do 
                         with you if you died.

               That penetrates for a moment just before Book slips into 
               sleep again.

               As the rather worrisome Hershberger frowns:

                                     HERSHBERGER
                         ...but a gunshot wound. Very serious.

                                     TSCHANTZ
                         It is not the first time we have 
                         done this. In the Englischer war of 
                         the revolution, old Elmer Miller's 
                         grandfather took in gunshot English 
                         soldiers.
                              (a tad of pride)
                         Saved them, too.

               They all nod. What Tschantz says is well known. Then:

                                     ERB
                         Still, he should be among his own 
                         people.

               Rachel enters on this last.

                                     RACHEL
                         He'll leave as soon as he is able. 
                         He already wants to go.

               Hershberger gives her a gloomy look, turns to Stoltzfus:

                                     HERSHBERGER
                         How long will that be, Stoltzfus?

                              (shrugs)
                         A month. Maybe less. With God's 
                         healing love.

               EXT. BOOK'S SISTER'S HOUSE  PHILADELPHIA  DAY

               Schaeffer is knocking at the front doors. A beat, then Elaine 
               opens it cautiously, peers out.

                                     ELAINE
                              (half fearfully)
                         Did you find him?

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Not yet.

               Suddenly her eyes blaze, she starts to close the door:

                                     ELAINE
                         Then go away, you bastard.

               Schaeffer quickly  but gently  prevents her from shutting 
               it.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Elaine, I've come to apologize for 
                         Lt. McElroy. He overstated the 
                         department's position.

                                     ELAINE
                              (bitterly)
                         He accused John of taking kickbacks. 
                         And you know  anybody who knows 
                         John  knows that's a goddamn lie!

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (smoothly)
                         Of course, Elaine. But as long as 
                         there's any question, better Johnny 
                         should come back and clear his name.

                                     ELAINE
                              (cuts in)
                         Better you should get off my front 
                         porch before I get my mace!

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Elaine, I don't want to have to take 
                         you in for questioning. You've got 
                         his car, you were the last to see 
                         him 

                         I don't know where he is.

                                     SCHAEFFER

               McElroy watching.

               THEIR POV  FRONT DOOR

               We see a final exchange between Elaine and Schaeffer. Elaine 
               forces the door shut. Schaeffer turns, walks slowly to his 
               car.

               INT. SCHAEFFER'S CAR

               As Schaeffer opens the door, climbs in, sinks wearily into 
               the seat, beside McElroy.

                                     MCELROY
                         She say where he is?

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         I don't think she knows.

               Schaeffer is staring grimly ahead.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         What about Carter?

                                     MCELROY
                         Tight. But I'm working on him.

                         Lean on him.

               EXT. LAPP FARM  LANCASTER COUNTY  NIGHT

               REESTABLISHING, and TIGHTENING to the upstairs sickroom window 
               where a lamp dimly burns.

               INT. SICKROOM

               As Samuel comes in with a fresh bedpan. Book is lying asleep 
               on the bed.

               Samuel puts the bedpan down, checks to make sure Book is 
               indeed asleep, then quietly crosses to the foot of the bed 
               and opens the clothes chest.

               ANGLE

               Book's big .38 revolver lies holstered atop his folded 
               clothes.

               Fascinated, Samuel picks it up, admiring the heavy burled 
               pistol grips. Unable to resist, he starts to remove the weapon 
               from the holster, then pauses to steal a look. OFF SCREEN...

               BOOK

               His eyes are open and watching Samuel icily, which gives the 
               boy something of a jolt.

                                     BOOK
                         Give me that.

               Mutely, Samuel hands Book the pistol from arm's length. He 
               looks on as Book takes the pistol out of the holster, shoots 
               the boy another look, then snaps open the cylinder and shakes 
               out the heavy, copper-jacketed bullets into his palm. He 
               snaps the cylinder closed again, then nods to Samuel.

                                     BOOK

                              (swallows)
                         No pistol. Ever.

                         handle this one. But only if you 
                         promise not to say anything to your 
                         momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't 
                         understand.

                                     SAMUEL
                              (grins)
                         Okay, Mr. Book.

               Book smiles. Then he gives the boy a playful, John Wayne-
               tough guy wink as he cocks and uncorks the pistol, 
               demonstrating the action.

               He finally hands it over to Samuel, butt first.

               The boy tries to imitate Book's one-handed expertise, but 
               his hands are too small. Book smiles.

               Samuel finally manages to get the thing cocked, using two 
               hands, and Book reaches over to guide the muzzle away so 
               that it's not pointed at him.

                         you just started calling by their 
                         first name.

               Samuel levels the pistol at the door and, just as he snaps 
               the trigger, Rachel enters, pulls up short in some dismay to 
               find her son has a gun pointed at her. Samuel blanches and 
               Book winces, knowing there's heavy weather ahead.

                                     RACHEL
                              (snaps)
                         Samuel!

               Samuel quickly hands the pistol back to Book, who holsters 
               it:

                                     RACHEL
                         Wait for me downstairs.

               Samuel quickly exits, and Rachel angrily advances on Book.

                                     RACHEL
                         John Book, I would appreciate it if, 
                         during the time you are with us, you 
                         would have as little to do with Samuel 
                         as possible.

                         Nobody meant any harm. The boy was 
                         curious. I unloaded the gun -

                                     RACHEL
                         It's not the gun. Don't you 
                         understand... It's you. What you 
                         stand for.
                              (and)
                         That is not for Samuel.

               Book looks at her thoughtfully.

               Rachel softens a bit:

                                     RACHEL
                         Please, it has nothing to do with 
                         you personally.

               He hands her the holstered gun and the loose bullets.

                         Put it up someplace Samuel can't get 
                         it.

               A beat, then Rachel, takes the pistol and starts to go. Book 
               stops her:

                                     BOOK
                         Friends?

               Rachel glances back at him, smiles and nods. And...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KITCHEN  LAPP FARMHOUSE  NIGHT

               Book's holstered gun and bullets at center table. Eli sits 
               on one side, a chastened Samuel on the other. Rachel looks 
               on from the b.g.

               Eli knows that this is as important a dialogue as he will 
               ever have with his grandson: at issue is one of the central 
               pillars of the Amish way.

                                     ELI
                         The gun  that gun of the hand  is 
                         for the taking of human life. Would 
                         you kill another man? Eh?

               Samuel stares at it, not meeting his grandfather's eyes. Eli 
               leans forward, extends his hands ceremonially.

                                     ELI
                         What you take into your hands, you 
                         take into your heart.

               A beat, then Samuel musters some defiance.

                                     SAMUEL
                         I would only kill a bad man.

                                     ELI
                         Only a bad man. I see. And you know 
                         these bad men on sight? You are able 
                         to look into their hearts and see 
                         this badness?

                                     SAMUEL
                         I can see what they do.

               Now he meets Eli's eyes:

                                     SAMUEL
                         I have seen it.

               Eli expels a deep sigh; then:

                                     ELI
                         And having seen, you would become 
                         one of them?
                              (intent... gesturing)
                         Don't you see...? The hand leads the 
                         arm leads the shoulder leads the 
                         head... leads the heart. The one 
                         goes into the other into the other 
                         into the other... And you have 
                         changed, and gone amongst them...

               He breaks off, bows his head for a moment. Then he fixes the 
               boy with a stern eye and, driving he heel of his palm firmly 
               into the tabletop with enormous intensity:

                                     ELI
                         "Wherefore come out from among them 
                         and be ye separate, saith the Lord!"

                                     ELI
                              (indicating pistol; 
                              continuing from 
                              Corinthians 6:17)
                         "And touch not the unclean thing!"

               His intensity tinged with righteous anger, he is hugely 
               impressive.

               EXT. WASHHOUSE  NEAR KITCHEN  NIGHT 

               Book stands near the door to the kitchen, and has heard most 
               or all of Eli's words. He turns, and painfully makes his way 
               into the washhouse, moving quietly, hoping no one will come 
               out from the kitchen.

               EXT. BARN  LAPP FARM  DAY

               Samuel harnesses up the family mare, and backs her into the 
               traces of the buggy.

               INT. BOOK'S BEDROOM  DAY

               Book stands at the window in a worn robe. Below, through the 
               window, we can see Samuel and Eli in the barnyard. A beat, 
               then Book crosses impatiently back to his bed, sits down, 
               picks up a dog-earred copy of The American Dairyman. There's 
               a stack of well-thumbed farm magazines and copies of The 
               Budget (the Amish newspaper) on the bedside table.

               There's a knock. Rachel enters carrying a pile of clothing. 
               She smiles.

                                     RACHEL
                         Enjoying your reading?

                              (eyes the clothing)
                         What's that?

                         soaking.You can wear these.

               She passes the clothes to Book.

                         Your husband's?

                         Yes. It's good that someone can have 
                         the use of them. Besides, in your 
                         clothes you'd stand out to strangers.

               She continues, cheerfully.

                                     RACHEL
                         I should tell you these do not have

                         Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.

                         Driving by all the time. Some even 
                         come into the yard. Very rude. They 
                         seem to think we are quaint.

                                     BOOK
                         Quaint? Can't imagine why.

               She smiles.

               Rachel's face clouds.

                         for a while.

                         You can go with Eli. He's taking 
                         Samuel to school. But you'll have to 
                         hurry.

               Rachel turns to leave when Book calls her back.

               She turns to look at him. It's the first time he's used her 
               name.

                                     BOOK
                         Thanks.

               She smiles and leaves.

               EXT. FARMHOUSE  DAY

               Eli calls impatiently from the buggy. Samuel sits beside 
               him.

                                     ELI
                         Hurry up now, John Book!

               INT. KITCHEN  DAY

               Rachel washing dishes turns on hearing Book enter. She laughs 
               out loud at the sight of him in his Amish gear, and rightly 
               so  the pants are highwater, the hat low-rise, the jacket 
               ill-fitting.

               Book looks self-conscious, even a little sheepish.

               Outside another SHOUT from Eli.

                                     RACHEL
                         You'd better go.

               Book looks embarrassed.

                                     BOOK
                         My... eh... gun?

               The smile fades from Rachel's face as she reaches up into a 
               cupboard. She passes the gun in its holster to Book. He 
               fastens it about him. The contradiction of an "Armed Amishman" 
               increases the awkwardness between them. Book turns his back 
               to her and checks the weapon. He turns back to her smiling 
               in an odd way.

                                     BOOK
                         The... bullets?

                                     RACHEL
                         Oh. The bullets.

               She takes them out of a disused coffee jar, passes them to 
               Book.

                                     BOOK
                              (attempting a joke)
                         Not much good without them.

               INT. BUGGY  COUNTRY ROAD  DAY

               Samuel sits between Eli and Book. Both men stare straight 
               ahead.

               Eli looks particularly stern. It's pretty clear he doesn't 
               like this Englishman wearing the clothes of his faith.

               EXT. AMISH ONE-TEACHER-SCHOOL  DAY

               With awave Samuel runs into the schoolyard to join his 
               friends. A teacher begins ringing a bell.

               INT. STORE  SALTZBURG

               Book on the telephone waiting for his call to be answered. 
               He looks about him  several Amish and Dithers mingle in the 
               shop.

               Book-has gotten a coke from a machine, seems a bit self-
               conscious shout it sips at it surreptitiously... A voice 
               comes on the line; it's that of Book's partner.

                                     CARTER
                         Yeah?

               A silence.

                                     BOOK
                         It's me.

                                     CARTER

                         I'm coming.

                                     CARTER
                         Listen, Johnny, don't do anything 
                         stupid. You couldn't get within a 
                         mile of Schaeffer right now. So stay 
                         put... Stay in touch  I'll let you 
                         know when maybe it makes sense.

               A beat as Book considers that.

                                     CARTER
                              (edgily)
                         You hear me?

                              (finally)
                         I hear you. I'll stay in touch.

                                     CARTER
                         That's more like it.
                              (and)
                         Where are you at, anyway?

               Book allows himself a small smile, regarding his Amish image 
               reflected in the window of the store.

                                     BOOK
                         Where I'm at is maybe 1890.

                                     CARTER
                              (uncomprehending)
                         Say again?

                                     BOOK
                         Make that 1790.

               He hangs up. A beat, then he stares toward the door of the 
               store.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               Book works on his car. The battery has gone flat and he's 
               trying to charge it up by running wires to a battery mounted 
               under the front seat of the Lapp buggy.

               Eli stands at the barn door staring at him, again the 
               disapproving look.

                         thing, you can do work for me.

               Book is genuinely apologetic.

                         Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind 
                         me plugging in to your battery. Mine's 
                         dead... How can I help? What can I 
                         do?

               lamp.

               He pauses a moment to peer at the sleeping figure with 
               undisguised anticipation. Then he gives him a jarring thump:

                                     ELI
                              (briskly)
                         Veck oufl. Time for milking.

               Book comes groggily awake as Eli exits. He gropes for his 
               watch.

               As the milk herd of half dozen or so cows ambles in with 
               Samuel prodding them along, headed for the milking stalls. 
               Book looks on in the lamplight, nonplused.

               SAMUEL

               Where he's pitching hay into the cow's feed-troughs.

               BOOK, ELI

               Where the old man is showing Book how to milk a cow by hand. 
               We see Rachel watching from the milkhouse door (steam from 
               scalding milk cans rising behind her).

                                     ELI
                         Good, firm twist and pull, eh?
                              (and)
                         Right. Now you try it.

               Book gives him a look, takes over the milking stool. The cow 
               shoots him a rather skeptical look over her shoulder. Book 
               bends to his task.

                                     ELI
                         Didn't you hear me, Book? Pull! You 
                         never had your hands on a teat before?

               Eli unexpectedly finds this hilarious, cackles, gives Book a 
               comradely, man-of-the-world thump on the shoulder that jars 
               him.

               Then he moves off. Book bends to his task, and...

               ANGLE  RACHEL

               Grinning, giggling, covering her mouth with one hand.

               milk can.

               Something in him can't help but respond to the beauty.

               A beat, then he blows on his hands, rubs them briskly together 
               against the morning chill, and turns back to the barn.

               EXT. LAPP FARMHOUSE  DAY

               It is later in the morning. Rachel comes out onto the porch, 
               tosses a pan of dirty dishwater off onto the grass, looks 
               toward the barn.

               ANGLE  THE BARN

               Eli and Book standing in one of the open doorways, looking

               ANGLE FAVORING Luke, one of Eli's team of fine mules as Samuel 
               opens the stall gate. The beast is skittish, obviously 
               afflicted with something of a behavioral problem.

               But he allows Samuel to lead him out.

               BOOK, ELI

               As Samuel brings Luke out. Eli is now harnessing the other 
               mule of the team to a large manure-spreader. But as Luke 
               nears Book, his eyes widen and he shies, almost hauling Samuel 
               off his feet.

               Book moves to Samuel's aid; a gesture which proves a serious 
               mistake. Luke erupts into a SCREAMING, bucking cyclone. Samuel 
                who no doubt has been here before  dives nimbly for cover 
               as a flying hoof nearly takes Book's head off.

               Then Eli hustles into the fray, pushing Book aside as he 
               BELLOWS belligerently in German at the rearing animal. Finally 
               he gives Luke a swat upside the head that seems, somehow, to 
               have the effect of quieting the beast instantly.

               Samuel gives the shaken Book a look:

                         That's Luke. He doesn't like 
                         strangers.

               Eli leads the pacified mule back to the traces, grunting at 
               Book.

               knocked down the day of his attempted departure. He pauses 
               as a figure approaches. We recognize Daniel Hochstetler, 
               Rachel's would-be suitor. He heads for Book with an outgoing 
               smile and outstretched hand. Here's a likable man who likes 
               people.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         Good morning. Book, is it? You are 
                         the Yankee they talk about?

                         English, Yankee. It's the same. My 
                         name is Daniel. Daniel Hochstetler.

                         You look plain, Book.
                              (grinning)
                         Very plain.

               Book is not particularly amused.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         I came to see Rachel Lapp.

                         Try the house.

               Hochstetler gives Book a powerful clap on the shoulder.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                              (genially)
                         You bet. you take care of yourself.

               Hochstetler heads for the house. Book stares after him with 
               some interest.

               As Rachel emerges from the house to greet him. She also 
               catches sight of Book and she pauses, a shadow of confusion 
               crossing her expression for an instant.

               And Hochstetler doesn't miss it either.

               Then she gives her suitor a genuine smile of welcome.

               HOG PENS

               Book, having gathered up the pieces of the bird house, is 
               headed toward the outbuildings, passing by hog pens. He 
               glances toward the house:

               Where Rachel and Hochstetler are sitting in a porch swing, 
               sharing a pitcher of lemonade.

               Thoughtful... He glances at the hog pen as a huge sow SQUEALS 
               and angrily noses her young ones away from the trough so she 
               can feed.

               Book swallows that one. With difficulty. Rachel intervenes:

                         Not long... A few days.

               Another beat as Rachel watches him... Book, checking out the 
               battery power, hits the radio  and suddenly from the 
               Twentieth Century comes the sound of one of its major 
               inventions  rock and roll.

               It fills the barn, but Book turns up the volume a click more 
               even and, eyeing Rachel, starts moving with the beat. It's 
               his culture, coming through loud and clear, as incongruous 
               as it all might seem with the tough Philly cop decked out in 
               Amish.

               Rachel can't help but laugh... Sensing her response, Book 
               sweeps her up and they boogie in the lamplight, Rachel 
               alternately protesting and laughing.

                                     BOOK
                         You like it... Don't you?

               Rachel, confused, protests:

                                     RACHEL
                         No... You just stop 

               But she doesn't really want to. Book grins:

                                     BOOK
                              (mock alarm)
                         Next thing you know you'll be off 
                         drinking beer and racing motorcycles.

               And it goes on... Rachel alternately protesting and laughing.

               ANGLE  THE BARN DOOR

               As Eli suddenly appears. He glowers for an instant, 
               thunderstruck, then BELLOWS:

                                     ELI
                         Rachel!

               THE SCENE

               As Book and Rachel's dancing comes to a sudden halt. Both 
               turn, look at Eli. Rachel regards him level-eyed, without 
               discernible alarm. Book, looking a bit sheepish, goes over, 
               turns off the radio, as:

                                     ELI
                              (in the dialect)
                         What is this? This Myusick?

               Book hesitates, then starts to say something:

                                     BOOK
                         It's not her fault. I 

               But he gets such a look from Eli that he turns, goes out.

                                     ELI
                              (in the dialect)
                         How can this be? How can you do such 
                         a thing? Is this plain? Is this the 
                         ordnung?

                                     RACHEL
                         I have done nothing against the 
                         ordnung.

                                     ELI
                              (in the dialect)
                         Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this 
                         man to our house. With his gun of 
                         the hand. You bring fear to this 
                         house. Fear of English with guns 
                         coming after. You bring blood and 
                         whispers of more blood. Now English 
                         music... and you are dancing to 
                         English music! And you call this 
                         nothing?

                                     RACHEL
                         I have committed no sin.

                                     ELI
                              (in English)
                         No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, 
                         it does not look...
                              (tone softening... in 
                              the dialect)
                         Don't you know there has been talk? 
                         Talk about you, not him. Talk about 
                         going to the Bishop. About having 
                         you... shunned!

                                     RACHEL
                         That is idle talk.

                                     ELI
                              (in English, pleading)
                         Do not make light of it, Rachel. 
                         They can do it... quick! Like that! 
                         And then... then I can not sit at 
                         table with you. I can not take a 
                         thing from your hand. I... I can not 
                         go with you to meeting!
                              (the old man almost 
                              breaks down as, in 
                              the dialect)
                         Rachel, good Rachel, you must not go 
                         too far! Dear child!

               Rachel is annoyed  also touched, no doubt, by the old man's 
               plea  but irked by his condescending tone.

                                     RACHEL
                         I am not a child.

                                     ELI
                              (suddenly stern again)
                         You are acting like one!

                                     RACHEL
                         I will be the judge of that.

                                     ELI
                              (fierce as a prophet)
                         No! They will be the judge of that! 
                         And so will I... if you shame me!

                                     RACHEL
                              (blinking a tear now, 
                              but meeting his gaze)
                         You shame yourself.

               And shaken  but proud and erect  she turns and walks out.

               INT. SCHAEFFER'S OFFICE  NIGHT

               Carter sits, Schaeffer prowls... slowly, letting silences 
               grow before he strikes again with another softly-snarled 
               question or statement.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You know where he is.

                                     CARTER
                         Wrong.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You'd lie to protect him.

                                     CARTER
                              (cool)
                         Probably.

               Schaeffer snaps around, glares at him.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You admit you're lying?

                                     CARTER
                              (shakes head)
                         I admit I don't know where he is.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You're the first one he'll contact.

                                     CARTER
                              (sighing)
                         He's got my number.

               Schaeffer stops, stands in front of Carter, takes a deep 
               breath... suddenly smiles. And is abruptly (as he is capable 
               of being) the man of charm and gentlemanly reason. He even 
               CHUCKLES as he begins:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         It's funny. I know he's hiding 
                         somewhere with the Amish, I know it.
                              (a quick glance at 
                              Carter)
                         Can you imagine John Book at a prayer 
                         meeting? Our John Book?

               Schaeffer CHUCKLES again, looks hopefully again at Carter.

               Carter looks back, stony-eyed. Schaeffer makes another abrupt 
               shift in form... but still speaks softly.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Either you're a member of the club 
                         or you aren't, Elton.
                              (he nods his head, as)
                         Tell me what you know...

                                     CARTER
                         What I know, Paul, is...
                              (nodding his head)
                         He's going to take you out...

               EXT. LAPP FARM  LANCASTER COUNTY  DAY

               As Book pauses by the barn door, glances over his shoulder.

               HIS POV  BUGGY

               With trace horse harnessed... Samuel and Eli loading 
               provisions into the buggy, standing down by the house.

               BACK TO BOOK  INT. / EXT. BARN

               As he goes into the barn.

               Book approaches Luke's stall warily... and as he does so the 
               temperamental mule, reacting to form, starts to skitter, his 
               hooves CRACKING against the walls of the stall. Book flinches.

               Book starts to talk gently to the animal:

                                     BOOK
                         All right, you nasty son of a bitch, 
                         we're going to be friends whether 
                         you like it or not.

               Then, summoning his resolve, he carefully opens the stall 
               gate.

               ANGLE

               As Luke eyes him balefully, Book reaches into his pocket, 
               brings out some lumps of sugar.

                                     BOOK
                         See... Sugar. You like sugar, don't 
                         you for Christ's sake?

               Finally, keeping a mistrustful eye on Book, Luke condescends 
               to eat. Book nods with satisfaction.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Rachel has entered the barn, is watching Book with a puzzled 
               expression.

                                     RACHEL
                              (surprised)
                         Well...

               Book turns, grins with some pride of accomplishment!

                                     BOOK
                         Won him over just like that.

                                     RACHEL
                         I see.
                              (and)
                         But I hope you have a lot of sugar.
                              (then, going)
                         Eli is ready to go to Zook's.

               Just then Luke skitters impatiently... Book gives him a 
               nervous look; one last tentative pat as Luke eyes him 
               skeptically, then closes the stall gate and turns to go:

                                     BOOK
                         Later.

               And we...

               EXT. ZOOK FARM  LANCASTER COUNTY  DAY

               BIG SHOT... it's early morning as the Amish buggies are 
               arriving at the Zook farm for a barn-raising.

               In the b.g. we can see big stacks of lumber all around the 
               construction site where a couple of dozen men have begun 
               raising the main supports on the already laid foundation.

               Elsewhere, long tables have been set up and women are 
               spreading them with cloths, setting out big tanks of hot 
               coffee and cold lemonade for the men,

               LAPP BUGGY

               As Eli, Book, Rachel and Samuel step down, Book eyes the 
               construction site.

                                     ELI
                         Wait here 'til I find a gang you can 
                         work with.

               He goes. Book glances around as even more buggies arrive and 
               more workmen and their families climb out.

               Eli appears with Hochstetler in tow. Hochstetler's broad 
               face breaks into a grin:

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         Book! Good to see you!

               He pumps Book's hand with his usual vigor, smiling a greeting 
               and pleasantry to Rachel. She looks on, amused.

               Hochstetler gives Rachel a look, and we realize that his 
               showing up just now to appropriate Book was no happenstance.

               And Book realizes it as well.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.

                                     BOOK
                         It's been a while.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         No matter. Come with me. We can always 
                         use a good carpenter.

               With that he throws a huge arm around Book's shoulder and 
               ushers him away. Rachel calls after them:

                                     RACHEL
                         Good luck.

               BOOK / HOCHSTETLER

               As they move off.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         Your hole is healed, then?

                                     BOOK
                              (gives him a look)
                         Pretty much.

               Hochstetler nods with satisfaction:

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         Good. Then you can go home.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               CUTS

               As the morning progresses:

               ...Book and Hochstetler sawing and augering out heavy timbers 
               on big sawhorses. There's an unmistakable atmosphere of 
               competition between the two men, which doesn't go entirely 
               unnoticed by the half-dozen or so other young men on the 
               gang.

               ...or, indeed, by Rachel; in fact, she seems  without leaning 
               on it too heavily  to be measuring the two men as the morning 
               progresses, and she occasionally passes within proximity of 
               them.

               ...Eli and a couple of other elders prowling the job with 
               sheaves of hand-drawn sketches under their arms, supervising 
               the construction. All around them the structure is rising 
               with remarkable rapidity.

               ...Rachel, where she's helping the women set out the huge 
               noon meal. Other women are sitting on benches in the b.g., 
               knitting or doing quiltwork.

               ...Samuel, where he's banging away with a hammer, with a 
               group of boys his own age. Elsewhere we see little girls 
               "botching" (a hand-clapping game played to German rhymes).

               ...The very elderly; sitting on the grass or in wheelchairs 
               in the sunlight, looking on  the old men kibitzing in German, 
               the women gossiping.

               Until...

               BIG SHOT

               Of the barn-raising with the noon sun high overhead... at 
               least a hundred and fifty men are swarming over and about 
               the barn framework...

               ...some aid the rafters, some hauling lumber to the job, 
               others sawing, hammering, drilling, joining, planing and 
               what-all... so many that the barn seems almost to be rearing 
               up before our very eyes. And there isn't a power tool in 
               sight.

               WOMEN'S AREA

               As Rachel crosses near the benches... we can see other women 
               eyeing her, whispering among themselves, some tittering. 
               Rachel ignores them.

               She joins the stoutly amiable Mrs. Yoder from the funeral 
               sequence earlier. The older woman is emptying a big pan of 
               fried chicken into serving platters. She smiles, obviously 
               liking Rachel.

                                     MRS. YODER
                         Everyone has an idea about you and 
                         the English.

                                     RACHEL
                         All of them charitable, I'm sure.

                                     MRS. YODER
                         Hardly any of them.

               ANGLE  THE ROOFBEAM

               Book and Hochstetler astride the roofbeam studs, holding 
               them together prior to nailing them to the roof-beam. They 
               are, therefore, crotch to the mast and facing one another, 
               way out at the far end of the roof.

               Suddenly, as Hochstetler raises his hammer, the studs start 
               to part, threatening to de-ball the both of them.

               Hochstetler drops his hammer, grabs both sides of the roof 
               with incredible brute strength, and, literally, pulls it 
               back together.

               Book stares at Hochstetler with nothing short of awe.

               Hochstetler, straining and grinning, looks to Book:

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         Nail it!

                                     BOOK
                         Yes, sir.

               And he does nail it while Hochstetler, grinning and holding, 
               looks on.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               BIG SHOT

               The barn is done, the workmen climbing down from the rafters. 
               It's late afternoon.

               ANGLE ON BOOK

               He hesitates. His face is pale and covered with sweat. The 
               exertion of the day has taken its toll. He's in danger of 
               fainting and is some forty feet above the ground. But he's 
               determined it won't happen, determined that he won't fall, 
               nor will he humiliate himself by calling for help. Hochstetler 
               guesses the situation. He moves beside Book, claps an arm 
               about him, says nothing, doesn't even look at Book. From 
               below, someone TELLS them to hurry up.

               Hochstetler shouts:

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         We admire our work!

               The moment passes for Book, and he's okay. Hochstetler removes 
               his supporting arm. Book looks him in the eye, nods his 
               appreciation almost imperceptibly. Hochstetler wants no 
               thanks, and Book knows it. Hochstetler gives him a resounding 
               SLAP on the back, and starts climbing down. Book follows.

               EXT. ZOOK FARM  LANCASTER COUNTY  EVENING

               The gathering has congregated to hear Bishop Tschantz offer 
               up a blessing on the new barn.

               CONGREGATION

               PANNING the faces as they listen to the heavy German words 
               rolling out over the still evening air.

               Book stands a little to one side of the Amish. The prayers 
               he cannot share with them. Rachel is aware of this, feels 
               something of his emotion. She looks toward him, then she too 
               closes her eyes and drifts away from him, into the soothing 
               prayer.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LAPP FARM  NIGHT

               Book stands outside, listening to the NIGHT SOUNDS. He turns, 
               walks up toward the porch.

               EXT. PORCH  TARP FARMHOUSE  NIGHT

               Book takes a seat in a chair, SIGHS, looks toward the night 
               sky.

               There is a SOUND, but it's a moment before he turns his eyes 
               toward the door.

               ANGLE  THE DOOR

               Samuel standing there in his nightshirt.

               BACK TO SCENE

               As Book leans forward in his chair.

                                     BOOK
                         Hey, Sam...

                                     SAMUEL
                         ...I want to say a thing.

                                     BOOK
                              (sitting up)
                         What's that, Sam?

               The boy hesitates, holds for a time, then suddenly darts 
               across to Book, wraps his arms around him, hugs him tightly... 
               then breaks away, turns and runs hack into the house, leaving 
               the door open behind him.

               ANGLE  BOOK

               Looking after the boy, genuinely moved. After a moment, he 
               speaks softly:

                                     BOOK
                         Same to you, Sam.

               After another moment, he gets up, moves to close the door 
               that Samuel has left open behind him.

               ANOTHER ANGLE  BOOK

               From the lighted/shadowed area outside the door. He comes to 
               the door, starts to close it, then hesitates, looks into see 
               where the light is coming from. He looks down the corridor. 
               The light is obviously coming from the kitchen. He speaks 
               softly:

                                     BOOK
                         Sam?

               No answer. Book steps inside, pulls the door shut behind 
               him, moves down-the corridor toward the kitchen.

               INT. LAPP WASHHOUSE  NIGHT

               Where Rachel, dressed only in a plain cotton camisole, is 
               pouring a pail of steaming water into a tub.

               She replaces the pail on the stove, turns and slips out of 
               her camisole. Naked, she folds the garment across the back 
               of a chair.

               Then she pauses, containing a startled intake of breath.

               RACHEL'S POV  FRYING PAN

               The gleaming bottom of a large copper skillet hanging over 
               the stove with other cookware, we can see Book's image 
               reflected there, framed in the kitchen doorway.

               BACK TO SCENE

               Rachel hesitates for a moment  and in that moment she makes 
               a choice.

               Slowly she turns, to face him, without shame, meeting his 
               eyes.

               And for a moment she attempts something: a look, a flash of 
               eve... a lovely, heartbreakingly innocent effort to become, 
               for an instant, a woman of Book's world.

               BOOK

               As he stands in the doorway, willing himself to leave, unable 
               to make it happen.

               And suddenly the moment has passed. Rachel lowers her eyes, 
               picks up the camisole, covers herself with it without putting 
               it on, looks away.

               BOOK

               TIGHTENING to him, and...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANGLE  HEN YARD

               Where Rachel is scattering feed to the chickens.

               A beat, then Book approaches from behind her. A moment, as 
               she senses his presence.

               Book watches as Rachel begins to gather the eggs, placing 
               them in the fold of her apron.

               When he speaks, he speaks softly, and she pauses in her work.

                                     BOOK
                         Last night.

               She goes very still, but keeps her back to him.

                                     BOOK
                         If... we'd made love, then, I couldn't 
                         leave.

               She lowers her head slightly, but remains turned away from 
               him.

               Book continues to stare at her.

               EXT. RURAL ROAD  LANCASTER COUNTY  DAY

               The Lapp carriage on a winding lane.

               INT. BUGGY (MOVING)

               Rachel is driving, Book sitting next to her. Samuel is in 
               the back, looking out the rear window and not paying any 
               attention to the adults.

               A beat, then a large produce truck roars past them. It's all 
               Book can do to keep from flinching.

               Rachel stares straight ahead. Book glances at her.

                                     BOOK
                         Maybe I ought to learn to drive this 
                         thing.

               Rachel says nothing.

                                     BOOK
                              (beat)
                         Pick myself up another useful skill.

               Now Rachel can't help but smile. She looks at him. And...

               EXT. ANGLE

               We can see the Lapp buggy approaching a rural intersection, 
               another buggy approaching at right angles.

               INT. LAPP BUGGY

               As Rachel eyes the other buggy through the windshield.

                                     RACHEL
                         Samuel, who is that?

               Samuel checks out the buggy.

                                     SAMUEL
                         It looks like Hochstetler's mare.

               EXT. ANGLE

               As the Lapp buggy passes the intersection and the Hochstetler 
               buggy swings in behind them. Then the Hochstetler buggy, 
               coming on at a faster clip, starts to pass the Lapp buggy.

               INT. LAPP BUGGY

               As Rachel waves at the occupants of the other buggy; Daniel 
               returns her greeting:

                                     BOOK
                              (teasing her)
                         Uh oh, they're leaving us behind.

               Rachel gives him a look, and... gives the reins a flick  
               the race is on.

               RACE MONTAGE

               Hochstetler has a couple of older folk on board, together 
               with his young sister  at first they're not aware of the 
               race, until Daniel can contain his excitement no longer and 
               gives his horse a couple of whoops. The buggies are neck and 
               neck, and the older people are not protesting loudly.

               It's all Book can do to refrain from grabbing the reins off 
               Rachel, but she's something of a horsewoman and finally she 
               gains the edge and pulls ahead of Hochstetler, to the cheers 
               of Samuel and Book.

               EXT. SALZBURGSTORE  DAY

               It's a Saturday afternoon in the tourist season, and they're 
               everywhere  taking shots of anything Amish. There's a ROWDY 
               YOUNG ELEMENT amongst them who are making their presence 
               fast, and generally making a nuisance of themselves.

               Book and Rachel get out of the buggy. Samuel stays inside; 
               the crowds make him nervous. A huge tourist bus billowing 
               smoke pulls up nearby.

               Rachel enters the store, but before Book can follow he's 
               stopped by a TOURIST LADY with an instamatic camera... She 
               waggles the camera at him...

                                     TOURIST LADY
                         Could I... ah, you know?

                              (smiling)
                         Lady, if you take my picture, I'll 
                         rip your brassiere off and strangle 
                         you with it.

               The Tourist Lady stares at him in stunned disbelief, her 
               grin frozen on her face. Then she begins to scuttle back 
               from whence she came.

               INT. STORE

               Rachel is browsing among the stocked shelves in the company 
               of a young Amish woman, Ellie Beiler. Rachel is carrying 
               Ellie's tiny baby, and the infant is getting as much attention 
               as the shopping.

               Book is standing at a wall pay phone in the b.g. We TIGHTEN 
               to him, and...

                         Lieutenant Elton Carter, please.

               A beat, then we hear the FILTERED VOICE of the Philadelphia 
               Police Department switchboard:

                                     VOICE

                         I'm sorry. Last night Sergeant Carter 
                         was killed in the line of duty...

               Book hangs up. His breathing is thrown out by the shock of 
               the news and he takes a couple of deep breaths to regain 
               control. He hesitates, unsure of his next move. He makes to 
               move away, then he turns back, finds more coins and dials a 
               second number.

               Schaeffer's wife answers the phone; she is momentarily

               She calls for her husband, then makes polite conversation.

                         How are you, John?

               Paul Schaeffer appears, slightly irritated at being called 
               away from the Saturday afternoon game.

                                     MRS. SCHAEFFER
                              (covering mouthpiece)
                         John Book!

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         I'll take it in the study.

               INT. STUDY / STORE  DAY

               Schaeffer takes the phone.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You can hang up, dear.

               We HEAR the click of the other phone,

                                     BOOK
                         You made a mistake, Paul. You 
                         shouldn't have taken Elton out.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (beat)
                         How bad did Mac get you? We figured 
                         pretty bad.

                                     BOOK
                         I'm fine. I'm going to live a long 
                         time. That's what I called to tell 
                         you.

                                     SCHAEFFER

                         Johnny 

                                     BOOK
                         You might want to pass it along to 
                         Mac.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (urgently)
                         Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're 
                         out there all alone... We're getting 
                         close... real close... Maybe if you 
                         listen to me for a minute we can 
                         work something out so you can come 
                         in 

                                     BOOK
                         I've already got something worked 
                         out.
                              (and)
                         Be seeing you.

               Book hangs up the phone and the dead CLICK registers on 
               Schaeffer.

               Book has gripped the phone so tightly that it takes a second 
               to unclench his fist. Then it takes something else to resist 
               his first impulse, which is to smash out at something... 
               Training. Get it under control. Deal rationally with the 
               situation.

               He straightens his jacket, wipes the sweat/tears from his 
               eyes, turns and walks stiffly out of the Saltzburg General 
               Store.

               INT. BUGGY  MAIN STREET  SALTZBURG  DAY

               Book, as Rachel eyes him. She has noticed his changed mood, 
               but doesn't ask about it. He stares straight ahead, oblivious 
               to the surroundings of the street, now crawling with tourists 
               and traffic.

               EXT. NARROW SIDE STREET  SALTZBURG  DAY

               The buggy turns into the side street. Some hundred yards 
               ahead another buggy is stopped in the middle of the road  
               several youths gathered about it. A pickup truck is stopped, 
               facing the buggy.

               INT. LAPP BUGGY  DAY

               As Rachel approaches the scene, slowing down and finally 
               stopping.

               Rachel is at first puzzled, then makes a small face, looks 
               at Book.

               Rachel puts a restraining hand on Book's arm.

                                     RACHEL
                         Do nothing. This happens from time 
                         to time.

               She senses him about to get out, grips his arm tightly.

                                     RACHEL
                         It's not our way, John. We'll have 
                         nothing to do with violence! John!

               Book shakes free, gets out and slowly walks toward the...

               EXT. HOCHSTETLER'S BUGGY  DAY

               Hochstetler and his family sit, impassive, ignoring various 
               jeers and taunts from the English lads  various jokes about 
               them being dirty etc. One jabs an ice cream cone into 
               Hochstetler's forehead, which leaves a curious white circle 
               on his forehead. Another fools about with the horse causing 
               it to shy. A third notices the slow, sure, approach of John 
               Book.

                                     YOUTH
                         Here comes another one!

               Book stops, his path blocked by the third youth. The youth 
               flicks off Book's hat.

                                     BOOK
                              (quietly)
                         You're making a mistake.

               Hochstetler calls from his buggy.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         Everything is all right, John.

                                     BOOK
                              (to the youth)
                         Pick up the hat.

               The youth momentarily unsure  something about Book's tone 
               of voice. The youth does pick up the hat, crumples it, stamps 
               on it, and puts it back at a crazy angle on Book's head. A 
               pause, then Book explodes.

               The kid never knew what hit him or where it came from, he 
               hits the road surface already unconscious. A second youth 
               grabs Book from behind. A mistake. Book is smashing into 
               him, spatters of blood from his nose flying in all directions. 
               He's hitting too hard, too often. It's Schaeffer he's hitting. 
               Hochstetler is pulling him away, Rachel is there too. A crowd 
               is gathering, but as suddenly as it began it's over. Book 
               shakes Hochstetler off him, straightens his hat, and in a 
               kind of daze, begins walking past the scene in the direction 
               of the Lapp farm.

               The youths are picking up their wounded, helping them back 
               to their truck, aided by none other than Hochstetler. An OLD 
               LOCAL addresses Rachel.

                                     LOCAL MAN
                         Never seen anything like that in all

                                     RACHEL
                         John, lost control of himself. He... 
                         will be repentant.

                              (to Rachel)
                         You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?

                                     RACHEL
                         Yes. Samuel! We're going.

               A second man calls from the pickup.

                                     SECOND MAN
                         Kid's nose is broken!

                                     LOCAL MAN
                         We'll take him up the hospital. Good-
                         day to you, Mrs. Lapp.
                              (he shouts after her)
                         This ain't good for the tourist trade, 
                         you know! You tell that to your Ohio 
                         cousin!

               But Rachel is already steering past the scene and following 
               the by now distant figure of John Book.

               EXT. BARN / CARPENTER'S SHOP  DUSK

               Book comes out of the carpenter's shop carrying the repaired 
               birdhouse on its pole in one hand, a shovel in the other.

               Rachel is shepherding the milking cows toward the barn.

                                     RACHEL
                         You should not bother with that 
                         birdhouse.
                              (a beat)
                         If you're leaving tomorrow.

                                     BOOK
                         I'm leaving tonight.
                              (and)
                         I'm going to need my clothes. And my 
                         gun.

               She nods, looks away... looks back at him twice in glances. 
               There is a moment when it appears she might either bark at 
               him or begin to weep. He waits. When she does turn to him, 
               she speaks softly:

                                     RACHEL
                         There was a time when I thought you 
                         might have stayed.

                                     BOOK
                              (hesitating... then)
                         There was.

                                     RACHEL
                         There was a time when I would have 
                         welcomed it.

                              (after a beat)
                         I know.

                                     RACHEL
                              (asking)
                         I was being foolish?

                                     BOOK
                         No.
                              (and)
                         I was being unrealistic. Even thinking 
                         about living this life.

                                     RACHEL
                         You're so sure of that?

                              rising a bit, annoyed)
                         I'm not so sure of anything as you 
                         are, John Book. You could live this 
                         life if you wanted to bad enough.

                         There is always a way! But you are 
                         such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot 
                         see! You'd rather go back to that 
                         city! To nothing! No woman! No

                         That's God's way!

                                     BOOK
                         Well in the City of Philadelphia, 
                         God needs a little help!

               He has offended her, immediately knows it, but can't bring 
               himself to make an instant apology. But he's chewing on it 
               when she takes the moment unto herself. She pulls herself 
               up, speaks with great dignity:

                                     RACHEL
                         I could never love a man who was 
                         so... little.

               He looks at her, sad-eyed, his anger ebbing and gone, 
               realizing that he'll never meet a finer woman... never even 
               get close to such a one. He appears to start to speak, but 
               then does not.

               She turns, moves away a few steps, stops, looks back at him. 
               she holds for a moment, blinking tears, then speaks with 
               some difficulty, emotion welling in her words.

                                     RACHEL
                         The other night... when you saw me 
                         after my bath... I... I tried to 
                         look as I thought you would want a 
                         woman to look.
                              (sadly... but with a 
                              slight, proud lift 
                              of chin)
                         I am sorry... that I did not.

               She holds for an instant, then turns and walks off.

               Looking after her. A face full of loss.

               INT. KITCHEN  DUSK

               Eli is lighting the lamps. Samuel reads a book at the kitchen 
               table. Rachel moves slowly to the sink and begins washing a 
               few dishes. She looks out the window.

               CLOSE on her face, a strange expression.

               INT. / EXT RACHEL'S POV  DUSK

               The distant figure of Book working on the birdhouse.

               INT. KITCHEN

               CLOSE on Rachel's hands, lifting items slowly up and of the 
               water to the draining board, where she places them carefully 
               down. She shakes the water off her hands.

               CLOSE on her face, still staring fixedly out the window. She 
               speaks without turning around.

                                     RACHEL
                         Eli, would you see Samuel to bed?

               The old man glances at her; this is not their routine.

               EXT. DRIVEWAY  DUSK

               In the rapidly fading light, Rachel walks slowly toward Book.

               CLOSE on her face, staring straight ahead toward Book.

               ANGLE on Book, CLOSE. He turns and watches Rachel's approach.

               BIG WIDE ANGLE

               The light now nearly gone, the NIGHT SOUNDS beginning, as 
               Rachel reaches Book and they embrace.

               EXT. FIELD BY ROAD  NIGHT

               Book and Rachel in a passionate embrace, sink to the still 
               warm earth and make love.

               EXT. SOUDERSBURG CAFE  LANCASTER COUNTY  NIGHT

               ESTABLISHING an all-night cafe in the early hours of the 
               morning.

               TIGHTENING to the bleakly lighted windows.

               INT. CARE

               A booth, where Schaeffer and McElroy and Fergie, a Lancaster 
               County Undersheriff and his SHERIFF  an expansive politician 
               type  are seated.

               The Undersheriff eyes Schaeffer narrowly. The Sheriff has a 
               county map spread out on the table, amid breakfast dishes, 
               pointing directions to Schaeffer:

                                     SHERIFF
                         There... White Oak Road a couple of 
                         miles before it ties into two-twenty-
                         two. Got it?

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Got it. We owe you one, Sheriff.

                                     SHERIFF
                         My man Holmes here put it together. 
                         Fine officer, Chief. He spoke to the 
                         doctor at the hospital.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Undersheriff Holmes and I have talked 
                         on the phone.
                              (nods at Holmes)
                         Good work.

                                     UNDERSHERIFF
                         Sure you don't want us to post some 
                         backup units?

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         If we need any help, we'll give you 
                         a shout. I'd like to slip in there 
                         quiet, then get out before we attract 
                         any attention.

               EXT. CAFE PORCH  DAY

               As Schaeffer and his men are climbing into their car. Holmes 
               and the Sheriff watch after them.

                                     HOLMES
                         Maybe I'll take a drive over that 
                         way.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Let 'em be. It's their dirty laundry.

               But Holmes pauses to watch Schaeffer's car pull out.

               EXT. RURAL LANE  LANCASTER COUNTY  DAWN

               With the first light of dawn on the eastern horizon, 
               Schaeffer's car approaches along the lane, pulls into the 
               Lapp driveway and comes to a halt.

               In the b.g. we can make out the farmhouse and outbuildings.

               HOLD as Schaeffer, McElroy and Fergie step out of the car. 
               They break out short-barreled twelve-gauge pumps, start TOWARD 
               CAMERA, spreading out as they turn up the long driveway... 
               figures of ominous intent striding through the misty dawn.

               ANGLE

               GOING WITH the trio of gunmen... McElroy, breath smoking in 
               the chill, eyes the terrain:

                                     MCELROY
                         Weird, man. No fuckin' electricity. 
                         What do you figure they plug all 
                         their shit into?

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         They don't have any shit.

               INT. KITCHEN  DAWN

               Where Eli is getting into a heavy coat, preparing to go out... 
               the remains of the hearty morning breakfast are on the table. 
               Rachel is beginning the dishes.

               INT. BARN  DAWN

               Book and Samuel are starting the morning milking...

               INT. KITCHEN  DAWN

               Eli is preparing to extinguish the lamp when suddenly the 
               kitchen door is kicked open and McElroy and Fergie weapons 
               leveled, burst in. Eli reacts with angry shock as Schaeffer 
               enters: Rachel is, for a moment, terrified.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (to Fergie)
                         Outside 
                              (to Mac)
                         Check out the rest of the house.

               He turns to Eli, who is standing in the middle of the room.

               Schaeffer flashes his badge:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         We're police officers. We're looking 
                         for a fugitive, John Book. He's living 
                         here?

                                     ELI
                         I have nothing to say to you. Get 
                         out of my house!

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You speak English. Good. Now listen 
                         

                                     RACHEL
                              (recovering)
                         No, you listen. Get out!

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Lady, I'm here to help you. This man 
                         is very dangerous. An armed criminal.
                              (ingratiating)
                         He's got a gun, hasn't he?

                                     RACHEL
                         You have no right here!

               McElroy re-enters.

                                     MCELROY
                         He's not in this building.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (to Eli)
                         All right, where is he?

               Suddenly Eli SHOUTS: It's deafening. Probably the loudest 
               noise Eli has ever made:

                                     ELI
                         John Book!

               McElroy whips around, smashes Eli on the temple with the 
               butt of his shotgun. Eli crumples to the floor. Rachel 
               SCREAMS, runs to Eli.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               Book and Samuel in the milkhouse. They've heard Eli's outcry. 
               Book moves to the window, looks out.

               BOOK'S POV  FERGIE

               About halfway between the barn and the house. He turns from 
               glancing back toward the house (having heard Eli's shout) 
               and starts again toward the barn. Gun at the ready.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               As Book REACTS.

               INT. KITCHEN  DAY

               Rachel kneeling next to Eli, wiping at his bruise with a 
               damp cloth. Schaeffer looks on.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         He'll live.

                                     RACHEL
                         You might have killed him!

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (to McElroy)
                         Find Fergie, check the barns. I'll 
                         watch these two.

               McElroy nods, moves outside, turns toward the barns.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               Book still at the window, Samuel now beside him, trying to 
               get a look.

                                     SAMUEL
                         Is it them?

                                     BOOK
                              (turning, mind racing)
                         It's them, Sam.
                              (he bends to the boy, 
                              takes him by the 
                              shoulders)
                         Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to 
                         me carefully. Listen to me as you 
                         never listened before.

                                     SAMUEL
                              (interrupting)
                         Are they going to kill you?

                                     BOOK
                         Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go 
                         across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. 
                         Run as fast as you can. And stay 
                         there!

                                     SAMUEL
                         What are you going to do?

                                     BOOK
                         I'll be all right. You just do as I 
                         say.

               He takes Samuel by the hand, leads him to the side door. He 
               bends, holds the boy close.

                                     SAMUEL
                         Don't let them hurt you.

                                     BOOK
                              (rising, pushing Samuel 
                              toward door)
                         I won't. Now run.
                              (as Sam looks back)
                         Fast as you can!

               Sam turns, takes off.

               EXT. REAR DOOR  DAY

               Samuel running.

               EXT. BARN  DAY

               Fergie almost to the upper barn, McElroy  well back and 
               moving slowly, circumspectly  headed toward the lower barn.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               Book, at another window in the lower barn, sees McElroy 
               heading for the milkhouse door. He can't see Fergie. He turns, 
               crosses the cowpen area, climbs an inner ladder leading to 
               the upper barn.

               EXT. BARN  DAY

               Fergie at the door to the upper barn, moving very cautiously, 
               gun up. He eases around the doorpost, looks within.

               INT. BARN  ANGLE PAST BOOK

               Beyond Book, now at the top of the ladder, we see Fergie 
               easing into the barn. Book pulls himself up, crawls behind 
               the wall of the mule stalls, opens gate, eases in beside 
               Luke, urgently whispering and patting the animal to calm 
               him. He gets to the animal's head, crouches, strokes Luke's 
               nose. The mule's huge flanks quiver, his nostril's and eyes 
               widen, but he makes no untoward sound. Book closes the gate.

               BACK TO FERGIE

               He comes on warily, muzzle first, eyes darting.

               DOLLYING WITH him as he reaches the first mule's stall, opens 
               the gate. An edgy mule turns, eyes him, shuffles nervously. 
               Fergie backs off, moves on.

               BOOK

               As he listens, tenses, hearing Fergie's feet in the fresh 
               straw.

               Book eases back alongside Luke, waits.

               BACK TO FERGIE

               As he approaches Luke's stall, reaches for the gate-latch.

               BOOK  FLASH CUT

               As the gate swings open, Book shouts and gives Luke a whack 
               on the back. The mule's pent-up nerves and feral energy 
               explode in an horrendous SCREAM.

               FERGIE

               Bowled backwards by the rearing animal as the gate flies 
               open, involuntarily FIRING, suddenly finding himself under 
               the lethal hooves of a twelve-hundred pound beast. Staggering 
               backwards, he SCREAMS, FIRES again, the load striking the 
               mule in its heaving chest as a flailing hoof smashes into 
               Fergie's head and the other hoof snaps his shotgun in half 
               like a matchstick.

               BOOK

               As he slips out of the stall, ducks toward the rear of the 
               barn.

               FERGIE

               Fallen, skull smashed... and now the dying Luke's legs buckle 
               and he collapses atop Fergie.

               EXT. BARN  DAY

               McElroy standing still, shock-eyed, looking toward the sound 
               of the shots. Then starting slowly forward.

               SCHAEFFER

               On the porch of the house, looking toward the barn.

               EXT. FIELD  DAY

               Some distance from the barn, Samuel's hearing the shots, 
               stops dead in his tracks... the sound of the shots still 
               REVERBERATING across the quiet fields.

                                     SAMUEL
                              (stricken)
                         Mr. Book?

               He hesitates, then turns, starts trotting back toward the 
               barns.

               EXT. / INT. KITCHEN PORCH  DAY

               Rachel has moved into the open kitchen door, glances anxiously 
               toward the barns. Starts out. Schaeffer pushes her back.

               As McElroy, checking the safety on his twelve-gauge, steps 
               into the barn.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               McElroy flattens himself against the wall, looks around 
               fearfully.

                                     MCELROY
                              (softly)
                         Fergie?

               Only silence.

               EXT. FRONT PORCH  DAY

               Schaeffer staring toward the barn, SHOUTS:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         What the hell happened?

               He listens, hears nothing, snorts, starts toward the barn 
               checking his gun, not hurrying.

               INT. KITCHEN  DAY

               Eli now seated at the table, holding a cloth to his head.

               EXT. FIELD  DAY

               Samuel running as fast as he can trips as he crosses a small 
               muddy stream, falls full length, scrambles up, runs on.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               McElroy, moving very cautiously, comes around the mule stalls, 
               stops short, stares off screen.

               HIS POV  FERGIE

               Where he lies half buried beneath the huge bulk of the mule, 
               his head crushed like an eggshell.

               BACK TO MCELROY

               As he moves on around Fergie and the dead mule, planting 
               each foot as if he were walking in a mine field.

               BOOK

               Standing in shadow at the back of the barn next to a hay 
               mow.

               HIS POV  MCELROY

               Moving toward the center of the barn.

               BOOK

               As he starts to move even further back, he nudges into a 
               rope fastened to the wall behind him, He looks at it, looks 
               up.

               HIS POV  THE ROPE

               It runs from where it is fastened to the wall straight up to 
               the center roofbeam of the barn to a trolley fixed to a track 
               that runs the length of the roofbeam. Attached to this trolley 
               is a big hayfork (Paul Krantz has one), U-shaped, sharply-
               pointed at each end of the U. the points hanging toward the 
               floor. The thing weighs about eighty pounds, and is suspended 
               in place by the rope anchored at the wall next to Book.

               BACK TO BOOK

               Keeping one eye on McElroy, he carefully begins to un-tie 
               the trip rope.

               MCELROY

               Moving out toward the center of the barn, almost under the 
               suspended hay fork. He stops short, listens. Then, either 
               spotting a moving shadow or hearing a SOUND, he FIRES. His 
               shot rattles off the side of a manure spreader. He SHOUTS:

                                     MCELROY
                         Book, you sneaky bastard, I know 
                         you're here! Come out and fight!

               EXT. BARNYARD  DAY

               Samuel, at the top of the barnyard, stops at the SOUND OF 
               THE SHOT, wide-eyed. He listens for an-instant, starts a 
               step toward the barn, then stops again, looks to a large 
               bell suspended in a cupola by one of the outbuildings. He 
               moves quickly to the bell, seizes the rope, pulls. The bell 
               CLANGS loudly, Sonorously.

               SCHAEFFER

               On the front porch, looking around for the location of the 
               sounding bell. He takes a step toward the barn, the stops, 
               looks back toward the house... frustrated.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               Book watches as McElroy starts to move again looking back 
               toward the SOUNDING of the bell.

               HIGH ANGLE  HAY FORK

               Looking down we can see McElroy almost directly beneath the 
               hay fork. The bell SOUNDING throughout. BOOK Waiting... trip 
               rope in hand. Then:

                                     BOOK
                              (shouting)
                         Hey, Mac!

               And he lets go the trip rope.

               MCELROY

               As he turns toward the SOUND of Book's voice.

               HAY FORK

               As it plummets down, causing a RATCHETING SOUND that fills 
               the barn, even drowns out the SOUND of the bell.

               MCELROY

               Eyes darting wildly, looking up.

               HIS POV  HAY FORK

               Plunging straight for him.

               MCELROY

               Diving to one side.

               ANGLE  HAY FORK

               THUDDING into the barn floor like a great trident fork.

               Quivering there, not a foot from McElroy's head.

               MCELROY

               Staring at the fork pop-eyed.

               BOOK

               Sprinting toward a ladder thrust up through an opening in 
               the barn floor just in front of his parked car.

               MCELROY

               Spotting Book, coming up to one knee, quick-aiming, FIRING. 
               The shot smashes the windshield of the car.

               BOOK

               Diving, rolling, slamming into the top of the ladder, flailing 
               down out of sight.

               MCELROY

               FIRING AGAIN, then again. Emptying the gun, cursing as he 
               begins to reload, gets to his feet, starts toward the ladder. 
               The BELL still SOUNDING outside. The hood of the car SLOWLY 
               POPS UP.

               ANGLE

               As McElroy wheels at the movement of the car's hood, FIRES 
               twice.

               MCELROY'S POV  LAPP BUGGY

               The buckshot virtually blows the dashboard off.

               EXT. BARNYARD  DAY

               Samuel RINGING the bell. The bell rope is short, and so is 
               Samuel and his feet go off the ground with every swing of 
               the rockerarm.

               He hangs on grimly, his black hat clinging to the back of 
               his head, his face set against the tears that move down his 
               cheeks.

               SCHAEFFER

               Comes hesitantly down the path toward the barn, looking toward 
               the sound of the bell, but also looking back in glances toward 
               the house to make sure Rachel and Eli stay where they are. 
               He still can't see Samuel.

               HIS POV  THE PORCH

               As Rachel starts off the porch, takes a few steps.

               SCHAEFFER

               Turning, SHOUTING:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You stay put!

               RACHEL

               She stops. She is also unable to see Samuel.

               SCHAEFFER

               Moving out toward the barn, rounding a corner... and there 
               is Samuel at the bellrope. He starts toward him.

               EXT. FIELDS  DAY

               Beyond Samuel, well out in the fields of the Stoltzfus farm, 
               Stotlzfus and others  including Hochstetler and his brothers 
                are baling the first cutting of June hay.

               But the operation has come to a halt. All are looking in 
               toward the Lapp farm, hearing the RINGING OF THE BELL (the 
               Amish cry for help), wondering, hesitating.

               But now, as we watch, led by Hochstetler, they start in toward 
               Samuel.

               EXT. BARNYARD  DAY

               As Schaeffer reaches Samuel, SHOUTS:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Cut that out!

               Samuel looks at him, keeps on pulling.

               Schaeffer quickly crosses to him, grabs him by the back of 
               the neck, tries to pull him off the bell rope. Samuel hangs 
               on grimly.

               Schaeffer yanks hard, succeeds in yanking Samuel free, shoves 
               him roughly aside. Then Schaeffer turns, FIRES a shotgun 
               blast into the top of the bellrope. It still hangs by several 
               threads, so he FIRES again.

               The rope drops to the ground. Schaeffer reloads, turns to 
               look at Samuel, just getting to his feet. A moment... when 
               Schaeffer, recognizing Samuel as the Amish kid who saw McElroy 
               kill Zenovich, perhaps thinks of disposing of the witness 
               right then and there.

               But a glance toward the oncoming Amish gives him pause. He 
               SNARLS at Sam:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Get down to the house and stay there!

               Samuel gets to his feet, turns, trots off.

               RACHEL

               Already halfway out to the barn, running to gather Sam in 
               her arms... then to lead him back toward the house.

               SCHAEFFER

               Turning, starting very slowly toward the barn.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               McElroy at the top of the ladder, looking down. Then easing 
               over, placing his feet on the rungs.

               BOOK

               He stands below in a cowpen, using the cows for cover. The 
               cows stare balefully at him. A large goat nuzzles him, hooks 
               at him with its horns. Book waits, watches.

               HIS POV  MCELROY

               Visible to his knees as he eases down the ladder. He stops 
               at every rung to scrape his shoes free of the cowshit covering 
               the rungs.

               BACK TO BOOK

               He turns now to a door at the back of the pen. He un-hooks 
               it, pulls it open, moves inside.

               ANOTHER ANGLE  BOOK

               He is now in a small passageway giving on to the entrance to 
               a nearly-empty silo. Above the entrance, a ladder (interior) 
               rises to the top of the structure.

               Book looks in, and up. We should get the impression that 
               Book's been here before, expects what he sees.

               WHAT HE SEES

               Forty feet up, a patch of blue sky through an open hatch.

               BACK TO BOOK

               He steps through to the base of the ladder, then ducks beyond 
               it into the silo. There is about two feet of old silage 
               covering the floor. He turns, looks up the white walls.

               HIS POV  INSIDE SILO

               An inside ladder runs to the top.

               HIS POV  KICKBOARD

               Standing against the wall next to the entrance... . obviously 
               to be inserted as the silo is filled.

               BOOK

               Now, quickly, he ducks back out through the entrance, crosses 
               to the door to the cowpen, very cautiously peers out..

               WHAT HE SEES

               McElroy at the bottom of the ladder, looking in the other 
               direction (toward the milkhouse).

               BACK TO BOOK

               Very carefully he shoves the cowpen door (which opens outward 
               into the cowpen). It begins to swing very slowly open. Book 
               immediately turns, darts back into the silo.

               MCELROY

               Turning slowly toward the cowpen... then FIRES twice as his 
               eye catches the motion of the swinging door. His shots blow 
               half a row of Eli's precious tools off an adjacent wall. 
               McElroy reloads, starts across toward the door.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Old Eli, at the sight of Samuel, rises from the table.

                                     ELI
                         Praise Gott!

               Rachel stands aside as the old man embraces Samuel long and 
               hard.

               She watches as he turns to the cupboard, takes down the big 
               family Bible. He crosses to the table, sets the book down, 
               places his hand on its pulls Samuel to the table beside him.

               Rachel holds another beat as she stares at the old man 
               helplessly, then she rushes to where she hid Book's gun, 
               takes it down... her trembling hands take the bullets out of 
               the coffee jar. She drops several as she tries to figure out 
               how to open the chamber to load it.

               In the b.g., Eli glances up, sees what she is about... he 
               rises and crosses to her. Samuel watches from the table.

                                     ELI
                              (fiercely)
                         No, Rachel...

                                     RACHEL
                         I have to help him!

               Rachel somehow manages to open the chamber and begins to try 
               to load the bullets. Eli's callused hand closes over hers, 
               halting the action:

                                     ELI
                         It is not our way!

               Bullets are already CLATTERING to the floor from her trembling 
               fingers as she raises her eyes to Eli's.

               A long beat as Rachel looks at him... Finally her fingers 
               release the pistol and it CLATTERS to the floor. She closes 
               her eyes.

               Samuel, who has gotten up, moved to a window, watches Eli 
               and Rachel silently.

               Eli leads her to the table, places her hands on the Bible 
               beneath his. They stand there and they pray.

               INT. SILO  DAY

               Book finishes putting the kickboard into the entrance.

               MCELROY

               Moving among the cows, stepping cautiously between the 
               cowflops.

               The goat nudges him once, then butts him rather firmly. 
               McElroy swats at him with the gun butt, moves to the door. 
               As he arrives, he HEARS a noise  very slight  from the 
               direction of the silo.

               He enters the passage way, looks in toward the silo entrance, 
               He hesitates. Another slight noise. He steps in to the base 
               of the inner ladder, looks up.

               HIS POV  THE HATCH

               The patch of blue sky, forty feet up.

               Schaeffer, easing toward the mule stalls, MUTTERS, CURSES 
               under his breath. Then he rounds the corner of the first 
               stall... and there is Fergie with Luke the mule on top of 
               him. Schaeffer stares, blinks... moves on spotting a spent 
               shotgun shell near the hayfork...

               INT. SILO  DAY

               Book listening at the kickboard. SOUNDS of feet, shotgun 
               rattling against metal rungs, Book moves to the ladder on 
               his side, starts silently up.

               MCELROY

               Climbing with difficulty, shotgun clutched in one hand.

               BOOK

               He climbs up to the second kickboard, pauses, checks the 
               distance to the floor, starts upward again.

               The Amish beginning to arrive. Sam comes running, pulls 
               Stoltzfus toward the door of the milkhouse as the other Amish 
               look at the shot-shattered bellrope. Rachel and Eli come 
               rapidly up the path toward the group.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               Schaeffer finds another spent shotgun shell, crosses to the 
               ladder, looks down. He sets his shotgun down, takes out his 
               service revolver, starts down.

               INT. SILO  DAY

               Book has reaches the third kickboard, about thirty feet from 
               the ground. He checks it, turns the thumb-screws that hold 
               it in place, places his hand on the handle, moves to one 
               side as best he can... hangs there, listening.

               MCELROY

               Rattling up the other ladder, approaching the third kickboard.

               BOOK

               Listening tensely, hearing McElroy arrive on the other side 
               of the kickboard. Then, deliberately, Book makes a fist, 
               raps on the board smartly once.

               MCELROY

               Startled, REACTING. He sets his feet, leans back against the 
               back wall of the ladder well, brings the shotgun up, puts 
               the muzzle against the kickboard, clicks off the safety.

               BOOK

               We HEAR with him the thump of the muzzle, the CLICK... and, 
               with marvelous speed, Book pulls the kickboard and drops it 
               to the floor.

               McELROY  FLASH CUT Staring in, stun-eyed, already falling 
               forward (having leaned his weight on the shotgun) as Book 
               seizes the shotgun by the barrel, pulls inward.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As McElroy pitches forward through the opening, SCREAMS and 
               GRABS as he plunges past Book. The shotgun FIRES as McElroy 
               manages to hold onto Book, and both men plunge thirty feet 
               to the bottom of the silo.

               BOOK

               He falls almost straight down, lands on his back, lies 
               stunned.

               MCELROY

               His forward motion has carried him across the silo. His head 
               bounds off the white brick wall about five feet up... and he 
               falls in a heap, blood gushing from his head, as...

               TIGHT ON BOOK

               Blinking, groaning, just beginning to stir... and, suddenly, 
               into the frame comes a hand with a pistol in it. The muzzle 
               is placed firmly against Book's temple.

               WIDER

               Schaeffer holding the pistol. He cocks the pistol, tenses as 
               if to FIRE (and he is actually about to)... when there is a 
               SOUND behind him. He snaps around.

               WHAT HE SEES

               Old Stoltzfus and Samuel standing in the kickboard opening 
               (Schaeffer having kicked the kickboard in when he heard the 
               shot from within the silo). They stand solemnly, looking on 
               as:

               SCHAEFFER

               He eases the hammer down on this pistol, speaks softly:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Okay, Johnny. On your feet.

               THE SCENE

               As Book struggles to his feet  Schaeffer holding the pistol 
               tight to Book's head. Book turns, sees Samuel and Stoltzfus, 
               blinks.

               Schaeffer shoves Book toward the opening. As Book moves toward 
               Samuel, he speaks quietly:

                                     BOOK
                         It's okay, Sam.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As Book and McElroy move out of the silo, down the passageway 
               toward the milkhouse, Stoltzfus and Sam (after a glance in 
               at the inert McElroy) follow and...

               EXT. BARN  DAY

               As first Stoltzfus and Samuel, then Book and Schaeffer emerge 
               into the barnyard. Schaeffer has the muzzle of his pistol 
               pressed firmly against Book's throat, just below his jaw.

               Schaeffer pulls up, frowning:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Hold it.

               WHAT HE SEES

               The Amishmen gathered  the Stoltzfus family, the Hochstetler 
               brothers, et al. All staring hard at Schaeffer and Book.

               EXT. BARN / DRIVE  DAY

               From a high wide angle the final scene is played out. 
               Schaeffer and Book, now moving again slowly up the drive, 
               the Amish following along closely on both sides.

               CLOSE ON BOOK

               As Schaeffer prods Book forward, warily eyeing the Amish.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Get back, you people!
                              (prodding)
                         Keep moving, Johnny...

               Book takes a couple of steps further, then abruptly stops. 
               The Amish stand about close, staring, no one moving. Book 
               now slowly turns his head, looks at Schaeffer.

                                     BOOK
                         You're going to have to do it right 
                         here, Schaeffer.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Don't try me, Johnny!

               Eli steps forward, bloody cloth held to his head.

                                     ELI
                         So... will you kill us all, then?

               ANGLE

               As Schaeffer's eyes waver between Book and Eli, Book slowly 
               turns until he is facing Schaeffer... the gun now leveled  
               and almost pressing against  Book's chest. Book locks eyes 
               with Schaeffer.

               Quietly:

                                     BOOK
                         It's all over, Paul.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Move! Or you die right here!

               Book's right hand snakes out, grabs Schaeffer by the gunhand 
               wrist, twists viciously, Schaeffer SCREAMS in pain, the gun 
               falls out of his hand, he starts to his knees under the force 
               of Book's grip.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As Book bends, picks up the pistol, releases Schaeffer, pushes 
               him away. Schaeffer staggers against Hochstetler, who  partly 
               to keep him from falling, and partly (it appears) to 
               congratulate him on his surrender  wraps one brawny arm 
               around Schaeffer's shoulders, gives him a short approving 
               nod... holds Schaeffer as:

               BOOK

               Turning, looking into the crowd, finding Rachel. Their gazes 
               meet, hold for a long MOMENT. In the eyes of both we read 
               resignation... whatever there was between them has been 
               terribly damaged. It is almost certainly over for them, too.

               EXT. BARN  DAY

               HIGH SHOT holding the moment.

               EXT. LAPP FARM  LATE AFTERNOON

               The door opens and Book steps out, looking somehow strange 
               in his working suit. He looks about him, sees Samuel down by 
               the pond.

               EXT. POND

               He eases down beside Samuel. They both stare into the pond.

                                     SAMUEL
                         Are you really ever coming back?

                                     BOOK
                         Got to, Sam. You and I are going to 
                         a courthouse together, put some people 
                         behind bars.

                                     SAMUEL
                         Have you got your gun on now?

                                     BOOK
                         Sure have, Sam.

               Sam grins. Book takes him in his arms, holds him.

               EXT. HOUSE  DAY

               Book opens the door of the car, turns to find Rachel standing 
               there with his Amish hat in hand.

                                     RACHEL
                         I want you to take this... to remember 
                         by.

                                     BOOK
                         Where's my baggy pants?

                                     RACHEL
                         Here. Whenever you want them.

               He wants to kiss her, but does not. Their eyes say it all. 
               Eli has a final word, SHOUTING from the porch.

                                     ELI
                         You be careful, John Book! Out among 
                         them English!

               Book gets quickly into the car.

               INT. /EXT. DRIVEWAY  LAPP FARM  DAY

               As Book drives, he sees an open buggy coming down the hill 
               toward the farm, He slows as he passes, It's Daniel 
               Hochstetler. A long beat, and as they pass, Hochstetler gives 
               Book an expansive tip of his hat.

               INT. BOOK'S CAR

               Book turns to look back at his rival, a doubt in his eyes.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                  My wife, Naomi, the Duchess of Bay
                  Ridge, Brooklyn, a former model
                  and Miller Lite girl.

       Naomi licks her lips; she's incredibly, painfully hot.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                  Yeah, she was the one blowing me
                  in the Ferrari, so put your dick
                  back in your pants.

       Over the following, WE SEE a quick


7-7C   SERIES OF SHOTS                                                   7-7C

       All taken from TV; a mansion from Lifestyles of the Rich
       and Famous; wealthy PEOPLE applauding at a polo match;
       a yacht sailing crystal blue seas; Robert Wagner and
       Stephanie Powers toasting with champagne on Hart to Hart.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                  In addition to Naomi and my two
                  perfect kids, I own a mansion,
                  private jet, six cars, three
                  horses, two vacation homes and
                  a 170 foot yacht.


8      INT. HOTEL BEDROOM - NIGHT (FEB `95)                                8

       Sweaty, wild-eyed and naked, Jordan fucks an HISPANIC
       HOOKER from behind.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                  I also gamble like a degenerate,
                  drink like a fish, fuck hookers
                  maybe five times a week and have
                  three different Federal agencies
                  looking to indict me.

       He dismounts, snorts some coke through a straw, then uses
       it to blow some into her asshole.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                  Oh yeah, and I love drugs.
                                                                  4.
       The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages      3/5/13

     Jordan looks up suddenly, paranoid, as if he's hearing
     voices.


9    INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT     (FEB `95)                             9

     Jordan, drooling and stoned out of his skull, wears a
     rumpled custom-made business suit as he mans a set of
     controls next to his frantic co-pilot, CAPTAIN DAVE.

                               CAPTAIN DAVE
                Pull up!   Jesus! We're gonna
                crash!!

     Jordan's head bobs as he pulls back on the stick.
     The helicopter rises sharply, then levels out, hovering
     30 feet above a huge mansion. Down below, through
     Jordan's hazy, DOUBLE VISIONED POV, we see a sparkling
     pool, tennis court and waterfall.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                Check this out -- despite my
                completely fucked-up state, I
                could fly straight while still
                seeing two of everything.

     He closes one eye; his POV sharpens. Putting pressure on
     the stick, the helicopter descends slowly over the
     driving range... then LURCHES and SLAMS to the ground.

                              JORDAN
                     (to Captain Dave)
                Ya guzza git hazarous doozy pay,
                buddy.


10   INT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - FRONT DOOR - DAY      (FEB `95)            10

     Morning. Sober now, impeccable in suit and tie, Jordan
     heads for the door holding a glass of orange juice.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                Yes, on a daily basis I take
                enough drugs to sedate greater
                Long Island.


11   EXT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - CONTINUOUS       (FEB `95)                 11

     He pops two white pills, swigs some juice, then speaks
     directly to the camera as he heads for a waiting limo.

                              JORDAN
                I take Quaaludes for my back,
                fifteen to twenty a day.
                                                               5.
       The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13
                              JORDAN (CONT'D)
                I use Xanax to stay focused,
                ambien to sleep, pot to mellow
                out, cocaine to wake up and
                morphine because it's awesome.


12   EXT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - LONG ISLAND - DAY     (FEB `95)    12

     The limo pulls up to the black glass office building.
     Jordan gets out, heads inside through a back door.

                              JORDAN
                But of all the drugs under God's
                blue heaven, there's one that's my
                absolute favorite.


13   INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - JORDAN'S OFFICE - DAY (FEB `95)    13

     Gadgets, computers, oxblood leather furniture. With
     the DIN of the brokerage firm bleeding in, Jordan uses
     a credit card to cut a line of coke on his desk. As he
     peels a crisp $100 DOLLAR BILL off a wad, rolls it up:

                              JORDAN
                Enough of this shit'll make you
                invincible, able to conquer the
                world and eviscerate your enemies.

     He SNARFS up the line, gestures to the cocaine.

                              JORDAN (CONT'D)
                I'm not talking about this. I'm
                talking about this.
                     (Jordan unfurls the
                      $100 with a SNAP)
                Money is the oxygen of capitalism
                and I wanna breathe more than any
                other human being alive.

     He crumbles it into a ball and tosses it into a corner,
     where it comes to rest with two dozen others. Over his
     back as we TRACK HIM out of his office toward what sounds
     like the ROAR of a mob--

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                Money doesn't just buy you a
                better life -- better food, better
                cars, better pussy -- it also
                makes you a better person. You
                can give generously to the church
                of your choice or the political
                party. You can save the fucking
                spotted owl with money.
                                                                    6.

14    INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - DAY         (FEB `95)        14

      Arms akimbo, Jordan stands above the bullpen, a huge open
      space with tightly packed rows of maple colored desks.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 But most of all, in any country in
                 the world, money can buy you love.
                 Fuck the Beatles.

      His 300 BROKERS, mostly young men with their jackets off,
      scream wildly. They worship him.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 With that in mind, at the tender
                 age of 22, after marrying my
                 girlfriend Teresa--


14A   SCENES 14A - 18 OMITTED                                            14A


19    EXT. WALL STREET - DAY      (MAY `87)                              19

      An express bus pull up -- its sign reads "Wall
      Street"....

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 --I headed to the only place that
                 befit my high-minded ambitions...

      Jordan emerges, kisses TERESA goodbye, then joins a sea
      of Commuters heading to work.

                               JERRY FOGEL (PRE-LAP)
                 You are lower than fucking pond
                 scum.


20    INT. L.F. ROTHSCHILD - BULLPEN - DAY       (MAY `87)               20

      Computers, telephones everywhere. At their desks, 45
      shirt-sleeved BROKERS read their Wall St. Journals,
      readying for war. Like an eager puppy, Jordan follows
      broker JERRY FOGEL, 30, thick-lipped and bow-tied...

                               JERRY FOGEL
                 You got a problem with that?
                      (reads name tag)
                 Jordan?

                                JORDAN
                 Nope.   No problem at all.
                                                           7.
  The Wolf of Wall Street    Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

                         JERRY FOGEL
           Your job is `connector', which
           means you'll be dialing the phone
           over 500 times a day, trying to
           `connect' me with business owners.
           And till you pass your Series 7,
           that's all you'll be doing. Sit.

Jordan takes a seat at the desk next to Fogel's.

                         JERRY FOGEL (CONT'D)
           Just so you know, last year I made
           over 300k and the other guy you'll
           be working for made a million.

                         JORDAN (V.O.)
           A million dollars? I could only
           imagine what a douchebag that guy
           must be.

A manicured hand lands on Jordan's shoulder. It's MARK
HANNA, 30s, charismatic, movie-star handsome.

                          MARK HANNA
           Jordan? Mark Hanna.
                (re: Fogel)
           Good, you've met Jerry. One of
           the smartest guys in the office.
           Who's ever sucked a dog's cock out
           of loneliness.

Fogel's smile turns to a frown.      He hands Jordan a stack
of 3x5 index cards.

                         JERRY FOGEL
           Smile and dial. And don't pick
           your fucking head up till one.

                         MARK HANNA
           Don't mind Jerry, his father raped
           him as a child. Besides, I'm
           senior broker here, he's a
           worthless piker. I heard you
           pitched stock at your job
           interview.

                         JORDAN
           Had to do something to stand out.

                         MARK HANNA
           I fuckin' love that! Let's grab
           lunch later. Windows good with
           you?

                            JORDAN
           Great.   Yeah.

Hanna gives him a wink, looks at the clock on the giant
electronic stock ticker encircling the room -- 9:30 a.m.

                            MARK HANNA
           Let's fuck!!

RING!!! Absolute pandemonium at the BELL signalling the
opening of the stock market. Feet fly off desks; Brokers
and their Connectors dial phones like mad. The CAMERA
PUSHES IN on JORDAN, mesmerized as he takes in the ROAR.

                         BROKER #1
                (to Broker #2)
           Miniscribe's a fuckin' steal!
           Thirty eight bucks a share!

                          MARK HANNA
                 (into headset)
           Your broker in West Virginia?
           What are you buying, a coal mine?
           It's the 80s, the game is high-
           tech.

                         BROKER #2
                (to Broker #3)
           Fuckface! I got 50,000 July 50s!

                         JORDAN (V.O.)
           You want to know what money sounds
           like? Visit a trading floor on
           Wall Street. Fuck this, shit
           that. Cock, cunt, asshole. I
           couldn't believe how these guys
           talked to each other--

Fogel notices Jordan sitting there frozen.        He covers his
mouthpiece, kicks the desk violently.

                         JERRY FOGEL
           Dial the cocksucking phone!

Jordan snaps out of it, starts dialing.

                         JORDAN (V.O.)
           I was hooked within seconds.

Mark Hanna slams down his phone in victory, scrawls out a
"buy" ticket. He places the ticket into a glass cylinder
which he slips into a plastic pneumatic tube.

                         JORDAN (V.O.)
           It was like mainlining adrenaline.

The tube is WHOOSHED into the ceiling and we're suddenly--
                                                               9.

21   INT. WINDOWS ON THE WORLD - DAY     (MAY `87)                  21

     CLOSE ON a COKE SPOON whose contents disappear up a
     nostril. PULL BACK TO REVEAL...

     The lunchtime power spot with panoramic views of the
     city. At a corner table, a paranoid Jordan looks around
     as Hanna does another bump of coke. None of the other
     DINERS seem to notice or care.

                              MARK HANNA
                     (offering the spoon)
                Got enough for one more? Tootski?

                               JORDAN
                No.   Thanks though.

     Hanna slips the vial into his pocket as HECTOR, the
     tuxedoed Maitre'D, approaches.

                              HECTOR
                Mr. Hanna, what can I bring for
                you on this glorious afternoon?

     Hanna surreptitiously palms Hector a $100; Jordan
     notices.

                              MARK HANNA
                Here's the game plan, Hector.
                Bring us two Absolut Martinis
                straight up. Precisely seven and
                a half minutes after you deliver
                those you'll bring two more, then
                two more every five minutes until
                one of us passes out.

                              HECTOR
                An excellent strategy, sir.

                              JORDAN
                Actually, I'm good with 7-Up.

     Jordan might as well have farted at the table.

                               MARK HANNA
                First day on Wall Street, Hector.
                Give him time.
                     (Hector offers menus)
                No thanks, I'm not eating.

     Hector heads off.

                              JORDAN
                You can get high during the day
                and still function?
                                                         10.
 The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

                         MARK HANNA
           High is the only way to do this
           fucking job. Guy who coined the
           term "three-martini lunch" was a
           woman. Cocaine and hookers, my
           friend, the keys to success.

Jordan smiles, not sure if Hanna is kidding.

                          JORDAN
           I gotta say, I'm really excited
           about being part of your team.
           I wanna do all I can for our
           clients and --

                         MARK HANNA
                (reciting an ad)
           "Here at L.F. Rothschild, our
           clients aren't just important,
           they're family." Just as long as
           we get our taste first. Remember
           something, Jordan, your top
           priority in this job: make us
           money. If the clients get rich
           along the way, bully for them.
           Got a girlfriend?

                          JORDAN
           Wife.   She cuts hair.

Mark swallows a comment about that.      Gets to business.

                         MARK HANNA
           OK, first rule of Wall Street.
           Nobody -- and I don't care if
           you're Warren Buffet or Jimmy
           Buffet -- nobody knows if a
           stock's going up, down or fucking
           sideways, least of all stock
           brokers. But we have to pretend
           we know. Make sure you stay
           relaxed. Nobody wants to buy
           something from someone who sounds
           like they haven't gotten laid in a
           month. Take breaks when you feel
           stressed, jerk off if you can.
           You like jerking off, right?

                           JORDAN
           Well... sure.

                         MARK HANNA
           Good, jerking off is key. And I
           highly recommend cocaine, which
           will make you dial faster, which
           is good for me. Churn `em and
           burn `em, baby.

     A BUSBOY stops by with a fresh napkin for Mark who thanks
     him. Then, discreetly as possible, Mark removes a fresh
     vial of cocaine tucked within and takes a quick snort.
     Jordan realizes: that's why he palmed the maitre d' $100.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                For the next six months I learned
                the ways of Wall Street.


22   INT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT    (OCT `87)                           22

     As STRIPPERS grind in b.g, Jordan parties with Mark Hanna
     and dozens of BROKERS and TRAINEES. Jordan sips a
     martini and studies Mark Hanna, hitting on a STRIPPER.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                That fall I passed my Series 7.
                Finally it was here.

     Briefcase in hand, Jordan boards the elevator with a
     dozen other BROKERS.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                My first day as a stockbroker, a
                future Master of the Universe.

     And as the doors close, on screen WE SEE:

                        OCTOBER 19th, 1987


24   INT. L.F. ROTHSCHILD - BULLPEN - DAY      (OCT `87)            24

     Total chaos. Jordan dials the phone as all around him
     Brokers panic, screaming into headsets.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                They called it Black Monday.
                By four p.m. the market was down
                508 points, the biggest one-day
                drop since the crash of `29.

     4 p.m. The closing bell RINGS; the entire place goes
     silent. Brokers look at each other, stunned.

                               MARK HANNA
                Holy.   Fucking. Shit.

     And as the Brokers start commiserating with each other...

                L.F. Rothschild, a company that
                had been in business since 1883,
                closed its doors within a month.


25   INT. JORDAN & TERESA'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY (DEC `87)       25

     Jordan sits at the table perusing the Times classifieds.
     Teresa approaches with two coffees. Sits next to him.

                              TERESA
                So I'll take an extra shift, don't
                worry about it.

                              JORDAN
                You work too much as it is.

                              TERESA
                We could pawn my engagement ring.

                              JORDAN
                We're not pawning anything. I'm
                gonna be a millionaire, Teresa.

                              TERESA
                You know that doesn't matter,
                right?

     He smiles, kisses her.     Together, they peruse the ads.

                              JORDAN
                     (points to an ad)
                "Nobody Beats the Wiz".      I could
                be a stock boy.

                              TERESA
                You're a stock broker.

                              JORDAN
                No one's hiring brokers right now,
                sweetie.

     They go back to the ads.     After a few beats, she points--

                                 TERESA
                This place is.

     around confused, heads toward an unmarked storefront.

27   INT. INVESTOR'S CENTER - DAY     (DEC `87)                     27

     The antithesis of L.F. Rothschild, with cheap furniture
     and a dozen misfit "BROKERS" giving loud, obnoxious sales
     pitches. Jordan enters, a modern man among cave people.
     DWAYNE, slovenly, 35, with a walrus mustache, looks up.

                              JORDAN
                I'm looking for Investor's Center?

                              DWAYNE
                That's us, hey. Dwayne.

                              JORDAN
                     (as they shake hands)
                Jordan Belfort, I called earlier.
                I was a broker with Rothschild.

     Dwayne motions Jordan to a seat. Nearby, a Broker in
     ratty Keds, TOBY WELCH, is screaming into his phone.

                              TOBY WELCH
                I'm tellin' you, this stock is
                goin' up!... Cause I know,
                okay?!... I have inside
                information!

     Jordan looks at him, appalled at what he's hearing.

                              JORDAN
                Where are your quotrons?

                              DWAYNE
                No quotrons, we sell off the pink
                sheets -- penny stocks.

     Dwayne slides Jordan a large thin book; its pages are
     literally pink. He explains as Jordan flips the pages:

                              DWAYNE (CONT'D)
                Company don't have enough capital
                to be listed on NASDAQ, their
                shares trade here.
                     (points to the book)
                Like these guys, Aerotyne? They
                make radar detectors out of a
                garage in Dubuque.

                              JORDAN
                Six cents a share? Who buys this
                crap?

                              DWAYNE
                Schmucks mostly. Mailmen,
                plumbers, people thinking they can
                get rich quick. They answer our
                ads, Popular Mechanics, Hustler.
                                                                 14.
      The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages    3/5/13

                              JORDAN
                The spread on these is huge.

                              DWAYNE
                So's your commission, that's the
                point. Blue chips stocks you get
                what, one percent? Pink sheets
                are fifty.

                              JORDAN
                Wait a second. You're telling me
                if I sell two thousand dollars
                worth of stock, my commission is a
                thousand bucks?

                              DWAYNE
                Technically, yeah, but not even
                the biggest schmuck buys two
                thousand dollars of this shit.


28   INT. INVESTOR'S CENTER - (LATER THAT) DAY       (DEC '87)         28

     As others Brokers bark into phones, Jordan sits, phone
     cradled in his shoulder, making notes. A few beats, then:

                              JORDAN
                     (into phone)
                Mr. Fleming, good morning, Jordan
                Belfort with Investor's Center in
                New York City. You recently
                responded to one of our ads...

     A few of the other Brokers glance over, eavesdropping.

                              JORDAN (CONT'D)
                The reason I'm calling is that
                an extremely exciting investment
                opportunity crossed my desk today.
                Typically our firm recommends no
                more than five stocks per year:
                this is one of them...

     A few more Brokers look over...

                              JORDAN (CONT'D)
                Aerotyne International is a
                cutting edge tech firm out of the
                Midwest, awaiting imminent patent
                approval on a new generation of
                radar equipment...

     LATER.   Now all the Brokers listen in rapt attention.
                                                              15.
      The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

                              JORDAN (CONT'D)
                -- so if Aerotyne's shares rise
                to only a dollar -- and our
                research indicates they could go
                much, much higher -- your profit
                on a mere three thousand dollar
                investment would be upwards of
                fifty thousand... That's right,
                you could pay off your mortgage.

     Seconds tick by; an eternity, then he starts writing:

                              JORDAN (CONT'D)
                Four thousand dollars, will
                that be check or money order?...
                Thank you, sir.

     Jordan hangs up, scrawls out a "buy" ticket.

                              JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                Just like that I made two grand.
                The other guys looked at me like
                I'd just discovered fire.

     Toby Welch and the other cave-Brokers stare at him.

                              TOBY WELCH
                How'd you fuckin' do that?


29   INT. INVESTOR'S CENTER - (ANOTHER) DAY (FEB `88)               29

     Jordan sits at his desk in mid-pitch, totally focused.

                              JORDAN
                It's a rock-solid company, sir,
                it's the next Microsoft...
                Six thousand. Terrific.

     As Jordan continues talking, wrapping up the sale...

                              JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                Though I knew I was selling
                garbage, within twelve weeks I
                was making a fortune.

     And as he starts scrawling out a buy ticket...

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                And as a wise man once told me,
                my only responsibility was to
                put meat on the table.

      Wearing a suit, Jordan sits in a booth reading the Wall
      Street Journal as a WAITRESS serves the food. DONNIE
      AZOFF, preppy-looking, 25, with horn-rims and bright
      white teeth approaches from the takeout counter.

                               DONNIE
                 That your Jag in the lot?

                                   JORDAN
                 Yeah.

                                   DONNIE
                 Nice ride.      Donnie Azoff.

                 I've seen it around. We live in
                 the same building. Twelfth floor?
                      (Jordan nods)
                 What do you do, bro?

                 Seventy grand last month.

                               DONNIE
                 Get the fuck out. You made
                 seventy grand in one month.

                               JORDAN
                 Seventy two actually.

      Donnie studies him, isn't sure if he's full of shit.

                               DONNIE
                 Tell you what. You show me a pay
                 stub with $72,000 on it, I'm
                 quitting my job right now and
                 coming to work with you.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                And he did quit his job, which
                I thought was a little weird.
                I mean I had just met this
                fucking guy.

     A few beats, then into phone:

                              DONNIE
                Yo Paulie, it's Donnie...     Yeah,
                listen, I quit.

     Jordan studies Donnie as he continues his conversation...

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                There were other things about him
                too, like his phosphorescent white
                teeth and the fact that he wore
                horn rims with clear lenses to
                look more Waspy. He also married
                his first cousin --

                              DONNIE
                No problem, if we have a kid who's
                a retard, we'll just leave it on
                the steps of some institution.

     And as they continue drinking...

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                He was also a closet drug fiend.
                I'd known him less than a week
                before he talked me into smoking
                crack.

     Jordan and Donnie get high. Donnie holds a flame under a
     crack pipe.
                                                                 18.
      The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages    3/5/13

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                The weird thing was when he'd do
                crack, his face would contort into
                this bizarre, frozen mask like the
                Phantom of the Opera.

     Donnie does a hit of crack; his jaw twitches, then his
     facial muscles contort, locking up like a stroke victim.
     After a few beats, he hands the pipe to Jordan.

                              DONNIE
                You now, take a hit!

     Jordan takes a deep hit and holds it.      A beat, then:

                              JORDAN
                Omigod, I fuckin' love you!!

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                I knew I had to make him my
                partner.


34   INT. INVESTOR'S CENTER - DAY     (SEP `88)                            34

     Jordan looks on as Donnie works the phone like a madman.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                Which turned out to be a great
                move - Donnie was a fast learner
                who transitioned into the penny
                stock business quickly.


35   EXT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO SHOP - DAY       (SEP `88)             35

     Jordan and Donnie pull up to a defunct auto body shop,
     which has a "For Lease" sign in the window.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                So within months we started our
                own firm out of an abandoned auto
                body shop.


36   INT. KACANDES DINER - DAY    (OCT `88)                                36

     Jordan sits with CHESTER MING, ROBBIE FEINBERG, ALDEN
     KUPFERBERG ("SEA OTTER") and BRAD, muscular and bald,
     with a Fu Manchu mustache.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                In addition to Donnie, I also
                recruited my friends Sea Otter,                        *
                Chester and Robbie, who were at                        *
                the time all middling pot dealers.
                                                               19.

     As a WAITRESS serves cheeseburgers:

                              JORDAN
                --see everyone wants to get rich,
                so you're already half way there
                by the time the call starts.

                              SEA OTTER
                I sold weed once to this Amish
                dude, had one of those beards with
                no mustache?

                                ROBBIE FEINBERG
                So?

                              SEA OTTER
                He only wanted to make furniture.

                              CHESTER MING
                What's that got to do with
                anything?

                              SEA OTTER
                He just said everyone wants to
                get rich.

                              ROBBIE FEINBERG
                     (to Jordan)
                That's true, you did.

                              SEA OTTER
                Buddhists too, they don't give a
                shit about money either.

                              CHESTER MING
                Man I could sell weed to anybody,
                get a convent full of nuns fucking
                wasted.

     And as Brad looks at Jordan and shakes his head:


37   INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO BODY SHOP - BULLPEN              37
     (OCT `88)

     We see the above guys working the phones.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                Brad, the guy I really wanted,
                took a pass, since he'd become the
                Quaalude king of Bayside.


38   EXT. BRAD'S HOUSE - BACKYARD GYM - DAY       (OCT `88)          38

     Bare-chested, wearing kung fu pants, Brad sells ludes to
     a couple of HIGH SCHOOL KIDS.

39   INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO BODY SHOP - BULLPEN - DAY         39
     (OCT `88)

     Jordan emerges from his office into the garage area
     (the bullpen), looking on as Donnie, Chester, Robbie, Sea
     Otter and four other BROKERS (now including RUGRAT and
     Toby) make sales calls from the cheap desks.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                Give me them young, hungry and
                stupid and in no time I'll make
                them rich.


40   EXT. MARINA - LONG ISLAND - SUNSET        (MAY `89)              40

     On lounge chairs at the edge of a dock, bottle of wine
     nearby, Jordan sits with Teresa. He smiles as she opens
     a jewelry case -- inside is a diamond tennis bracelet.

                               TERESA
                Omigod.   Jordan.

                                  JORDAN
                You like it?

                              TERESA
                It's beautiful.

     Jordan helps her try it on.       She smiles, but he detects a
     wave of... something.

                              JORDAN
                They're small, I know, but the
                stones are really high quality.

                               TERESA
                No, no.   I love it.

                                  JORDAN
                Then what?

     They sit in silence.       Finally:

                              TERESA
                I don't know, it's just -- these
                stocks, these crappy companies.

                              JORDAN
                In five years the Corleone family
                will be completely legitimate.
                                                               21.
       The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

                               TERESA
                 Why can't you be legitimate now?

                               JORDAN
                 It's not illegal, Teresa,
                 technically. I mean they're real
                 stocks, they're just...

                               TERESA
                 Never gonna make anybody money.
                      (a few beats; then)
                 Wouldn't you feel better selling
                 this junk to rich people, who can
                 afford to lose the money at least?

                               JORDAN
                 Rich people don't buy penny
                 stocks.

                                 TERESA
                 Why not?

      And on Jordan's look:

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 Because they're too smart, that's
                 why not.

      (MAR `90)

      The camera PUSHES IN on Jordan as he stands before a
      large dry erase board.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 But what if they didn't sound like
                 jerk-offs? What if I took this
                 bunch of nincompoops and molded
                 them in my own image? I
                 reinvented the company, gave it a
                 new image, a new name. Something
                 patrician, blue-blooded, something
                 that reeked of tradition and anti-
                 semitism.

      And as his Brokers settle in to folding chairs--

                               JORDAN
                 Gentlemen, welcome to Stratton
                 Oakmont.   The clients we've gone
                 after in the past -- they're done.
                 We will now target exclusively the
                 wealthiest one percent of
                 Americans. The methods we've used
                 -- over. Loud, obnoxious sales
                 hype is worthless with these
                 people.
                                                              23.
      The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13
                              JORDAN (CONT'D)
                In military terms it's like carpet-
                bombing -- noisy, menacing and
                only marginally effective. As
                Stratton brokers you will be laser-
                guided smart-bombs aimed at high-
                priority targets. You will
                establish an initial relationship
                with your clients selling only
                blue chip stocks -- then and only
                then will you attempt to sell the
                pink sheets, where the real money
                is. Now the key to every sale is
                this:

     Jordan writes the word "URGENCY" on the board.

                              JORDAN (CONT'D)
                No one buys stock unless he thinks
                it's going up and going up now.
                You must convince your client to
                buy before the takeover happens,
                before the lawsuit is settled,
                before the patent is granted.
                If he says I'll think about it and
                call you back, it's over, you're
                dead! No one calls back! So you
                have to create urgency --


48   INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO SHOP BULLPEN - DAY              48

     Another day. With Stratton Oakmont signage visible in
     the b.g., Jordan is on speakerphone with a potential
     CLIENT, the other Brokers listening in.

                              JORDAN
                --and once Kodak settles the
                lawsuit, institutions will be
                permitted to buy their shares in
                large blocks again. And when that
                happens, which is any day now,
                what do you think will happen to
                the price of Kodak stock?

                                CLIENT   (O.S.)
                It'll go up?

                              JORDAN
                Exactly. Which is why you should
                pick up 5000 shares today, a
                $200,000 investment.

                starts. You as a salesman are
                almost hoping he says no so you
                can finally do your fucking job!

                He doesn't know, he needs to
                think, he's gotta ask his wife!
                The fact is it doesn't matter what
                the fuck he says! If he's already
                agreed that the stock's going up,
                then the only real objection he
                has at this point is he doesn't
                trust you! And he shouldn't trust
                you, you're a fucking salesman!
                So what do you say?

                              DONNIE
                Let me ask you this, sir -- had I
                been your broker for the past
                three to four years and made you
                money on a consistent basis, you
                probably wouldn't say you need to
                think about it, you'd probably say
                pick me up three or four thousand
                shares, am I right?

                                CLIENT #2 (O.S.)

     The place is crowded; now 20 Brokers make up the sales
     force. Sea Otter pitches a client.

                Wait a second. You mean to tell
                me if I put you in Union Carbide

      New offices now, a real brokerage firm. The bullpen is
      large, with 75 Brokers at polished maple desks, sitting
      before computers talking into headsets.

                               DONNIE
                 So the problem is that I don't
                 have the luxury of a track record.

                 The downside is minimal and the

      4PM the place goes nuts as Jordan emerges from his office            *
      holding a spread sheet. He addresses the crowd of 100
      BROKERS, which now includes a dozen WOMEN.

                And to celebrate with a weekly act
                of debauchery, I have offered our

                Harrison ten thousand dollars to                    *
                have her head shaved!

     Jordan motions to DANIELLE HARRISON, 19, pretty, sitting       *
     in a chair nearby. Behind her, Rugrat uses clippers to
     shave her thick brown mane. The place goes nuts.

                              JORDAN (CONT'D)
                FYI, Danielle tells me she's using
                the money for breast implants! Is
                this a great company or what?!!

     More wild applause as Jordan signals across the bullpen
     to Donnie. We hear the opening strains of "Stars &
     Stripes Forever" as he opens the door to a

     COLLEGE MARCHING BAND

     dressed in underwear and hats. The music continues as
     somersaulting GYMNASTS and BATON-TWIRLERS bring up the
     rear. As they march through the bullpen to cheers--

     FROM THE KITCHEN -- two dozen TUXEDO-CLAD WAITERS emerge
     carrying trays of champagne and hors d'oeuvres. The
     music continues as two dozen STRIPPERS bolt in, gyrating
     among the BROKERS. As Jordan surveys the insanity:

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                Word spread throughout Wall
                Street -- I was becoming a legend.
                Forbes Magazine even called to do

     three dozen YOUNG MEN in business suits. He approaches
     his assistant JANET, 20s, dressed all in black.

                Forbes had made me a superstar.
                Every day dozens of money-crazed
                kids beat a path to my door with
                resumes they hadn't even bothered
                to spellcheck.

     Jordan crosses through the packed bullpen, where 150
     BROKERS, no older than 22, are crammed elbow to elbow
     talking into phones. Some have pets, which they tend to
     while they work -- iguanas, snakes, turtles, even a
     chimp. Others are getting shoulder rubs by Masseuses
     or being fitted for suits by a TAILOR. Over the above:

                new suit from our in-house tailor.
                The median age of our brokerage

                 I had to declare the office a fuck-
                 free zone between the hours of 9
                 and 7, but even that didn't help.

      Taped to the mirror we see a MEMO -- inside a red circle,
      two anatomically correct stick figures fuck doggy-style,
      a red line slashing through them.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 Actually the madness started on
                 our very first day, when one of
                 our brokers, Ben Jenner,
                 christened the elevator by
                 getting a blowjob from a sales
                 assistant.

      Two dozen Brokers cheer, watching through the rising
      glass elevator as BEN JENNER, 25, gets a blowjob from a
      brunette SALES ASSISTANT.                                      *

                 Her name was Pam and   to her
                 credit, she did have   an amazing
                 technique, with this   wild twist
                 and jerk motion.

      As Pam blows Jordan, Donnie fucks her from behind.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 Eventually Ben married her, which
                 was pretty amazing considering she
                 blew every guy in the office.

      bathroom floor, a gun near his head, which oozes blood.

                 Anyway, in an attempt to maintain
                 order, I hired my dad Max as
                 defacto CFO and head of the
                 Gestapo.


75C   INT. JORDAN'S PARENTS' APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT         75C

      MAX BELFORT sits smoking, watching a rerun of "The
      Equalizer" on TV. His wife, LEAH, does needlepoint.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 We called him Mad Max because of
                 his hair-trigger temper, which
                 could be set off by something as
                 innocuous as a ringing telephone.

      The phone RINGS.

                               MAX
                 Who the hell has the goddamn gall
                 to call this house on a Tuesday
                 evening! Goddammit!

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 But then the weirdest thing would
                 happen. Though he'd never been
                 near England, he'd pick up the
                 phone and affect an ever-so-slight
                 British accent.

      Greatly agitated, Max stomps toward the phone.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 This was his other persona -- the
                 super polite, ever-gracious Sir
                 Max.

                               MAX
                      (into phone)
                 Hello?... Yes, Gene, right-eo.
                 Good-good then... Cheerio.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 It was absolutely bizarre. He'd
                 hang up...

                               MAX
                      (hangs up phone)
                 Goddamn fucking halfwit!
                                                              33.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                And become Mad Max all over again.

     Max curses a blue streak as he stomps back to his chair.

     Holding a HEADSHOT of the Dwarf from the opening, Jordan
     sits talking with Donnie, Robbie and Rugrat.

                we can go... I mean we can throw                    *

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 In Stratton parlance, there were
                 three kinds of hookers. There
                 were blue chips, the top of the
                 line. Model material. They were
                 priced between $300 and $500 and
                 made you wear a condom unless you
                 gave them a hefty tip, which I
                 always did.

                 Then came NASDAQs, who were
                 pretty, but not great, usually
                 in the two to three hundred
                 dollar range.

                 They usually cost a hundred or

                 condom, you'd get a penicillin
                 shot the next day and pray your

                 Give us a minute, will you, guys?

      He closes the door, then stretches a bit, exaggeratedly,
      letting out a little moan.

79A   QUAALUDE TUTORIAL                                              *79A

      CUT TO: Extreme close up of guys doing drugs.                  *

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 The quaalude was first synthesized
                 in 1951 by an Indian doctor --
                 that's dot Indian, not feathers --
                 as a sedative, and was prescribed
                 to stressed housewives with sleep
                 disorders. Pretty soon someone
                 figured out that if you resisted
                 the urge to sleep for fifteen
                 minutes, you got a pretty kick-ass
                 high from it. Didn't take long
                 for people to start abusing ludes,
                 `course, and in 1982 the U.S.
                 Government Schedule One'd them,
                 along with the rest of the world.
                 Which meant there was only a
                 finite amount of these things
                 left. No shit, you can't even

                         DONNIE
           Ssshhhhoes... shhhoooess...

Jordan suspects Donnie may actually be onto something.
But just then...

                           SEA OTTER
           Holy fuck.

Jordan peers over the balcony where Sea Otter's looking.

NAOMI LAPAGLIA. 22, the hottest blonde ever, has entered
the party with her date BLAIR. She smiles, full lips
parting over perfect white teeth, a ridiculously short
dress barely covering her long tan legs and full breasts.

                         RUGRAT
           My nutsack's about to explode.

                         ROBBIE                                *
           Someone's gotta take that down.

There's no debate who that someone should be. Eyes
locked on Naomi, Jordan makes his way downstairs.

WITH NAOMI taking in the party, her eyes flitting to
things: art, chandeliers, crystal, etc.

                         NAOMI (V.O.)
           A lotta people would look at me
           and think: "golddigger, she's out
           to land the richest husband she
           can." But you see, I came from
           nothing. Like, below the poverty
           line. And when you come from
           nothing, being rich means never
           having to go back to that.

Jordan approaches CRISTY, 20s, one of his guests.

                         CRISTY
           Jordan, hey.
                (he smiles; Cristy
                 picks up his intent)
           Have you met my friend Naomi?

Jordan takes Naomi's hand, doesn't let go.

                           JORDAN
           Naomi.

                         NAOMI
           You have an awesome house. I
           don't think I've ever been in a
           house like this.
                                                          43.

                         JORDAN
           You like it? I just got it. I
           guess it's okay. Six bedrooms,
           two hot-tubs, one off the master
           suite overlooking the water. You
           like to jet-ski?

Naomi's date Blair offers his hand to break them apart.
Toby Welch lurks behind him, giving him the evil-eye.

                          BLAIR
           Hi.   Blair Hollingsworth.

Jordan barely acknowledges him, focused on Naomi.

Outside, HILDY AZOFF chats with Teresa. Her eyes stray
to Jordan chatting up Naomi. Teresa's eyes follow hers
and sees them. Ouch. Hildy goes.

                         JORDAN
           You're telling me you've never jet-
           ski'ed in your life?!

                           NAOMI
           Never.

                         BLAIR
           Y'know, we really should hit it,
           there's two other parties we're
           s'posed to get to --

                           JORDAN
           What?    You just got here.   Stay.

Naomi looks like she'd like to.     Hildy approaches,
introduces herself, then:

                         HILDY
           Jordan, Teresa needs your help.

                           JORDAN
           With what?

                         HILDY
           I dunno, you'll have to ask your
           wife what she wants.

Jordan sees: Teresa is watching from afar.

                         DONNIE(O.S.)
           Oh sweet Jesus!

Jordan turns to see a drunk Donnie, cock in hand, jerking
off to Naomi. Hildy comes running over.
                                                                   44.
      The Wolf of Wall Street     Buff Revised Pages    3/5/13

                               HILDY
                Donnie!   What the fuck are you
                doing?!

     During the melee that follows -- Hildy admonishing
     Donnie, Blair removing Naomi from the party --

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                The day I met Naomi was the day I
                truly became the Wolf. Every guy
                wanted her -- so I had to have
                her.

     -- Jordan watches her go. Naomi shoots a glance back to
     him and, like that, he's hooked.

82   INT. SIGN OF THE DOVE - MANHATTAN - NIGHT         (JUN `92)         82

     Romantic; elegant. Over a bottle of `53 Lafite, Jordan
     sits in mid conversation with Naomi, who is stunning in a
     low-cut black cocktail dress.

                                  JORDAN
                Bay Ridge.      That's near Staten
                Island?

                              NAOMI
                Brooklyn, across the Verrazano
                Bridge. Guinea gulch. Ever been?

                              JORDAN
                You're Italian?

                              NAOMI
                My dad's side. Also Dutch,
                German, English -- I'm a mutt.
                Actually I have family over there,
                in London. My Aunt Emma.

                              JORDAN
                That explains it then.

                                  NAOMI
                What?

                              JORDAN
                     (smiles)
                You're a Duchess. The Duchess of
                Bay Ridge.

     Naomi smiles, flags a passing WAITER.
                                                              45.
      The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

                              NAOMI
                Could I have a straw please?

     The Waiter nods, heads off.     A few beats, then:

                              NAOMI (CONT'D)
                So I was a little surprised you
                asked Cristy for my number.

                                JORDAN
                How come?

                              NAOMI
                Aren't you married?

                              JORDAN
                Married people can't have friends?

     Naomi smiles. The Waiter brings the straw. She opens
     it, slips it in her red wine glass. Off Jordan's look:

                              NAOMI
                So I don't stain my teeth.

     And as she sips the wine seductively through the straw...


83   EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - NIGHT                                   83

     Jordan's Ferrari makes its way over the bridge, heading
     back toward Brooklyn.

                              NAOMI (O.S.)
                --then at night I do my designs.


84   INT. JORDAN'S FERRARI - CONTINUOUS                             84

     Jordan drives, Naomi next to him.

                              NAOMI
                An entire line of lingerie --
                camisoles, bustiers, panties.

     Jordan glances over -- her dress is riding up her thigh.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                She designs panties?! Jesus
                fucking Christ!

     Naomi smiles.

                              JORDAN
                Sounds like something I might
                invest in. Venture capital.
                                                                46.
      The Wolf of Wall Street    Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

                              NAOMI
                Well we should definitely keep in
                touch, then.

                                 JORDAN
                Absolutely.

     He pulls over outside her brownstone.

                                 NAOMI
                That's me.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                Think, Jordan, think! How can you
                get up to her apartment?!

     They look at each other.     We can almost hear Jordan's
     heart pounding.

                              NAOMI
                You wanna come up for some tea?


85   INT. NAOMI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                   85

     A small, cozy apartment. Naomi enters, Jordan close
     behind. She picks up Rocky, her yapping Maltese.

                                 NAOMI
                Say hi, Rocky.

     Naomi waves Rocky's paw.     Jordan smiles.

                              NAOMI (CONT'D)
                Why don't you light a fire? I'll
                be right out.

     Jordan nods, takes in her scent as she walks away.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                God, please help me. How can I
                fuck this girl?

     As he crouches by the fireplace, his skypager vibrates.
     He checks the readout: "Teresa". His face falls as he
     hits the "silent" button, mind racing with guilt.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                That's it, you're leaving. You're
                going home to your wife.

     Jordan stands, turns around -- NAOMI is in the doorway,
     naked except for high heels.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                As you can probably guess, I
                fucked her goddamn brains out.
                                                               47.

86   INT. NAOMI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                    86

     Rocky yaps incessantly as Jordan pounds away atop Naomi.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                For eleven seconds.

     Jordan cums loudly, convulsively.

                                 JORDAN
                I'm sorry, I--

                                 NAOMI
                Did you cum?

                              JORDAN
                     (nods; gasping)
                Yeah, but I'm still hard.

     Jordan looks down at her.

                              JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                Being inside her... was like your
                cock went to heaven and God
                himself was cupping your balls.

     And as they start fucking again...


87   INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - JORDAN'S OFFICE - DAY               87
     (JUN `92)

     Jordan sits at his desk, telephone to his ear.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                I couldn't get enough.


88   INT. NAOMI'S APARTMENT - DAY        (JUN `92)                   88

     CLOSE ON Naomi, who talks on the phone, smiling. We PULL
     BACK to see the apartment is packed with flowers.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                Every chance we got, we'd sneak
                off together...


89   INT. LIMOSINE - NIGHT (AUG `92)                                 89

     Giggling like a child, Jordan pours coke from a vial,
     creating a little mound atop one of Naomi's breasts.

                              JORDAN
                Hold still, don't move.
                     (to the Driver)
                Watch the potholes!
                                                                  48.
      The Wolf of Wall Street     Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

     More giggling, then he snorts the coke off her breast,
     burying his face in it as he climbs on top of her. Naomi
     laughs uncontrollably as the limo glides to a stop. The
     door opens from outside -- the Doorman?

                              TERESA (O.S.)
                Get out of the fucking car.

     Jordan looks up, locks eyes with Teresa. He jumps off
     Naomi, stumbles out, closing the door behind himself.


90   EXT. JORDAN'S MANHATTAN APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS            90

                JORDAN                             TERESA
     What are you doing home?           That whore from the party?
                                        How could you do this to
                                        me?!

     The limo takes off.    Teresa starts crying...

                              JORDAN
                I thought you were at the beach
                house, I--

                              TERESA
                I married you when you had
                nothing--

                              JORDAN
                Teresa... I don't know what to
                say.

                              TERESA
                You're like a totally different
                person.

                               JORDAN
                I'm not. I'm sorry.        I made a
                mistake, okay?

                              TERESA
                Tell me you don't love her.

                                  JORDAN

                     (off his silence)
                Jordan?

     Jordan says nothing.       Finally, Teresa starts sobbing.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                I felt horrible.

     Jordan holds her, letting her cry.
                                                                49.

                Three days later I filed for
                divorce and moved Naomi into the
                apartment.


91   INT. JORDAN'S MANHATTAN APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - DUSK            91
     (SEP `92)

     Completely remodelled, all new furniture.   Jordan and
     Naomi sit at the table, set for a candle-light dinner.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                Say what you will, but the Duchess
                did have style. She brought in a
                decorator, feng shui'd the place--
                she even hired a gay butler.

     NICHOLAS THE BUTLER, 40s, enters with hot towels on a
     silver tray.

                              JORDAN
                Thank you, Nicholas.

     Jordan takes a towel, wipes his face.      Naomi smiles.

                              JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                He was smart, sophisticated,

95   INT. JORDAN'S MANHATTAN APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT          * 95

     A GAY ORGY is in progress, a dozen naked MEN, including
     Nicholas, in various sexual positions about the room.

                                NAOMI
                Omigod!


96   INT. JORDAN'S MANHATTAN APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT           96

     Jordan sits across from a very shaken Naomi.

                              NAOMI
                He must have thought I was at my
                mother's.

                Where were they? In the bedroom?

     A beat, then Jordan realizes.     He jumps off the couch
     like it's on fire.

                              NAOMI (CONT'D)
                It gets worse. After I chased
                them out, I checked the apartment.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                The motherfucker stole fifty grand

97   INT. JORDAN'S MANHATTAN APARTMENT - LIBRARY - DAY                97
     (OCT `92)

     With Nicholas seated in a chair, Jordan sits across from
     him. Pacing behind him is Donnie, coked-up, face
     contorted, frothing with rage. Nearby, giant Chester
     Ming sits quietly, saying nothing.

                              JORDAN
                I just want my stuff back, okay?

                              NICHOLAS THE BUTLER
                I didn't take anything.

                              DONNIE
                     (in his face)
                I should kill you, cocksucker!
                You do not fuck with this man!

     Jordan holds Donnie off.    Turns back to Nicholas.

                              JORDAN
                You were high, things got out of
                control, I get it. Believe me I
                do, I have a Phd in debauchery.

                              NICHOLAS THE BUTLER
                I didn't do it.

                              DONNIE
                I'll knock your fuckin' teeth out,
                motherfucker!

                              JORDAN

                the jewelry, and we'll forget the
                whole thing.

                              NICHOLAS THE BUTLER
                It's because I'm gay, isn't it?

                Nicholas. You could fuck a baby
                sheep as far as I care, on my
                brand new fucking sofa. What I
                won't stand for is being robbed.

                              NICHOLAS THE BUTLER
                I'm telling you the truth.

                              JORDAN
                I'll ask you one last time.

                              DONNIE
                You're dead, you piece of shit!

                              NICHOLAS THE BUTLER
                Jordan, please.

                                JORDAN
                Fine.

     Jordan nods to Chester. Without a word, he crosses to
     Nicholas and BAMMM!! Nicholas's nose splits open like a
     ripe plum, blood spurting everywhere. Tough-guy Donnie
     takes one look, then SPEWS vomit into a garbage pail.
     And as Chester pummels Nicholas's face into chopped
     meat...

                              JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                It's amazing the kind of loyalty
                money will buy. I mean Chester
                almost killed this prick.

     Chester starts to hang Nicholas over the balcony by his
     legs. Jordan stops him.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                I finally called the cops, mainly
                to save Nicholas's life.


98   INT. JORDAN'S MANHATTAN APARTMENT - FOYER - DAY                98

     With the bloodied Nicholas in the background, Jordan
     talks to two NYPD COPS, handing them each a wad of cash.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                I gave them each a thousand bucks
                and told them what Nicholas had
                done. Then they kicked his ass.

     As the Cops swat Nicholas with their nightsticks:


                COP #1                           COP #2
     Fuckin' thief, huh?              Piece of shit.

      And as they hustle Nicholas out...

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 Loyalty, like I said. Which was
                 the key component to my incredible
                 fucking success.


98A   EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY (OCT `92)                               98A

      As Jordan golfs with Donnie, Chester, Robbie, Toby and         *
      some hookers, Brad pulls up in a golf cart with a cash-        *
      filled gym bag.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 Besides Brad, I had eight other
                 `ratholes', close friends who'd
                 own stock on paper, but kick the
                 profits back to me after I drove
                 the price through the roof.

      They hug, then Jordan adds the gym bag to several others
      on the back of his golf cart. Donnie tries to befriend
      Brad; Brad isn't interested.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 The SEC knew I was doing something
                 shady, but they couldn't figure
                 out what the fuck it was.

Just then, Max spots a BROKER break-dancing as three
other Brokers look on...

                         MAX
           What the fuck is this imbecile
           doing?!

Max crosses off, starts screaming at the break-dancing
Broker. Jordan keeps walking with Manny.

                         JORDAN (V.O.)
           The SEC sent two lawyers down to
           review our files, so I set them
           up in our conference room.

Jordan passes the conference room, looks in the window--
two SEC ATTORNEYS wear coats as they review documents.

                         JORDAN (V.O.)
           Then I had it bugged and the air
           conditioning locked till it felt
           like Antarctica in there.

One of the SEC Attorneys blows into his hands for warmth.
Manny follows Jordan toward the bullpen, his frenzied
Brokers working the phones.

                         JORDAN (V.O.)
           So here they were, looking for a
           smoking gun while I was firing a
           bazooka right under their noses.
           It was our first IPO, and we were
           driving the stock price to the
           fucking moon.

           Arncliffe National, it's on fire!

                (to Sales Assistant)
           Arncliffe National, ten thousand
           shares!

Jordan speaks directly to camera as he continues walking
through the bullpen.

                         JORDAN
           See an IPO is an initial public

      wipes it off, smiling.

                 I lived through the 60s, my dear.
                 Enjoy the day.

      And with that, she turns back to Naomi.


112   EXT. BAHAMAS - MARINA - DAY       (DEC `92)                      112

      With Naomi wearing a blindfold, Jordan leads her to the
      end of a long dock, expensive yachts moored everywhere.

                                  JORDAN
                 Careful now.     You ready?

      Jordan removes her blindfold -- there, towering above the
      others, is a stunning, 120 foot yacht.
                                                                       57.

                      What is this?

                                    JORDAN
                      Your wedding present.       Check out
                      the name.

           She does; it's called "Naomi".     As she squeals, hugs him-

113        INT. YACHT NAOMI - DAY     (DEC `92)                              113

           The camera PUSHES IN past a white-jacketed STEWARD,
           who opens the door to the yacht's main salon; next we see
           the living room, with its full bar and leather couches;
           then the bedroom, with a king bed and monogrammed sheets.

                      Long Island, where we'd bought a
                      house.


114        EXT. CARIBBEAN - OPEN OCEAN - DAY       (DEC `92 - JAN `93)       114

           The Naomi sails the calm waters, Jordan and Naomi popping
           ludes, sunbathing blissfully on the deck.

116   INT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY (FEB `95)            116

      Amid billowing piles of white Chinese silk, Jordan sleeps
      on his back, snoring blissfully.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                 It   was heaven on earth.

      On screen WE SEE:

                          18 MONTHS LATER

      Splash!   A glass of water hits him in the face.

                               NAOMI
                 Wake up, you bag of shit!

      Soaking wet, Jordan sits upright to see Naomi standing
      over him in a tiny pink chemise, holding an empty glass.

                               JORDAN
                 The fuck are you doing?!

                                   NAOMI
                 Who's Venice?

                                   JORDAN
                 What?!

                               NAOMI
                 Who is she?! Some little hooker
                 you fucked last night?

                                   JORDAN
                 What?    No!    Naomi!

      And as Naomi storms off for a re-fill...


117   INT. HOTEL ROOM - THE NIGHT BEFORE        (FEB `95)              117

      Jordan lies on the ground, hands tied with a lit candle          *
      up his ass.                                                      *

      VENICE, A Blue Chip Hooker, enters, pulls out a candle           *
      and straddles him. She drips wax on his back and pulls           *
      his hair.                                                        *


118   INT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY (FEB `95)            118

      Back to scene. Naomi holds another full glass, rocking
      back and forth on the balls of her feet like a fighter.
                                                                59.

                               NAOMI
                 You were calling her name in your
                 sleep!

                               JORDAN
                 I can explain everything.

                               NAOMI
                 Go ahead. More lies from the man
                 who lies for a living!

                               JORDAN
                 No, really. Donnie and me, we're
                 investing in a condo development
                 in Venice.

                                 NAOMI
                 Italy?!

                               JORDAN
                 California, baby.

                                 NAOMI
                 Yeah, right.

                               JORDAN
                 Duchess, come on.

                               NAOMI
                 Don't `Duchess' me, you scumbag.
                 You think I don't know what you're
                 up to? You're a father now and
                 you act like an infant!

      Splash!   She nails him again, crosses for more water.

                                 JORDAN
                 Fuck. Naomi!    Why are you so mad?

                               NAOMI
                 Where do you want me to start?
                 How about you flying in here on
                 your stupid helicopter at three in
                 the morning waking up Skylar?!


119   EXT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - YARD - NIGHT      (FEB `95)              119

      Jordan crash-lands the helicopter on the driving range.         *
      He exits, gives Captain Dave a salute, fights his way           *
      through the bushes, then stumbles toward the house and          *
      falls into the pool, stoned out of his skull. Security          *
      floodlights come on and the alarm sounds.                       *
                                                               60.

                               NAOMI (O.S.)
                 Does it even matter to you that I
                 just had that driving range sodded
                 with Bermuda grass?


120   INT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY (FEB `95)          120

      Back to scene.   Naomi holds another glass of water.

                               NAOMI
                 But why should you give a shit?
                 You're not the one who researched
                 the fucking thing and dealt with
                 the fucking golf course people!

                               JORDAN
                 You're an aspiring landscape
                 architect?! But what happened to
                 wine connoisseur? Oh wait, that
                 was last month!

                                 NAOMI
                 Fuck you!

      Naomi winds up with the water glass. Jordan stands tall,
      puffs himself up, arms flexed at his sides.

                                NAOMI (CONT'D)
                 Stop flexing your arms, you look
                 like a fucking imbecile.
                       (re: his crotch)
                 And don't think that impresses me
                 much.

      Jordan looks down: he has a morning erection.

                               JORDAN
                 I wasn't flexing my arms. You're
                 just lucky to have a husband who's
                 in such great shape. Now get over
                 here and kiss me!

                                 NAOMI
                 Kiss you?!

      Splash! She nails him one last time, then storms out.
      He stands there dripping wet. To his erection:

                               JORDAN
                 Where the fuck were you last
                 night?

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 My morning ritual. First I'd get
                 up and fight with Naomi about
                 whatever I did the night before.
                                                                  61.

120A   INT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - STEAM SHOWER - DAY                        120A

       Jordan stands in the steaming shower.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                  Next it was a steam so I could
                  sweat out whatever drugs were
                  still in my system.


120B   INT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - MASTER BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS              120B

       Jordan looks at himself in the mirror.      His eyes are
       bloodshot - he looks like shit.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                  After that I'd assess the damage.

       Jordan looks at a Visine bottle - "Recommended Dosage -
       Two Drops". He squirts six drops in each eye.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                  What kind of maniac abuses eye
                  drops?


121    INT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - DRESSING ROOM - DAY (FEB `95)             121

       Fully dressed and standing amid hundreds of suits, Jordan
       pops two white pills, swigs some juice.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                  Then I'd get dressed, take my
                  "back pills" to get me started,
                  then attempt to make up with her.


122    INT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - SKYLAR'S ROOM - DAY (FEB `95)             122

       Jordan enters the tiny pink wonderland. On the fluffy
       pink carpet is Naomi, now in a minidress hiked above her
       hips, Manolo Blahniks showing polished red toes. Between
       her legs sits SKYLAR, their 5-month-old daughter.

                                  JORDAN
                  Hey, Skylar.

                                 NAOMI
                        (little girl voice)
                  Good morning Daddy. Where's my
                  kiss?

       Jordan kisses the baby, picks her up.
                                                         62.
 The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

                         JORDAN
                (playing along)
           Does Daddy get to kiss both his
           girls?

                         NAOMI
           Ohhh, no! Daddy doesn't even get
           to touch Mommy for a very, very
           long time.

Naomi lays back on her elbows, thighs parted - she's
wearing no panties. The wind goes out of Jordan.

                         JORDAN
           C'mon, Nay, please. You know how
           sorry I am. I swear I--

                         NAOMI
                (cutting him off)
           Daddy shouldn't waste his time.
           And from now on it's going to be
           nothing but short, short skirts
           around the house! And Mommy's
           so sick and tired of wearing
           panties, uhhh. In fact she's
           decided to throw them all away.
                (parting her thighs)
           So take a good look. You'll be
           seeing an awful lot of it around
           the house, but no touching.

She licks her lips seductively.     Jordan sets Skylar
aside, starts grovelling.

                         NAOMI (CONT'D)
           What's wrong, Daddy?

Naomi slips her index finger in her mouth, starts sucking
it. Jordan can barely speak.

                         JORDAN
           C'mon, why are you doing this?
           I said I'm sorry.

                         NAOMI
                (pouting)
           Ohhhh poor, poor Dada. He loves to
           say how wrong he is when he's
           ready to come in his own pants.
           Isn't that right Dada? Mommy loves
           Daddy so, so much and there's
           nothing she wants to do more right
           now than to make love to Daddy all
           day long. Well, I guess it's time
           for Daddy to be taught his first
           lesson.
                                                                  63.
       The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages     3/5/13

      Naomi runs her fingers over her stomach and on to her
      inner thigh, then up toward her vagina. Jordan watches
      transfixed, then a change comes over him...

                               JORDAN
                 I wouldn't do that if I were you
                 Mommy. I think Mommy should hear a
                 story before she decides to please
                 herself like that.
                 Can Daddy tell Mommy a story?
                      (off her nod)
                 And does mommy promise to keep her
                 legs spread wide, wide open the
                 whole time?
                      (she nods dreamily)
                 Good. Once upon a time there was
                 a great big mansion in Long Island
                 and the people who lived there had
                 lots and lots of money. But of
                 all the possessions they had,
                 there was one thing that was much
                 more valuable than all the rest
                 combined, and that was their
                 little baby daughter.

      Naomi listens, legs still spread, hand on her crotch.

                               JORDAN (CONT'D)
                 Now because he was very security-
                 conscious, the Daddy hired two
                 full-time guards, big hairy men
                 both named Rocco, and they
                 installed security cameras all
                 around the house. And one of
                 those cameras is right over
                 Daddy's shoulder.

      Naomi's eyes widen -- she look toward a Teddy Bear on a
      shelf. WE SEE that one of the eyes is a pinhole camera.

                               JORDAN (CONT'D)
                 So smile, Mommy! You're on Candid
                 Camera!


123   INT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - GUARD HOUSE - DAY        (FEB `95)         123

      Mesmerized, ROCCO DAY watches a video screen, on which we
      see a grainy image of Naomi, hand between her legs.


124   INT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - SKYLAR'S BEDROOM - DAY (FEB `95)           124

      Naomi jumps up as if she's been electrocuted.

                                 NAOMI
                 You asshole!
                                                                64.

      As she bolts from the room, Jordan plays with Skylar...

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 The good thing about living with
                 a world-class ballbreaker is they
                 make all the other ballbreakers in
                 your life a little easier to take.


125   INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - OUTSIDE JORDAN'S OFFICE - DAY       125
      (FEB `95)

      Donnie stands talking with Jordan's assistant, Janet.
      Jordan approaches under a head of steam.

                                  DONNIE
                 There he is.

                               JORDAN
                      (a quick hug; then)
                 Steve here yet?

                                  DONNIE
                 On his way.     Very excited.

                                JORDAN
                 Good.   Cuz we have a problem.

      He indicates out to the Bullpen.      Donnie and Janet look.

                               JANET
                      (incredulous)
                 Is he wearing a bow tie?

      In the Bullpen WE SEE a young Stratton Broker in a bowtie
      cleaning a small goldfish bowl on his desk.

                               JORDAN
                 He's got nothing better to do on
                 the day of the biggest IPO in this
                 firm's history?!

      Jordan watches as Donnie marches toward the Broker in a
      bowtie...


126   INT. BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS                                       126

                               DONNIE
                 The fuck you doing?

                               BROKER IN A BOWTIE
                      (bewildered)
                 Cleaning my fishbowl.

                                  DONNIE
                 Oh.
                                                                65.
        The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

       Donnie nods, turns to go, but suddenly he turns back and
       thrusts his arm in the bowl, grabbing for the squirming
       goldfish. The Broker in a bowtie looks on, horrified.

                                DONNIE(CONT'D)
                  On new issue day?! On
                  cocksucking, motherfucking
                  new issue day?!

       Dozen of Brokers and Sales Assistants look over as Donnie
       snatches up the fish. Holding it by its tail, he jumps         *
       up on the desk of the Broker in a bowtie. Now the entire
       Bullpen looks over.

                                DONNIE(CONT'D)
                  This is what happens when you fuck
                  with your pets on new issue day!

       With the flair of a showman, Donnie pops the fish in his
       mouth, swallowing it whole. The Brokers cheer wildly.
       Donnie jumps down, gets in the face of the Broker in a
       bowtie:

                                DONNIE(CONT'D)
                  Now take your bowtie, get your
                  shit and get the fuck out!

       Bowtie is stunned. And as Donnie storms off, we PUSH IN
       on Jordan, watching from across the room.


127    INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - JORDAN'S OFFICE - DAY              127
       (FEB `95)

       Jordan finishes a phone call as Donnie enters with STEVE
       MADDEN, 30s, dressed in wrinkled navy blazer, cargo pants
       and T-shirt, a baseball cap over his scraggly, thinning
       hair. Jordan smiles, crosses to greet him.

                                  JORDAN
                  The Cobbler.    Ready to get rich?

                                  STEVE MADDEN
                  Hey buddy.

       And as they ad lib greetings, settle in at the couch:

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                  Steve Madden, the shoe designer,
                  was a childhood friend of
                  Donnie's, but I didn't hold that
                  against him. Remember those ads,
                  those giant-headed girls with bug
                  eyes wearing those big clunky
                  shoes?

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 He came to me a few years earlier
                 when he was just starting out, so
                 I became a silent partner in his
                 company, buying an 85% stake for
                 only a million bucks.


128   INT. STEVE MADDEN SHOES - DAY                                     128

      WE SEE various stores, all packed with teenage GIRLS
      buying shoes and boots.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 The company blew up and we were
                 now taking it public. It was the
                 biggest deal we'd ever done and
                 the hottest IPO on Wall Street.


129   INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - JORDAN'S OFFICE - DAY                 129
      (FEB `95)

      Jordan and Donnie sit with Steve Madden in mid-
      conversation.

                               DONNIE
                 --which is why they need to meet
                 you.

                               JORDAN
                 You gotta get `em fired up so
                 they'll push the shit out of this
                 stock.

                               DONNIE
                 Let them feel your passion.


130   INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - DAY       (FEB `95)         130

      Bustling with activity. With Jordan and Donnie looking
      on from nearby, Steve Madden approaches a microphone on
      the raised platform, in his hands several shoe boxes.

                               STEVE MADDEN
                      (into mic)
                 Uhhh... excuse me...

      The place slowly comes to order.

                               STEVE MADDEN (CONT'D)
                 For those of you who don't know
                 me, my name is Steve Madden. I'm --

                               ONE BROKER
                 We know who you are!
                                                          67.
 The Wolf of Wall Street    Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

Steve clears his throat, looks over at Jordan -- he's
terrified. Jordan motions for him to calm down.

                          STEVE MADDEN
           I uh, I'd like to start by telling
           you about my background in the
           shoe industry.

                         ANOTHER BROKER
           Nice fucking hat!

                         STEVE MADDEN
           I uh... first started working in
           the shoe industry, in a shoe
           store. When I was sixteen, my
           friends were out chasing girls,
           but I was learning about women's
           shoes.

           KALIL                        PETER DEBLASIO

Move the mike closer.             We can't fucking hear you!

He moves the mic; feedback SCREECHES through the bullpen.

                         STEVE MADDEN (CONT'D)
           Sorry... Anyway, my first job
           was at a shoe store like I said
           where I worked in the stockroom.
           You know, I can honestly say I've
           been a lover of women's shoes
           since I was twelve--

                            BROKER #4
           Freak!

                         STEVE MADDEN
           No. Heh-heh. Not like that.
           I mean somehow I became fascinated
           with the endless design
           possibilities for women's shoes--


          BROKER #5                        BROKER #6
Queer!                            Get a fucking life!

Boos, hisses. Steve looks at Jordan, who motions for him
to speed up. He grabs a shoe from one of the boxes.

                            STEVE MADDEN (CONT'D)
           This shoe --    the Mary Lou -- is
           the one that    really put me on the
           map. It's a     black patent leather
           variation of    the Mary Jane, but--

SPLAT! A half-eaten grapefruit lands at Steve's feet.
In a flash, Jordan rushes over, grabs the mic--
                                                           68.
 The Wolf of Wall Street    Buff Revised Pages    3/5/13

                         JORDAN
           All right, let's hear it for Steve
           Madden and the wonderful Mary Lou!

Huge applause, with stomping feet; howling, etc.

                         JORDAN (CONT'D)
           Okay, now that you got that out
           of your system, I want you to know
           why Steve is so completely off the
           fucking wall... It's because this
           man is a creative genius. Steve's
           power, his gift -- is that he
           creates trends. Artists like
           Steve come along once a century!
           Elvis! Andy Warhol!    Giorgio
           Armani! Who knows how high this
           stock could go? The 20s? The
           50s? The 80s?

Applause; war whoops.      Jordan motions for quiet.

                         JORDAN (CONT'D)
           I want everybody to look down.
           See that little black box in front
           of you? It's called a telephone.
           Now I'm gonna let you in on a
           little secret about this
           telephone -- it won't dial itself!
           That's right -- until you take
           some action, it's nothing more
           than a worthless hunk of plastic,
           like a loaded M16 without a
           trained Marine to pull the
           trigger. And in the case of the
           telephone, it's the action of you,
           a highly trained Strattonite, a
           killer who will not take no for an
           answer!   A person who will not
           hang up the phone until his client
           either buys or fucking dies!

The Brokers go crazy.      Jordan looks around.

                         JORDAN (CONT'D)
           I don't care if you graduated from
           Harvard or Bumfuck University or
           never got past fourth fucking
           grade! That phone is the great
           equalizer!
                (pause; looks around)
           There is no nobility in poverty.
           I've been rich, and I've been poor
           and I choose rich every time.

                         JORDAN (CONT'D)
           At least as a rich man, when I
           have to face my problems, I show
           up in the back of a limo wearing a
           $2000 suit and $40,000 gold watch!

Jordan takes off his GOLD WATCH, flings it to the Crowd.
Brokers go nuts, fighting over it like a home-run ball.

                         JORDAN (CONT'D)
           And if anyone here thinks I'm
           crazy, get the fuck out and get a
           job at McDonald's, because that's
           where you fucking belong! But
           before you depart this room full
           of winners, I want you to take a
           good look at the person next to
           you, because one day in the not-so-
           distant future, you'll be sitting
           at a red light in your beat-up old
           Pinto, and that person's gonna
           pull up in a brand new Porsche,
           with their gorgeous young wife at
           their side. And who will you be
           next to? Some ugly beast with
           three days of razor-stubble in a
           sleeveless moo-moo, crammed in
           next to you with a carload of
           groceries from the fucking Price
           Club!

He scans the Brokers; they're on the edge of their seats.

                         JORDAN (CONT'D)
           So you listen to me and listen
           carefully. Are you behind on your
           credit card bills? Good. Pick up
           the phone and start dialing. Is
           your landlord threatening to evict
           you? Good. Pick up the phone and
           start dialing. Does your
           girlfriend think you're a fucking
           loser? Pick up the phone and
           start fucking dialing! I want
           you to deal with your problems by
           becoming rich! I want you to go
           out and spend money! Leverage
           yourself, back yourself into a
           corner, let the consequences of
           failure become so fucking
           unthinkable that you'll have no
           choice but to do whatever it takes
           to win!

The Brokers go absolutely APESHIT.

                  this without help. I'd leaked the
                  word on Wall Street that Stratton
                  was a buyer up until twenty. So
                  not only were we pushing Madden,

                 shares back at the top of the

                 up as high as I fucking wanted.

134   INT. JORDAN'S OFFICE - DAY    (FEB `95)                         134

      Donnie pours champagne nearby, oblivious to Jordan, who
      sits at his desk, speaking directly to camera:

                               JORDAN
                 Of the two million shares being
                 offered for sale, a million
                 belonged to me, held in phony
                 accounts by my ratholes. Once the
                 price hit the high teens, I--

      Jordan abruptly stops.     A beat, then:

                               JORDAN (CONT'D)
                 Like I said before, who gives a
                 shit? As always, the point is
                 this--

      BACK TO SCENE -- Donnie hands Jordan a glass of Dom.

      They toast, then each pop ludes, which they wash down
      with champagne. A quick knock; Janet pops her head in.

                                 JORDAN

      Curious, Jordan leans over, hits the speaker phone:

                    Jordan, hey. Listen, I got a
                    subpoena. The FBI wants a copy
                    of your wedding video.

       FBI Agent Patrick Denham takes target practice.

                    Name's Denham, he's an agent in

       The East Harlem institution. Jordan sits across a table
       over pasta with private investigator BO DIETL, 40s.

                                  JORDAN
                    But my goddamn wedding video?

                                  BO DIETL
                    Got your whole inner circle in one
                    place, faces and names. He's
                    hoping it rattles you, or maybe
                    your wife, so that she starts
                    nagging you to turn witness.

                                  JORDAN
                         (that's laughable)
                    What? He wants me to rat on
                    myself?

                  Good news is I made some calls,
                  DEA, Justice? No one but him even
                  knows who you are.

                                JORDAN
                  Can you bug him or something, tap
                  his phone?

                                BO DIETL
                  Jordan, relax. First off, you
                  don't fuck with these guys, not
                  that way. Secondly, I got a P.I.
                  license, you know?

                                JORDAN
                  Maybe I should call him, see what
                  he wants.

                                BO DIETL
                  No! Anybody does that should be
                  your lawyer. What you do is eat
                  your dinner, drink your drink, and
                  forget about it. Cuz as far as I
                  hear he doesn't have shit.

       Jordan nods, wheels turning, pretending to do as told.

       HUGHES, beside him, both G-man stoic in impenetrably dark      *
       glasses --

                                JORDAN (O.S.)
                  Patrick? Hey! C'mon aboard!

       They look up. On the yacht Naomi, Jordan stands waving,
       drinking wine with two Blue Chip HOOKERS in bikinis.

                                JORDAN (CONT'D)
                  Plank's right down there.

       Denham shares a look with his cohort: it's almost a joke,
       this display of wealth before a federal agent. Moments
       later, they step aboard.

                                AGENT DENHAM
                  Mr. Belfort, I'm Agent Denham.
                  This is Agent Hughes.

           um...Heidi. Girls, Patrick and...?

                         AGENT DENHAM
           Agents Denham and Hughes. Your
           message said you wanted to speak
           privately.

                         JORDAN
           It did. I do.
                (off Denham's stare)
           Oh, they're just friends.
                (to the girls)
           Give us a minute, okay?

The Hookers head below deck. Jordan shoots Denham a wink--
check out that ass!

                         JORDAN (CONT'D)
           Can I get a glass? Got wine open
           or any kinda booze. Shrimp and
           lobster're over there if you're
           hungry.

                         AGENT DENHAM
           Bureau forbids us from drinking at
           sea.

Jordan surprised: the guy has a sense of humor.

                         JORDAN
           I have something for you, I just
           gotta find it. Have a seat, will
           ya? Ever been on one of these
           before?

As Jordan rifles through some papers, Denham's eyes scan
the deck, casually cataloguing everything.

                         AGENT DENHAM
           A boat? Learned to sail when I was
           six.

                         JORDAN
           I mean, one like this. Just had
           her extended to put a chopper on
           the back.

Jordan points out the Bell-Jet helicopter.

                         AGENT DENHAM
           Never been on a boat with a second
           mode of transportation on top of
           it.

Jordan finds the file he's been looking for, offers it.

                         AGENT DENHAM (CONT'D)
                (before he'll accept)
           What is this?

                         JORDAN
           Names and addresses of every guest
           at my wedding. Friends, clients. I
           even threw in the seating chart.
           Heard that's why you wanted the
           video, figured this'd expedite
           whatever it is you're doing.
                (Denham looks: it's
                 indeed a guest list
                 from the wedding)
           I wanted to show you I've got
           nothing to hide. I know you're
           investigating Stratton but for the
           life of me I can't figure out why.
           Sure, my company is unorthodox;
           what brokerage isn't? Maybe we're
           a little louder than most but we
           don't do anything illegal. Talk to
           the SEC, they'll tell you, they
           checked us out up and down.

                         AGENT DENHAM
           The SEC's actually a civil
           regulatory agency. We pursue
           criminal activity.

                         JORDAN
           That's what I'm saying. You guys
           take on real crime. Which is why
           I'm so curious: what do you think
           we did?

The reason Jordan asked him here, Denham realizes.

                         AGENT DENHAM
           I can't discuss ongoing
           investigations.

                           JORDAN
           I understand.

                         AGENT DENHAM
           Though, to be frank, this case
           kinda got dumped on my desk. Some
           higher-up felt your shop needed
           looking into after all that press,
           fell on me to do the looking.

                         JORDAN
           You know who you should be looking
           at? Goldman, Lehman Brothers,
           Merrill.

           What those guys're up to with
           collateralized debt obligations?
           This internet stock bullshit?
           C'mon. If you want, I'll walk you
           through exactly --

                         AGENT DENHAM
           -- that'd be great. And if there's
           anything you can give me just to
           close out your file, get it off my
           desk--

                         JORDAN

           criminals --

                         AGENT DENHAM
           -- then we could both profit from
           this little sit-down.

Jordan sizes him up: what did Denham mean by "profit"?

                         JORDAN
           You sure you don't want anything
           to drink? Water for your pal?
                (Denham demurs)
           Rumor is your started out in
           finance. Even got your broker's
           license before you joined the
           bureau.

                         AGENT DENHAM
           Who told you that?

                          JORDAN
                (searches his memory)
           Jeez, who was it...?
                (comes up short)
           Ever regret it? Giving up the
           money-crazed, pin-striped life?
           Ever think where you'd be if you'd
           stuck with it?

                         AGENT DENHAM
           When I'm riding the subway home,
           sweating my balls off, in a suit
           I've worn three days, sure.

                         JORDAN
           Whattaya pull in working at the
           bureau, if you don't mind me
           asking. 50-60K a year?

                         AGENT DENHAM
           Just about. We get a free handgun
           out of it, though, that doesn't
           suck.

           S'crazy, the world we live in, the
           jobs with real value, the ones we
           should appreciate -- firefighters,
           teachers, FBI agents -- those are

           Way of the world.

                         JORDAN
           That's one thing I like about what
           I do, the opportunity to make that
           right. Take this kid we had
           interning last year. Didn't want
           to be a broker, wanted to be an
           environmental scientist or
           something, he had a student loan
           debts up to his eyeballs. Anyway,
           his mom gets sick, all they can
           afford is third-rate care. Some of
           us got together, made an
           investment on his behalf and --
           boom -- overnight everything
           changes, she's seeing the best
           doctors in the country. Sadly,
           didn't work out, she passed but
           still: having the power to do that
           makes all the other bullshit worth
           while.
                (as Denham considers
                  that)
           See, it's all about proper
           guidance, Pat. Knowing someone
           with the right relationships,
           who's discreet. I can change a
           life almost every day.

They measure each other.

                         AGENT DENHAM
           How much that intern make off your
           deal?

           North of half a million.

Denham summons Agent Hughes over. To Jordan:

                         AGENT DENHAM
           Can you say that again, what you
           told me?
                (Jordan declines with
                 a smile; to Agent
                 Hughes)
           I believe Mr. Belfort just tried
           to bribe a federal officer.

                         JORDAN
           What? I was making conversation.

                         AGENT DENHAM
           Sounds like that to me, Jordan.

                         JORDAN
           ...no, no, no...

                         AGENT DENHAM
           ...sounded like that...

                         JORDAN
           ...no, to constitute a bribe,
           don't I have to make an explicit
           offer of money for services? With
           an exact dollar figure attached?
           All I said was "north" of half a
           million. According to the U.S.
           Criminal Code, that dog won't
           hunt, Pat.
                (then)
           Heard you were a straight arrow.
           That you wouldn't bend the rules
           other agents might. He was right.

                         AGENT DENHAM
           You did a background check on me?

                         JORDAN
           Figured you were looking into me,
           was only fair. Plus you sail on a
           yacht fit for a Bond villain,
           sometimes you gotta act the part.

                         AGENT DENHAM
           This is why you invited me down to
           your yacht? With a couple hookers
           on it --

                         JORDAN
           -- those are friends --

                         AGENT DENHAM
           -- to get a sense of the guy who
           was coming after you?

Jordan puts his hands up: "you got me."

                         JORDAN
           Thanks for coming down. Now get
           off my boat.

                         AGENT DENHAM
           You know, most of the Wall Street
           jackasses I bust, they were born
           to the life.
                                                                79.

                 Their father was a douchebag
                 before them, and his father before
                 that. But you, you got this way
                 all on your own. Good for you,
                 Jordan.
                      (as he starts to go)
                 Thank you for having us. I'm
                 absolutely certain we'll see each
                 other again.
                      (before he does)
                 You know, this is about the nicest
                 boat I've ever been on. Just think
                 what a hero I'll be in the office
                 when the bureau seizes it.

      Jordan watches him go, temper flaring: he can't let
      Denham get the final word. He calls after them:

                               JORDAN
                 Hey, Denham! I'm gonna eat a claw
                 of lobster now as I get my cock
                 sucked by Heidi down below. You
                 have a super ride home on the
                 subway thinking about that!                          *

      As he watches them pull away, seething --

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                 He was a numbers guy, a follow-the-
                 fucking-money'er. He wasn't gonna
                 come at me through my guys,
                 looking for a weak link and a
                 quick kill. He was gonna come at
                 me like an accountant would, the
                 way Ness got Capone, through my
                 books. Which meant? It was ass-
                 covering time.


138   INT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY      (SUMMER `95)   138

      As Naomi looks on, 5 months pregnant, Jordan packs a
      suitcase.

                                 NAOMI
                 Switzerland?    What the fuck is in
                 Switzerland?

                                JORDAN
                 Swiss cheese, Naomi, what do you
                 fucking think?


139   INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY               *139
      (SUMMER `95)

      Jordan sits talking with Rugrat and Donnie.
                                                               80.
       The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 Rugrat set up a meeting with a
                 Swiss Banker he knew from law
                 school who could launder our
                 money, but it wasn't till noon
                 the next day.

      Jordan glances at his watch, washes down a few ludes.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 I knew if I timed my lude intake
                 right, I'd sleep through the
                 entire overnight flight.


140   INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - DAY (SUMMER `95)         140

      Jordan stands before the Bullpen talking to his Brokers.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 At four p.m. I popped a few ludes,
                 which started kicking in by the
                 time I finished our sales meeting.
                 This was the tingle phase.


141   INT. CANASTEL'S - NIGHT    (SUMMER `95)                        141

      Over dinner, a visibly high Jordan ravenously digs into
      his food as Donnie and four Blue Chip Hookers look on.

                               JORDAN   (V.O.)
                 By dinner I popped a few more on
                 top of some cocktails and an
                 valium or two. The slur phase.


142   INT. DANCE CLUB - NIGHT    (SUMMER `95)                        142

      On the crowded dance floor, Jordan gets knocked around
      like a marionette, saliva strung from his mouth.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 By eight thirty I'd done a few
                 more and pretty much lost my motor
                 skills. This was the drool phase.


143   INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT (SUMMER `95)                          143

      Jordan is barely conscious as a Hooker rides him.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 And by ten I didn't know who or
                 what I was doing -- the amnesia
                 phase. We boarded the plane just
                 before midnight.
                                                               81.

144   INT. ZURICH AIRLINES - FIRST CLASS - NIGHT (SUMMER `95)        *144

      Jordan boards, slurring, drooling, completely wasted.

                               JORDAN
                      (to a Stewardess)
                 Sweetheart! Look at you!

      And as he hugs her, then stumbles toward his seat...


145   INT. ZURICH AIRLINES - FIRST CLASS - DAY (SUMMER `95)          *145

      Quiet; morning sunlight bleeds through the window.
      Jordan's eyes flicker open. He yawns, looks around,
      tries to get up; he can't move. He looks down, sees
      six seat belts restraining his arms and legs. Jordan
      looks over at Donnie, mouth agape, asleep next to him.

                                JORDAN
                 Donnie.   Donnie, wake up.

                                 DONNIE
                 Nuuhh?

                               JORDAN
                 Untie me, shitbag. You think this
                 is funny?

                               DONNIE
                 I didn't tie you, the captain did.
                 He almost tasered you.

                                 JORDAN
                 Why?


146   FLASHBACK --                                                   146

      As PASSENGERS scream, Jordan wildly humps a STEWARDESS,
      the CAPTAIN struggling to restrain him.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 This was fucking great. I hadn't
                 laundered a dime yet and already
                 I was under arrest.


147   INT. ZURICH AIRLINES - FIRST CLASS - DAY (SUMMER `95)          *147

      A pensive Jordan sits, mind racing.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 Worse yet was the plastic baggie
                 of ludes that Donnie'd stuffed up
                 his ass.
                                                                82.
        The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

       Jordan trades looks with Donnie, who shifts
       uncomfortably.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                  But before he could even get a
                  hemorrhoid--

       Jordan sits with two CUSTOMS OFFICERS.                         *

                  was lucky for me, since so far I'd                  *
                  been able to keep Agent Fuckface                    *
                  unaware of the trip.                                *

       Another CUSTOMS OFFICER enters, whispers something to the      *
       others. They shake Jordan's hand and he leaves.                *


148    EXT. GENEVA - SHOPPING DISTRICT - DAY (SUMMER `95)             148

       A limo pulls up at an office building.      Jordan emerges
       with Rugrat and Donnie.                                        *


149    INT. BANQUE REAL DE GENEVE - LOBBY - DAY (SUMMER `95)          149

       JEAN-JACQUES SAUREL greets them. 30s, suave. The lobby is
       ultra-modernist.

                                SAUREL
                  Jordan Belfort! At last!
                  Nicholas has told me so much.

                  Nice to make your acquaintance.
                  This is some lobby you got.

                                SAUREL
                  Ah, yes. We gave our designer an
                  unlimited budget and he exceeded
                  it. Come! You must tell me all
                  about your adventure with the
                  stewardess over coffee!

       They disappear upstairs.

151   INT. BANQUE REAL DE GENEVE - SAUREL'S OFFICE - DAY               151

      Jordan, Rugrat and Donnie drink coffee with Saurel and
      one other SWISS BANKER. It's an impressive office, with          *
      an enormous fish tank.

                               DONNIE
                 We have a joke in America.
                 "Heaven is a place where the
                 police are Brits, the chefs are
                 Italian, the car mechanics are
                 German, the prostitutes are French
                 and the bankers are Swiss." I
                 never got it `til now -- look at
                 those fucking fish! Come here,
                 little guy...

                               SAUREL
                 Yes, we have the same joke here.
                 Only sometimes the English are
                 chauffeurs and the chefs are
                 French. The Germans, alas, are
                 always mechanics; no one wants to
                 grant them more authority than
                 that.

      Polite laughter. Jordan, not as impressed by the fish,
      cuts straight to the point:


                               JORDAN
                 I'm curious about your bank
                 secrecy laws.

                               SAUREL
                 Excusez-moi, Jordan, Swiss custom
                 requires ten minutes of idle chit-
                 chat before business can be
                 discussed.
                      (a smile)
                 Of course, let's get "down to it."
                 What would you like to know?

                                JORDAN
                 Under what circumstances would you
                 be obligated to cooperate with an
                 FBI or U.S. Justice Department
                 investigation?

           Switzerland in the coming months.

           Want me to see if tanks are
           rolling down the Rue de la Croix?

More chuckles.   Through Jordan's forced smile:

                         JORDAN (V.O.)
           What I'm asking, you Swiss dick,
           is are you going to fuck me over.

                         SAUREL (V.O.)
           I understand perfectly, you
           American shitheel.

Saurel smiles.

                         SAUREL
           The only way the Banque Real de
           Geneve would cooperate with a
           foreign legal body is if the crime
           being pursued also happened to be
           a crime in Switzerland. But there
           are very few Swiss laws pertaining
           to your "rumored" improprieties.
           Which is why Mr. Azoff's joke is
           most appropriate: from a financial
           standpoint you are now in heaven,

           Justice Department or FBI or SEC
           or IRS sent us a subpoena, it
           would become papier-toillette. We
           would wipe our ass with it.

           Unless it was an investigation
           into stock fraud -- which is a
           crime in Switzerland. Then you'd
           have to cooperate.

                (now he's impressed)
           Yes, we would. Assuming the
           account is under your name.
           However, if it were in the name of
           a nominee of yours...

They take each other in.

                 Was that yodeling I just heard or
                 did you just say what I thought
                 you said?

                 He was telling me to use a
                 rathole. Problem was: sneaking a
                 U.S. rathole into Switzerland was
                 a chance I couldn't take. What I
                 needed was somebody with a
                 European passport.

      Amid towering trees and horse trails, a noticeably
      twitchy Jordan walks arm-in-arm with Aunt Emma.

                               AUNT EMMA
                 So tell me about this plan of
                 yours.

                               JORDAN
                 I'd like us to go to Switzerland
                 tomorrow so you can open an
                 account. I'll fund it, and I'll
                 pay you really well for your
                 trouble.

           Next month maybe you can fly to
           New York and we can start moving
           the cash.

                         AUNT EMMA
           Moving the cash.
                (smiles)
           I feel like a character in an
           Ian Fleming novel. It's all quite
           racy, isn't it?

           It is, and it's illegal too. Of
           course if you ever got in trouble,
           I'd come forward in two seconds,
           say I duped you, but even still.

                         AUNT EMMA
           Risk is what keeps us young, isn't
           it darling?

                          JORDAN
           I like that attitude. Promise me                      *
           you'll spend at least ten thousand
           pounds per month out of the
           account, okay?

                         AUNT EMMA
                (chuckles)
           I wouldn't even know how. I
           really do have everything I need.

                         JORDAN
           But I bet you don't have
           everything you want. How about a
           bigger apartment so your grandkids
           can sleep over?

Aunt Emma notices that Jordan is sweating, fidgety.       He's
jonesing.

                           AUNT EMMA
           Shall we sit?

                         JORDAN
           Sure, that'd be great.

They sit on a nearby bench.     After a while:

                         AUNT EMMA
           Sometimes I wonder if you let
           money get the best of you, dear.

           addicted to than sex.

                         JORDAN
                (chuckles; then)
           Why did I just tell you that?                         *

           Because I'm very easy to talk to.

Jordan looks at her.       A few beats, then:

                         JORDAN
           As a matter of fact you are. My                       *

                         AUNT EMMA

Jordan looks at her and smiles:

                         JORDAN (V.O.)
           Is she fucking hitting on me?

                         JORDAN
           I agree. I put it on myself. It's                     *
           hard to control the anxiety, you                      *

                         AUNT EMMA
           To release the tension.

                         JORDAN (V.O.)
           She is hitting on me! Holy shit!

Jordan leans in closer, casually slips an arm around her.
                                                                88.

                  When I got home, I realized there
                  was no way Aunt Emma could smuggle
                  that much cash by herself. I
                  racked my brain for another person
                  with a foreign passport.

       The bed's covered with bundles of cash. Every thrust of
       Jordan's, another bundle plummets to the floor -- thunk.

           Can you just do one trip for him?

Brad stews.   It's asking a lot.

        Wheeling a small carry-on suitcase, Aunt Emma smiles at a
        CUSTOMS AGENT, who waves her through.

                                 JORDAN (V.O.)
                   Which in the big picture was a

160aA   On another day, Chantalle and her family (PARENTS,               160aA
        BROTHER, his WIFE) pass through Customs, "on vacation."

                                 JORDAN (V.O.)
                   -- because the following month,
                   over the course of six round-
                   trips, Chantalle and her family
                   smuggled in over twenty million
                   without even a hiccup.

        With a cash-filled suitcase on the table, Chantalle
        remembers a last fold of cash hidden inside her skirt's
        lining. She laughs with Saurel.

170D   EXT. STRIP MALL - PARKING LOT - LONG ISLAND - DAY                170D
       (LATE SUMMER `95)

       Brad waits by his Range Rover as Donnie's Rolls careens
       into the lot. He emerges, briefcase in hand.

                                    DONNIE
                  Fu Manchu!      Kung fu!

       Donnie starts doing spastic karate moves. Is he high?
       Sure looks like it. Brad looks pissed, and Donnie starts
       laughing. Actually he's dead sober.

                                DONNIE (CONT'D)
                  I'm just fucking with you, man.
                  Jesus, the look on your face.
                       (Brad isn't laughing)
                  Hey, sorry if I got outta line the
                  other day, I was just, that was
                  the drugs talking...

                                BRAD
                  S'cool, just... gimme the case.

                                DONNIE
                       (he doesn't)
                  You know, I always kinda regretted
                  you didn't come to work with us at
                  Stratton. It'd be so cool having
                  you around, man.

                                BRAD
                       (growing impatient)
                  Yeah, well...

                                DONNIE
                  You'd be one of us, we'd go out-
                  partying together, you wouldn't
                  have to dress like a mall rat
                  guinea prison bitch all the time.

       Donnie grins, obviously still smarting from Brad's slap.
       Brad just wants to take the money and be done.

                                BRAD
                  Give me the money.

       A DISTANCE AWAY, a COP in a patrol car notices Brad
       gesturing to Donnie for his briefcase. He nudges his
       partner: check this out.

                                DONNIE
                  Can I come over and help tape this
                  to your wife? "Eez so focking
                  steeky! Take eet off, Bra-hod!"

       Brad composes himself, lest he kill the guy.
                                                                93.

                  I'm gonna give you a pass.

                                  DONNIE

                                  BRAD
                  Yes.    Just gimme the money.

                                DONNIE
                  You're gonna give me a pass?
                  Okay...
                       (offers the case)
                  Why don't you stick your pass up
                  your Slavic cunt's pussy.

       That does it. Brad attacks. Donnie throws the case at
       him, which opens on impact, money spilling out. Brad
       instinctively tries to contain it... and that's when the
       POLICE SIRENS start. Here comes the patrol car.

                                  BRAD
                  Shit!

       Donnie bolts. With no time to get to his car, Brad takes
       off on foot, bleeding briefcase in hand, toward a video
       store where he stashes his .38 in the return box.

                                 POLICE
                  Freeze!   Don't move!

       Brad drops to his knees, briefcase at his feet. From a
       distance, Donnie peers around a corner to watch him get
       arrested, knowing he fucked this up.

                 The Lemmon 714 was the Holy Grail

                 as anything available today. For
                 a Quaalude addict, it was like
                 finding a 1952 Chateau Margaux.

       Jordan can't respond. Phone still to his ear, his
       eyelids droop. Drool spills from his slackened jaw.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                  After fifteen years in storage,
                  the Lemmons had developed a
                  delayed fuse.

       JORDAN'S POV -- is hazy as he stares at his own
       reflection in the pay phone.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                  It took 90 minutes for the little
                  fuckers to kick in, but once they
                  did -- pow! I had skipped the
                  tingle phase and went straight to
                  the drool phase.

       JORDAN'S POV -- the phone gets further and further away.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                  Actually I'd discovered a new
                  phase: the cerebral palsy phase.

       BAMMM!! Jordan hits the floor with a thud, crashed out
       on his back. From the dangling phone, we hear:

                                BO DIETL (O.S.)
                       (over phone)
                  Jordan! Jordan! Do not get behind
                  the wheel! Just tell me where
                  you're at, I'll send Rocco!

       Jordan lolls his head toward the phone, tries to reach
       for it; he can't. He lays there for a while, then:

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                  C'mon, stand up!

       He rolls onto all fours, lifts a hand, topples over.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                  Okay, walking is off the list of
                  options. All right, what else is
                  there?
                       (a brainstorm)
                  I can crawl, like Skylar!

       Slowly, Jordan begins crawling like an infant to the top
       of the staircase.

189   EXT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT (LATE SUMMER `95)                           189

      The Lamborghini is parked at the bottom, twenty steps
      down. He starts to crawl down the stairs, stops. Tries
      again. Can't figure out how to do it.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                 Fuck!   The kid makes it look so
                 easy!

      An icy wind blows through his T-shirt.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 Think, you motherfucker, think!
                      (a few beats; then)
                 Wait, I've got it!

      Jordan slowly curls himself into a ball.

                                   JORDAN (V.O.)
                 I can roll!

      Forcing himself over the edge, Jordan begins to descend
      the steps, one at a time. Thump. Thump. Then faster.
      Thump- Thump-Thump. Faster still. He loses control,
      takes all the steps at once. Thump-Thump-Thump-Thump-
      Thump-Thump. He lands with a crash on the asphalt,
      drags himself up and into the Lamborghini.

      Ignition on, Jordan sits hunched over, chin resting on
      the steering wheel. Just then, the car phone RINGS.
      With great effort, he pushes the speaker phone button:

                 with some Swiss guy!

                 They say God protects drunks and

Fuck it. Jordan releases Donnie. Donnie crawls into the            *
dining room and starts shoving ham into his mouth in an            *
effort to sober up. Just then, we HEAR a horrible                  *
GAGGING sound. Donnie holds his throat as he falls                 *
backward choking, taking out the entire glass kitchen
table with a tremendous CRASH! Naomi rushes back in.               *

           Omigod, he's choking!     Jordan, do
           something!!

Just then, WE HEAR the triumphant Popeye FANFARE --
Jordan looks to the TV, where POPEYE pours a can of
spinach down his gullet. Instantly, his chest and arm
muscles swell to five times their size.

Jordan goes to get his coke. He snarfs up two fat
spoonfuls and -- like that -- his chest swells and he
takes a deep breath and he dashes back to the rescue...

Jordan rushes back to Donnie, who is now blue.

                         NAOMI (CONT'D)
           He's not breathing!

Jordan places his fingers over Donnie's artery.         Nothing.

                          NAOMI (CONT'D)
           Save him!

Jordan kneels, starts furiously pumping Donnie's chest,
breathing air into his lungs in rhythmic bursts.

                         JORDAN (V.O.)
           This stupid sonovabitch! All
           Donnie ever did was fuck me up and
           now I had to save his life `cause
           I took a CPR class when the baby
           was learning to swim. Just for
           the record, I want it noted: not
           for a second did I even think
           about letting him choke to death,
           even though it would've saved me
           an awful lot of headaches.

Donnie still isn't breathing. Jordan flips him over,
tries the Heimlich -- we hear a CRUNCH as he breaks
Donnie's ribs. He flips him back over, but he's almost
completely blue.
                                                                 103.

                  Don't let him die! He has
                  children!

       One last try. Jordan takes a massive breath, blowing as
       hard as he can into Donnie's lungs. Donnie's stomach
       distends like a balloon, then suddenly a chunk of ham
       projects from his mouth and into Jordan's face. Donnie
       coughs, vomiting. And as he starts breathing again,
       Jordan exits and passes out on the living room couch.            *

                  That's what all lucky people say.
                  It's time, Jordan. Let me make a
                  deal with SEC. Before your luck
                  runs out.

       Skylar waves from the pony and Jordan waves back.

                                JORDAN
                  What kind of terms?

                                MANNY RISKIN
                  You plead guilty to a handful of
                  securities violations -- stock
                  manipulation, high pressure sales
                  tactics, ticky-tack shit like
                  that. You pay a few million
                  dollars in fines and in exchange
                  the SEC fucks off for all time.

                                  JORDAN
                  And Stratton?    What happens there?

                  You'd have to walk away. Let
                  Donnie take over.
                       (that one hurts)
                  Now the FBI's a different animal.
                  They can still pursue you for
                  criminal wrongdoing. But with you
                  on the sidelines, my guess is your
                  best friend Agent Denham'll be
                  left standing around with his dick
                  in his hand.

       Jordan digests that.

                                MAX
                  You beat them, Jordan. You won.
                  Sail into the sunset with your
                  wife and kids while you can.

                                MANNY RISKIN
                  God knows you'll never have to
                  work again.

       THE ROAR OF A CROWD...

202E   INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - DAY                      202E
       (SPRING `96)

       The troops ROAR as Jordan takes center stage.

                                JORDAN
                  I'm sure many of you have been
                  hearing rumors lately, about me,
                  about the future of this firm, and
                  that's what I'd like to talk to
                  you about today.
                       (a few beats, then)
                  Five years ago when I started
                  Stratton with Donnie Azoff, I knew
                  the day would eventually come when
                  I'd be moving on. It's truly with
                  a heavy heart that I tell you that
                  day is here.

       The place erupts in a chorus of "No!", "Don't go!", etc.
       Jordan raises his hand for quiet.

                                JORDAN (CONT'D)
                  Thank you for that and for your
                  years of incredible loyalty and
                  admiration.
                                                        106.
The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13
                         JORDAN (CONT'D)
           The point is though, that under
           Donnie's leadership, along with
           Robbie Feinberg and Nicky Koskoff
           moving into key management
           positions, this place is gonna be
           better than ever!

A smattering of applause. Jordan notices a few Brokers
gravely shaking their heads.

                         JORDAN (CONT'D)
           And the fact that I'm gone won't
           stop me from giving Donnie advice,
           not that he needs any--

                         DONNIE
                (jumping in)
           Why would anyone in their right
           mind not follow JB's advice?

Donnie looks petrified; he's used to being an offensive
tackle, not the quarterback.

                         JORDAN
           Before I go, there's something I
           want to remind you all, and that's
           this -- Stratton Oakmont is bigger
           than any one person, even me.
           Especially me. You guys are
           Stratton, each and every one of
           you, and that is why it's sure to
           remain the best brokerage firm in
           the fucking world!

Thunderous applause spreads through the boardroom, all
300 Brokers on their feet. WE PUSH IN on Jordan.

                         JORDAN (CONT'D)
           See, the very idea of Stratton is
           that when you come here and step
           into this bullpen for the first
           time, you start your life anew.
           You have a place here and no one
           can take that away from you!
           Stratton Oakmont is America! Give
           me your tired and poor! The very
           moment you walk through that door
           and pledge your loyalty to this
           firm, you become part of a family,
           you become a Strattonite! It
           doesn't matter who you are, it
           doesn't matter where you're from!
           Whether your family came over on
           the Mayflower or on a fucking
           inner tube from Haiti!
                                                          107.
The Wolf of Wall Street    Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

More applause. Jordan scans the young faces -- they
worship him. In the crowd he finds KIMMIE BELZER, 30s.

                          JORDAN (CONT'D)
           Everybody here knows Kimmie
           Belzer, right?

Hoots and hollers...      He raises his hand for quiet.

                         JORDAN (CONT'D)
           In case any of you weren't aware
           of it, Kimmie was one of
           Stratton's first brokers, one of
           the original twenty. Now when
           most of you met Kimmie, you met
           her the way she is today -- a
           beautiful woman who drives a brand
           new Mercedes, a woman who lives in
           the finest condo complex on Long
           Island. A woman who wears $3000
           Armani suits, who spends her
           winters in the Bahamas and her
           summers in the Hamptons!

Wild applause.

                         JORDAN (CONT'D)
           But that's not the Kimmie I met.
           The Kimmie I met was broke, a
           single mom on the balls of her
           ass. Three months behind on her
           rent with an eight year old son!
           She came to me for a job and when
           I hired her she asked for a $5000
           dollar advance so she could pay
           his tuition. And what did I do,
           Kimmie?

                         KIMMIE
           You wrote me a check for $25,000!

                         JORDAN
           Because I believed in you, like
           I believe in each and every one
           of you!

                         KIMMIE
           I love you, Jordan!

As the Brokers go berserk, Jordan stands basking in the
adoration. He looks at Donnie, turns back to the Crowd,
looks out at the faces. A change has come over him.
He stands there, thinking. An eternity, then:
                                                                108.
        The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

                                 JORDAN
                   You know for years I've been
                   telling you guys not to take no
                   for an answer, to keep pushing,
                   to not hang up the phone till you
                   get what you want. This deal I'm
                   about to sign, barring me from the
                   securities industry, barring me
                   from Stratton, my home... What the
                   fuck is that? I'll tell you what
                   it is, it's me being a hypocrite.
                   It's me taking no for an answer,
                   it's them selling me, not the
                   other way around! Fuck it, I'm
                   not leaving!

        Jordan smiles, thrusts his hands in the air --

                                 JORDAN (CONT'D)
                   THE SHOW GOES ON!!

        The place goes absolutely INSANE. And as Donnie and Max
        trade looks, TECHNO MUSIC BLASTS taking us to...

Jordan thinks, snorts a line to think better.

                         JORDAN (V.O.)
           Even though I owned 85% of Steve-
           Cocksucker-Madden-fucking-Shoes,
           the shares were in his fucking
           name. Motherfucker knew I was in
           trouble with the Feds and was
           trying to take advantage.

He gets back on the phone with Rugrat.

                  Thanks but where does this leave
                  us in regard to her account? It
                  goes into probate or what?

                                SAUREL
                  Not to worry, Jordan. Your aunt,
                  before she died, signed a document
                  naming you as her successor.

                                 JORDAN

                  Well. Not as of yet.

       And as they continue talking, Jordan pulls out a nautical
       map of the Italian coastline:

211   INT. ITALIAN NAVAL DESTROYER - BELOW DECK - NIGHT                   *211
      (SUMMER `96)

      Off to the side, Jordan watches as Naomi, their Friends,
      and the yacht's Crew Members dance to blaring techno
      music. A small group of Italian SAILORS cheer them on.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 The nice thing about getting
                 rescued by Italians is that the
                 first thing they do is feed you
                 and make you drink red wine.
                 Then they make you dance.

      Jordan watches as the dancing continues, then casually
      glances out a porthole, where WE SEE the distant lights
      of a PLANE making its way across the night sky. After a
      few beats, the plane EXPLODES, a tiny flash of light.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 Did you see that? That was the
                 plane I sent for to come get us.
                 I shit you not, it exploded when
                 a seagull flew into the engine,
                 three people killed. You want a
                 sign from God, well after all this
                 I finally got the message. I had
                 to make some fucking changes.

                                                              FADE OUT.

       Shot on 90's-era video, an ad intended for late-night
       local tv. The defining idea here is that while the
       commercial may be amateurish, Jordan isn't; he's an
       excellent salesman even if the ad is cut-rate.

                    The first action you have to take
                    is to DECIDE to be wealthy. When

                    DECISION not to just survive but
                    to THRIVE. I started my own stock

                    SYSTEM OF SELLING that within a

                  Rugrat, he'd been busted down in
                  Miami, and guess who the fuck
                  with?


219    EXT. MIAMI RESTAURANT - NIGHT (SEP `98)                        219

       Jean-Jacques Saurel is handcuffed by Feds as Rugrat looks
       on crying, handcuffed nearby.

                  What were the odds? There had to
                  be ten thousand Swiss bankers in
                  Geneva and I choose the one dumb
                  enough to get himself arrested on
                  U.S. soil.

                  Even more ironic was he'd gotten
                  himself indicted on charges that
                  had nothing to fucking do with me.


221    EXT. MIAMI MANSION - NIGHT     (SEP `98)                       221

       ROCKY AOKI, Japanese, 50s, is led out in handcuffs by a
       MAN in an FBI windbreaker.

                  Something about laundering drug
                  money through offshore boat racing
                  and a guy named Rocky Aoki, the
                  founder of Benihana.

       A smiling Rocky Aoki looks on as a HIBACHI CHEF expertly
       dices shrimp on a sizzling grill.

                                 JORDAN (V.O.)
                  Beni-fucking-hana! Why would God
                  be so cruel as to choose a chain
                  of fucking Hibachi Restaurants to
                  bring me down?


222    INT. SAUREL'S BEDROOM - DAY (OCT `95)                          222

       Saurel lays on the bed, smoking.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                  Long story short was Saurel ratted
                  me out, but not before he ratted
                  out Chantalle, who it turns out
                  he'd been fucking every time she
                  went to Switzerland!

       Chantalle emerges from the bathroom naked.     Laughing, she
       runs and jumps in bed with Saurel.

       Jordan exits the building. He's fucked and he knows it.
       He sees beautiful Naomi waiting for him beside a
       limosine; life isn't totally hopeless. He approaches.

                                JORDAN
                  Nay, thank God. I'm so glad
                  you're here.

       They embrace. He can't see her expression: she'd rather
       be anywhere else.

226   EXT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - POOL AREA - DAY         (SEP `98)          226

      ON SKYLAR AND PARKER, playing with a NANNY and Rocky the
      dog. Jordan watches them, sitting by his pool, drinking
      an O'Douls, weighing his options.

      Donnie pops into the yard, in "Uncle Donnie" mode.

                               DONNIE
                 Hey, everybody! How're the
                 happiest people in Long Island?
                 Hi, Rocky!!
                      (joining Jordan)
                 Hate that fucking dog.

                               JORDAN
                 Tell me about it. It's getting
                 old, starting to shit inside the
                 house again.

      Jordan offers Donnie an O'Douls; Donnie declines.

                               DONNIE
                 How you doing, brother?     How was
                 the food in jail?

                               JORDAN
                 Lobster Newburg sucked.     They gave
                 me some jewelry though.

      He shows off the electronic bracelet around his ankle.

                                DONNIE
                 Wonder if they got one in my size.
                 Fuckin' Rugrat, that wig-wearin'
                 hump. Tell you one thing: I'm
                 never eating at Benihana's again.
                 Where's Naomi?

                                 JORDAN
                 Inside.    Pissed.

      Donnie sees Naomi in a window.      He waves but she barely
      registers him.

                               DONNIE
                 What's up her ass?

                               JORDAN
                 Had to mortgage the home to make
                 bail. Probably gonna hafta sell
                 it to pay my lawyers. If we fight
                 this thing.

      Donnie weighs that.
                                                               124.

                                DONNIE
                  The Feds say anything about coming
                  after the rest of us?

       Jordan thinks, then shakes his head no.

                                DONNIE (CONT'D)
                  You know, we're all behind you.
                  Everyone at the office.
                       (he removes an
                        envelope, hands it
                        to Jordan)
                  We bought back your mortgage. All
                  the founding partners threw in a
                  million apiece. Figured none of
                  us would have it if it weren't for
                  you.

       Jordan's profoundly touched. Donnie squeezes his
       shoulder. A real moment of friendship.

                                DONNIE (CONT'D)
                  You gotta fight this thing, baby.

       Jordan nods.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                  Like I said, loyalty meant a lot
                  to me. Without your friends and
                  family standing behind you, you're
                  fucked.

                         JORDAN                                *
           Baby, I talked to the lawyers                       *
           again today. I have some really                     *
           great news. As it turns out you're                  *
           totally off the hook.                               *

                         NAOMI                                 *
           I know that already.                                *

                         JORDAN                                *
           You never did anything wrong                        *
           anyway, right? At the end of the                    *
           day all they really want is for me                  *
           to cooperate - that's it.                           *
           See, apparently, I know so much                     *
           about what's going on in the stock                  *
           market that I could save the                        *
           government years of heartache. But                  *
           it get's even better... You see,                    *
           if I cooperate I'll only have to                    *
           serve four short years and any                      *
           fine I'd have to pay wouldn't be                    *
           due til after I serve my sentence.                  *
           We'll still have plenty of money                    *
           left over. The only thing that I                    *
           was kind of upset about was the                     *
           fact that I might have to give                      *
           them information about my friends.                  *

                         NAOMI                                 *
           Like you said, "There's no friends                  *
           on Wall Street".                                    *

                         JORDAN                                *
           But there's a silver lining to                      *
           that too... It turns out that all                   *
           of `em are probably gonna                           *
           cooperate too. So in the end, that                  *
           won't really be a factor.                           *

                         NAOMI                                 *
           Well, that's really good news,                      *
           honey. I'm really happy for you.                    *

                         JORDAN                                *
           No, it's good for both of us, Nay.                  *

                          NAOMI                                *
           Yeah, yeah.                                         *

                         JORDAN                                *
           Make love to me baby. Make love to                  *
           me nice and slow.                                   *

                         NAOMI                                 *
           No Jordan. Stop!                                    *

       TIME CUT: Jordan is fucking Naomi. It's the best he's          *
       felt in days. While he's lost in it, she's lost interest,      *
       going through the motions perfunctorily.                       *

                  Fuck you.                                           *

After a beat... He cums. Jordan rolls off Naomi. They lie      *
in uncomfortable silence.                                      *

           And I wanted to puke.                               *

Naomi gets up.                                                 *

           will allow you visitation. Don't                    *
           try to fight it. It will save us                    *

Naomi exits to the dressing room. Jordan gets up, follows      *

       Naomi races into the garage. Jordan gets in the drivers        *

                  For the next six hours, I came up
                  with a list. Friends, enemies,
                  business associates, anybody who'd
                  ever known me or taken so much as
                  a stock tip. The first name on
                  the list was Donnie's.

       And as Jordan heaves a huge sigh, we're suddenly...

       where the Brokers spot him, giving him a standing
       ovation. He forces a smile, waves to the crowd.

       As Robbie and Chester Ming look on, Jordan forces a smile
       as he approaches Donnie, who gives him a hug.

                 The trial won't be for months,
                 so obviously I'll be counting on
                 you to pick up the slack.

                               DONNIE
                 Whatever you need, bro.     You know
                 that.

      Jordan reaches in his jacket for a yellow slip of PAPER.

                               JORDAN
                 And you know how much that means
                 to me. Hey, you know what I
                 wanted to ask you?

      Jordan catches Donnie's eye, pushes the PAPER over in
      front of him.

                               JORDAN (CONT'D)
                 The Steve Madden deal, did he
                 ever come through on that?

      Donnie looks down at the paper, reads Jordan's writing:

       "DON'T INCRIMINATE YOURSELF.      I'M WEARING A WIRE."

                               JORDAN (CONT'D)
                 Remember he was supposed to kick
                 back like four mil from that one
                 account?

                               DONNIE
                 Uh... tell you the truth I was so
                 fucked up, I don't really remember
                 anything about that.

      Donnie slips the paper in his jacket, gives Jordan a
      look -- "Thank you." Jordan nods.

                               JORDAN
                 Well if you talk to him, let me
                 know. You want the last
                 yellowtail?

                  But I wasn't losing any sleep
                  over it.

       After a few beats, Violet knocks, enters.      Jordan stirs.

       CLOSE ON DENHAM, reading a New York Times article on
       Jordan's sentencing. He looks satisfied with his
       accomplishment, until he looks up...

       ... and realizes he's right where Jordan said he'd be:
       commuting home on the subway, like any other piker.
                                                                 135.

246   INT. PRISON VAN - DAY (MAR `99)                                     246

      Jordan rides in back, stares out the window, thinking
      about all he's done. The van stops as it arrives at the
      PRISON GATE.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 I'm not ashamed to admit, when we
                 arrived to prison, I was
                 absolutely terrified...

                                    GUARD (O.S.)
                 Belfort!       Fuckin' move!

      Jordan leaps to his feet.

                 I needn't have been.


247   EXT. MINIMUM C PRISON - DAY (SPRING 2000)                           247

      A tennis ball hits pavement and WE PAN UP TO JORDAN, in
      prison fatigues but playing doubles with three other
      PRISONERS, all white middle-aged EXECUTIVE TYPES.

                               JORDAN
                 Sorry, just out. What is that,
                 forty-thirty?

      As the game continues, Jordan serving, the CAMERA PULLS
      UP TO SEE THE WHOLE PRISON YARD: one group of inmates
      does Tai Chi while another has formed a book club.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 For a brief, fleeting moment, I'd
                 forgotten I was rich and lived in
                 America.

                                                             BLACK OUT.

Two hundred people attend Jordan's "Straight Line                *
Persuasion" seminar, watching a massive screen (on which         *
these KIDS have appeared).                                       *

ON-SCREEN: THE "JB" LOGO APPEARS, FOLLOWED BY CLIPS OF           *
JORDAN giving seminars in different locations (see               *
addendum below), edited in with footage of looming               *
economic uncertainties.                                          *

            Ladies and gentlemen, please join                    *
            me in welcoming to Auckland, New                     *
            Zealand... Mr. Jordan Belfort!                       *

BIG APPLAUSE as Jordan takes the stage, waving. This             *
might go on a while. If so, there COULD be TITLES:               *

    Jordan Belfort spent 22 months in federal prison             *
             and paid $100,000,000 in fines.                     *

THEN:                                                            *

        His cellmate was, no fucking joke, Tommy Chong.          *

THEN:                                                            *

Since his release, he's become a multi-millionaire again         *
               as a motivational speaker.                        *

When the applause finally dies down...                           *

...Jordan doesn't speak. Instead he walks down to the            *
front row of his audience, studying faces. He picks one.         *
Takes a pen from his coat and offers it to him.                  *

                          JORDAN                                 *
            Sell me this pen.                                    *

The Kiwi, embarrassed, takes a moment, then:                     *

                          KIWI IN AUDIENCE                       *
            Well, it's a good pen, it's a                        *
            ballpoint --                                         *

Jordan takes the pen back with a smile.        Hands it to the   *
next person.                                                     *
