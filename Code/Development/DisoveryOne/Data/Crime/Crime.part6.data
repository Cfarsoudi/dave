                         FADE IN:

                         BEFORE TITLES:
          The screen is black. First we hear the sound of a
          single trumpet playing slowly and sadly, the notes
          faintly resonant as if echoing through the narrow
          streets of some old hill village in Sicily. Now,
          confusingly, we see a slant of light move past us
          and another, and as our surroundings become more
          visible, we discover that we are moving through a
          pine forest lit by shafts of morning sunlight. Now,.
          suddenly, we come out of the trees and find ourselves
          on the Nevada shore of Lake Tahoe.

          It is a clear, cold morning in September of Nineteen
          Fifty-nine. We now see the Corleone compound at
          lakeside, half-hidden by pines and firs. We move
          toward it, past the gates and guard houses, past
          the guest houses, past the kennels for the guard
          dogs, and finally to the front driveway of the main
          house where a conservative sedan is being loaded by
          a Chauffeur and a pair. of large dark-headed men named
          Al Neri and Rocco Lampone. Rocco limps slightly.
          As suitcases are being placed in the trunk of the
          car, the front door to the main house opens and Tom
          Hagen, a trim, serious, balding man in a business
          suit, appears He crosses to the corner of the house
          and looks off.

          HAGEN'S POINT OF VIEW - THE LAKE AND LKSIDE
          Standing by the shore of the lake is a little boy,.
          Tony Adams Corleone, aged about ten. The boy, dressed
          for travel, is looking off at the lake, his back to-
          ward us.

          REVERSE ANGLE - ON TONY
           As he looks out at the lake we might sense that he
           is troubled and puzzled, although he is managing to
           keep his expression stoic. Hagen can be seen in the
          background, by the house 9 After a moment:

          Time to go.
          There is a beat and Tony composes himself, turns and
          moves up toward the house and Tom Hagen.

          EXT. FRONT OF TAEOE HOUSE AND DRIVEWAY - DAY

          The heavy, black sedan is loaded. Connie Corleane
          and a Housekeeper, in uniform, are bringing Mary,
          about five, out to the car. She too is dressed for
          travelling. As they put her into the car --

          No. Ere wanted me to tell you both
          how sorry he was.

                         (TO CONNIE)
          Aunt Connie ..- ?
          Connie would apparently prefer to avoid answering any
          questions.

                         CONNIE

          Tony gems into the car. He locks out the window to--
          ward the house. We begin XXI-N Ti. TZS 2 C 2=17"s

                         TEE DRIVEWAY
          Hagen is the last one into the car. As it starts down
          the driveway on its way to the airport in Reno, Connie,
          Lampone, Neri and the Housekeeper all wave. The auto-
          matic gate at the foot of the driveway opens. The
          Guard at the gate flicks a half-salute as the Limousine
          passes through.
          TEE GROUP r n FONT OF EOQSE
          As the group breaks, Connie and the Housekeeper going
          back inside, Neri and Lampone drifting off, we pan up-
          ward to a window in the second-story and zoom in.
          Michael Corleone has moved the curtain aside with one
          hand and is looking after the disappearing limousine,
          his expression unreadable-but somehow sad.

          ZNT. AIRLMPR - DAY
          We are close on Tony, looking out the window of the
          airliner, his own expression matching that of his

          Under its fanlight, the front door swings open and

          EXT. NAVY AIM MA.RI Z CORPS STADIUM - DAY

          We are close on a young man, Anthony Adams (Corleone),
          in the uniform of a Midshipman of the Naval Academy
          at Annapolis. We are pulling back as the speaker --
          who is Arne Grundellius, the Secretary of State --
          continues, his accent faintly Scandinavian.

           CRUNDELLIUS' VOICE
          -- there are no limits to the goals
          to which we can each legitimately
          aspire. And now, as an unpopular war
          is ended in East Asia and we set our
          sights on new goals, I leave you with
          the words of another Sailor ---
          We continue to pull back to discover that we are at
          the Navy and Marine Corps stadium. It is a late Spring
          day and in the early-middle Nineteen Seventies. The
          Midshipmen, their parents and guests, are gathered
          for- the graduation ceremonies.

                         GRQNDELLIIIS
          ' Our will is to keep the torch of
          freedom burning for all. To this
          solemn purpose we call on the young,
          the brave and the strong, and the
          free. Heed my call. Come to the
          sea. Come sail with me.'

          During this speech we find we have been. moving through
          the stadium. We find Tony's mother, Ray, among the
          guests. We also see Tony's sister, Mary, about twenty,
          Tom Hagen and Al Neri.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          The speech is over and as the audience applauds, the

          television personality, mainly an interviewer of
          celebrities, although sometime a Newsweman and talk-
          show performer. She is poised, attractive, warm,
          hirp. She is coming out of an office. She crosses
          through the newsroom with its teletypes and general
          sense of activity. A Cameraman comes up to her:

          Tony looks at the knife in his hand, then tosses it

          natious face wreathed in a grin, camas cut of the
          prison gate, his hands held up in the "Victory" sign.
          He pushes his way through the Television Cameramen
          and Newsmen, not saying anything.
          We pan him over to a limousine which he gets into
          quickly. The limousine drives off.

                         NEWSCASTER'S VOICE
          Today in Leavenworth, Kansas, one--
          time International Brotherhood of
          Dockworkers' President, Danny DeVito
          i was. released. on pardon after serving
          six and. a half years of a fifteen
          year sentence an embezzlement and
          conspiracy charges. DeVito didn't
          state his future plans, but insiders
          expect him to challenge the incum-
          bent President, Pat Brady, in the up-
          coming election.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          As Tony comes into the room, Palmateer gives him a

          ible denial. We never invoke it
          until the cock crows thrice.
          As Tony is signing the papers, Palmateer has produced
          a service automatic from a canvas carryi+:g case. He
          puts it on the table before Tony ---

          As a large car pulls up and stops in front of Tony,
          he opens the door and gets into the backseat. We

          As Croce sets the briefcase on his lap, Tony reaches
          into his pocket and gives him the key. Now Croce

          Suddenly the Second Man's knees buckle as. Tony, in a
          lightning move, brings the gun barrel down across the
          Man's head.
          As the Second Man is on his hands and knees, Zi.?ce a

          You were running a no-lose operation.
          if we succeeded, you were rid of
          Vidal. -- if we failed, the Corleone
          family was set up to take the blame.
          Your hands were clean. I was the
          only one who could dispute your
          story and I wasn't supposed to come
          back. I've found out that my res-
          ignation from the Navy was processed
          and accepted a full week before I
          went down here ---

          It's not blackmail. It's a simple
          statement of fact. If anything
          happens to me or if the Corleone

	"I wonder," Toad said to himself presently, "I wonder
	if this sort of car starts easily?"
		Next moment, hardly knowing how it came about, he
	found that he had hold of the handle and was turning
	it. As the familiar sound broke forth, the old
	passion seized on Toad and completely mastered him,
	body and soul ... He increased his pace, and as the
	car devoured the street, he was only conscious
	that he was Toad once more, Toad at his best and
	highest. And he sped he knew not whither, fulfilling
	his instincts, living his hour, reckless of what
	might come to him... "

	-- Kenneth Grahame, "THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS"







	"All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty
	hood... "

	-- Bruce Springsteen, "THUNDER ROAD"









	FADE IN:

	EXT. LONG BEACH STREET - LOWER GRAND - NIGHT

	The streets are empty. Low fog skims the sidewalks below a gray stew
	of a sky. It's slightly fuzzy, slightly surreal.  The vast Port of Los
	Angeles is visible in the b.g... No cars parked here ... No cars
	except -

	A '67 SHELBY MUSTANG GT-500

	Silver with deep grill, its sculptured side panels ending in air
	scoops ... All cock and balls, it stands alone in the lonely cool
	before dawn ... An old-school totem to speed and style... And then
	SOMEONE approaches...

	Through the mists of morning ... In leather coat and jack boots ...
	He's early 30s, with the vaguely whimsical confidence of a shimmer
	that refuses to fade ...

	This is RANDALL RAINES, whom they call MEMPHIS - though know one's
	quite sure why ... But they do know he's the auto-boost in Southern
	California ...

	Memphis approaches the Mustang with a gathering awe ... Like a desert
	crash survivor coming upon an oasis ... He walks around it ...
	Admiring it ... Adoring it ...

	But then a FIREBIRD pulls up alongside him. Its driver -
	ATLEY JACKSON, early 30s, handsome, jocular leans out for:

				ATLEY JACKSON
		You gonna steal her or kneel down to
		her and pray -- ?

	Memphis looks at him, still enthralled...

				ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd)
		I know, I know ... It's Eleanor ...
		Just take her, slick. - -

	And Atley drives off slowly, Memphis looks this way and that ...
	No one about ... He removes a SLIM JIM from a deep pocket in his
	coat... He slims the door panel ... Pops the button ... opens the
	door ...

	Watch him work. Quick as shit. A SCREWDRIVER appears another
	pocket ... He pops the BUTTERFLY to the IGNITION

	A RATCHET appears... He strips the mechanism... Now a GIZMO - a,small
	socket-like device - is pressed into the
	ignition ... A twist of the wrist ... And the 320-bhp 289 V8 rumbles
	like a jackhammer. The whole thing took 20 seconds.

	He takes a cassette TAPE from another pocket ... Slaps it into the
	deck. Bruce Springsteen's "Ramrod" wails from the coaxials.
	And Memphis floors it... And off they tear...

	The look on his face suggests a supreme satisfaction ... A grand
	re-awakening of long-dormant pleasure centers ... A speed Jones,
	fixed and fumy ...

	He slots in behind Atley Jackson's Firebird ... And slotting in
	behind Memphis, in a Z-28, is DONNY ASTRICKY, mid-30s ...

	On they go ... The fore and aft car providing escort...

	Except that, from seemingly out of nowhere --

	A POLICE CAR

	appears behind them...

	And Donny instantly goes into diversionary tactic ... He races
	through a STOP SIGN ... And the cruiser's bubbles flash on ... And
	Donny is pulled-over ... Atley and Memphis drive on in their
	respective vehicles...

	The UNIFORM COP gets out of his car, goes to Donny.

				DONNY
		Problem, Officer?

				POLICEMAN
		Yes. You're under arrest -- ?

				DONNY
		For running a stop sign?

				POLICEMAN
		For Grand Theft Auto -

	And off of Donny's look --

	We go to Memphis in the Shelby... As FOUR CRUISERS comes speeding
	toward him, sirens wailing...

	QUICK SHOTS of Memphis racing the Shelby through the early morning
	harbor town streets ... Sirens peel ... Memphis turns up the music
	... Pins the gas ... The chase is on ...

	Memphis maneuvers the Mustang with a dazzling aplomb... Memphis
	gutterballing the car, skating the shoulder, the cops in heavy
	pursuit ...

	And now he's picked up another CRUISER... He passes Atley Jackson,
	heading in the opposite direction... Atley has picked-up a pair of
	cruisers himself ...

	Memphis on a straightaway now, speeds up, feels the boost. But up
	ahead, a ROADBLOCK has formed... How'd they get that deployed so
	fast? And behind him, the unmarks blaze ...

	Guns his bitch... Straight at the roadblock .. Three CRUISERS and
	a PORTABLE WOODEN BARRICADE... Memphis pins her ... ZOOOOOM! Dead-on
	to the roadblock ...

	And, at the last moment, as the COPS dive out of the way, Memphis
	bangs the gear shift into neutral -- yanks the parking brake --
	And the Mustang spins on the straight -- Screeching spin ... And
	Memphis takes the HARD LEFT ...

	And he's managed to outrun them... Finding himself above Lower
	Grand... Looking down ...

	He can see the secondary pursuit down below ... Atley being
	chased... IN THE DISTANCE - Atley is LAUNCHED FROM THE SHOULDER,
	the Firebird rolling down a drainage culvert ...

	Landing with a sickening thud on its back. Memphis is horrified.

	EXT. LOWER GRAND - LATER

	Rescue team presence. Atley being hauled out of the wreck... His
	leg is a torn mess ... He's barely conscious... A cuffed Donny
	Astricky is dragged to a waiting cruiser ...

	A POLICE CAR pulls up ... And out steps

	DETECTIVE ROLAND CASTLEBECK

	of G.R.A.B. The Governor's Regional Auto-theft Bureau. Castlebeck
	is mid-50s, black, saturnine. - But don't let the tacit nobility
	fool you - the man's a street viper ...

	Castlebeck goes to another cop - HAWKINGS..

				HAWKINGS
		Astricky. And Jackson. No sign of
		Raines...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Well, then it's all for naught,
		ain't it, Hawkings?

	Castlebeck looks out over the mess ... And then looks up...
	Because, further down Lower Grand, a car is parked. It is the
	Shelby. With Memphis leaning against its hood...

	Castlebeck looks around him, but no one's noticed. So he walks
	toward it, hand on hip...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		I know you --

				MEMPHIS
		You know my back -

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		You want to come along quiet?

				MEMPHIS
		How's Atley -- ?

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Leg's all banged-up. He made a
		stupid play ... He'll limp around
		the yard up at Folsom. But
		Astricky will be there to take
		care of him. With their priors,

				MEMPHIS
		Let them go --

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		How's that?

				MEMPHIS
		Let them go. And I'll leave ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		You'll leave -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		You don't have anything on me. A
		misdee auto-theft. I got no record.
		I'll be out in three days, and back at 
		it. Or you let them go, and I give
		you my word. I'm gone. And without the
		ringleader ... Your tee-times have
		just grown exponentially...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		I don't golf...

	And they stare at each other, as Castlebeck considers.

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (cont'd)
		I do this. And I see you again. I'll
		come after you with everything I got.
		you won't be able to steal a glance
		at a blind man without me by your side ...

				MEMPHIS
		You have my word...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Get out of here, then. Now.

	And Memphis makes to get into the Shelby...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Leave the car, Randall ...

	Memphis nods ... Takes one last look at the Shelby... Sorry to 
	leave it behind ... And he runs off into the mists of Lower
	Grand ...

	Castlebeck walks back toward the crime-scene tumult ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Arright, let lim go. Cite him for
		rolling the stop ... And cite old
		Atley for driving to endanger ...

				HAWKINGS
		What are you talking about, Rollie? We're
		springing 'em? Just like that?

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Just like that. Quit your bellyaching,
		Hawkings ... And let's wrap this up ...

		Right. You want to test the voltage drop ...

		See what you got ... You understand -- ?

	Tom starts to say "not really". Instead, he nods. Memphis takes a
	root beer from an old-style machine. He goes out ... front ... To

	Budgy points at a passing car ...

				BUDGY (cont'd)
		That one -

				MEMPHIS
		1980 Mercury Cougar. 255 cubic inch V8 ...
		Based on the Ford Thunderbird bodyshell;
		they modified the chassis, but didn't
		improve its performance...

	Budgy points at another car ... And we get the sense they play
	this game every day...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		The 1970 Plymouth Road Runner. Proof
		positive of a single all-powerful Deity.
		The first bargain-priced muscle car
		ever. They even tuned the horn to
		resemble the "beep beep" sound of the
		cartoon Road Runner ...

	And Budgy looks impressed... As always ...

				BUDGY
		Damn, you're good

	Memphis nods ... Sips his root beer ...

				BUDGY (cont'd)
		You got to bingo last night?

	Memphis looks at him ... Can't believe it himself ...

		That I did, Budgy. That I did --

	And, from inside the garage, there's the most horrific GRIND of
	metal on metal, as Tom has started the Plymouth -

	In moments, the V8's massive 349bhp is bellowing... And Mirror Man
	climbs in beside him... And off they go ... Laying several inches
	of English rubber. Over the broken glass and out of the
	showroom...

	EXT. CITY STREETS - PALOS VERDES - NIGHT

	The Lotus races through these streets ... At high speeds ...

				MIRROR MAN
		Newsflash, Kip: you're driving a
		stolen car

	Kip smiles over the ascending speedometer --

				KIP
		Yeah. Ain't it great -- ?

	And he pins her ... VROOOOOM -- !

									CUT TO:

	A TENNIS BALL

	being bounced against the wall ... Caught ... Bounced again ...
	Thunk! Thunk! Thunk!

	INT. WAREHOUSE - LONG BEACH HARBOR - NIGHT

	A dozen purloined AUTOS are parked here ... And a number of
	SHIPPING CONTAINERS ... A thuggish MAN reads the paper ... The
	tennis ball bouncer is TUMBLER, 20 ... And he's sitting on a
	tilted back chair, and wall-bouncing the ball and annoying the
	piss out of

	ATLEY JACKSON

	whom we remember from the drop-car at our opening ... Atley walks
	with a LIMP now... Thunk! Thunk! Thunk!

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Can you stop that, for Chrissake?

				TUMBLER
		What's your problem, bro ?

	Thunk! Thunk!

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Where are they -- ?

				TUMBLER
		They'll be here. You nervous, bro? You? Back
		in the day, they say you had anti-freeze in
		them veins ... What happened -- ?

	And Atley intercepts the tennis ball ... And hurls it over to the
	far side of the warehouse ... Tumbler merely grins ...

				TUMBLER (cont'd)
		Relax and enjoy --

	EXT. SAN PEDRO STREETS - THE LOTUS

	Heading for Long Beach... Stopped at a light ... A CAMARO pulls up
	next to them... A KID behind the wheel, a BLONDE beside him...

	Kip eyeballs them... Engines are revved... Challenges are
	implied... Mirror Man panics ...

				MIRROR MAN
		Stolen car, Kip. Stolen car, stolen car,
		stolen car ...

				KIP
		Stolen fast car...

	And the light turns green ... And he pops the clutch ... And
	they are off ... It's a good old fashioned drag race ... Kip
	smiles at the blonde ... Mirror Man is freaking out ... Kip's
	eyes are on fire ... He clocks the speedometer ...

				KIP (cont'd)
		It's calibrated for 140 ... Let's see
		if these British boys are full of shit
		or not --

				MIRROR MAN
		No way, man --

	Yes, way. Kip floors it. They bury the Camaro in its wake... The
	gauge rising ... 90, 100, 110 ... Mirror Man is having an
	embolism...

	They warp-speed by a POLICE CRUISER... Both kids totally unaware
	of the POLICE CHOPPER up on high... With them in its sights ...
	And they drive ... At last, ending up at --

	THE WATERFRONT - A dark latticework of docks and wharves,
	warehouses and shipping crates... The freighters are somehow
	graceful against the moonlit water ...

	INT. WAREHOUSE

	Tumbler studies his watch... Now he's a little concerned ... He
	looks up ... Atley is glaring at him...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Something wrong, Tumbler -- ?

				TUMBLER
		Yeah. I'm missing Springer --

	And then the Lotus pulls into the warehouse... Tumbler flashes
	Atley a "told-you-so" smile... Kip and Mirror Man get out of the
	car...

	Kip walks over to a CLIPBOARD with a magic marker tethered to it
	... It is a list of cars ... He draws a black line through "13)
	1996 Lotus Esprit V8"... The others are clocking the car...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		She'll go 0 to 60 in 4.9 seconds --

				MIRROR MAN
		I can vouch for that.

	Tumbler passes out 40 oz.s ... The vibe is celebratory...

				TUMBLER
		Thirteen down ... Thirty-seven to go ...

				KIP
		No problem -

	Bottles are clinked... Beer is sipped ... Only, a HOT WHITE
	SPOTLIGHT bores through the skylight ... And the whup-whup of the
	chopper's ROTORS... And now the sounds of SIRENS ... And the 
	thuggish man gets to his feet ...

				THUGGISH MAN
		Let's get outta here -- !

	And they do... Heading out the back ... It's tough for Atley with
	his limp ... On the way out:

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Now you gone and done it, Raines
		And they flee ...

	INT. WAREHOUSE - LATER - NIGHT

	A HALF-DOZEN POLICE CARS. The CHOPPER does the usual
	spotlight-trailing... It's turned into a total pig
	circus ... A car pulls to a stop ... And out steps Detective
	Roland Castlebeck, whom we remember from our opening...

	INT. WAREHOUSE

	Castlebeck surmises the take ... The cars ... His partner
	DETECTIVE DRYCOFF - a sneering Irish boy with zero patience -
	comes out from the back ...

				DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
		They're gone...

	Castlebeck nods ... Looks at the cars ...

	INT. "L.N. ORR AUTOMOTIVE" - INDEPENDENCE - DUSK

	Memphis goes through invoices in the cluttered back office. When a
	brand new purple MERCEDES SLK, windows tinted, pulls in out front.
	It looks oddly anachronistic here in Independence. Memphis senses
	danger. He goes out. Budgy and his dog are here... Budgy looks
	spooked... Tom, too ...

				MEMPHIS
		What's going on -- ?

	And standing there, by the Mercedes, like a wraith, is ATLEY
	JACKSON, in long leather coat, smoking a cigarette ... As out of
	place here as a maggot on a muffin...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Well, well, well ...

	And he begins to sing...

				ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd)
			(ANDY GRIFFITH theme)
		Da-doo-doo-doo-da-doo-doo-doo, etc.
			(laughs)
		Are you kidding me, man -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Hello, Atley ...

				ATLEY JACKSON (re: sign)
		L.N. ORR. I get it. Clever ...

	Memphis studies him...

				MEMPHIS
		How's the leg?

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Only hurts when I breathe. Lookit
		you. Where are Barney Fife and Aunt
		Bea hanging out? And Opie ... Where's
		Opie at?

	He laughs some more ... Chain-lights his cig ...

				MEMPHIS
		What are you doing here?

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Is there someplace we can talk?

	Memphis looks at him...

				MEMPHIS
		What about?

				ATLEY JACKSON
		About your brother. And the deeeep
		shit he's in --

	INT. TEDDY'S TAVERN - NIGHT

	A BARMAID sets down a pitcher of beer and two mugs...

				WAITRESS
		There you go --

				MEMPHIS
		Thanks, Donna --

	She leaves... Atley is staring at him... Memphis shrugs...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		It's been a long time, Memphis --

				MEMPHIS
		Six years ...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it?
		Six years ago we were fartin' through
		Armani and pissin' Cristal.
		Now look at us ...

		MEMPHIS
		Tell me about Kip -

	Atley takes a sip of his beer,...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		He took a job. And he fumbled it.
		Now he's jammed-up. Jammed-up bad...

				MEMPHIS
		What kind of job... ?

				ATLEY JACKSON
		A boost. A big boost ...

				MEMPHIS
		A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost?

	Atley frowns ... Looks at him...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		You're shittin', right?

	Clearly Memphis is not ...

				ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd)
		Kip's become quite the little
		crewrunner since you left. He's been
		working a low-rent ring for
		two years now. You don't talk to
		your Ma?

				MEMPHIS
		It seems she neglected to mention it

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Maybe she don't know. Although I don't
		see how that could be. Maybe she didn't
		want to upset you -

				MEMPHIS
		Don't feel the need to explore my family
		dynamics, Atley...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		The point is: Kip's been living the
		life. Only he's a wild child. Crazy.
		Makes our old behavior seem like
		altar boy time. But he fungold this
		one so bad, folks around L.B.
		are already speakin' about him in
		the past tense.

	Memphis takes a beat ... Sips at his brew ... Then:

				MEMPHIS
		Who was the job for?

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Who do you think?

	Memphis waits ... In no mood for guessing games ...

				ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd)
		Calitri, man. Raymond "The Carpenter"
		Calitri ... Your favorite and mine ...

	Which means nothing to us ... Though the look on Memphis, face
	speaks volumes ...

				ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd)
		I just thought you should know,
		man. I kind of had a feeling you
		didn't. But I should tell you:
		I'm working for him now - The
		Carpenter - so if you see him, you
		won't mention me coming to get
		you... Like I said: I just thought
		... I owed you ... And that it was
		the right thing to do ...

	Memphis nods ... His face clenched in despair. We FADE TO BLACK,
	As a SUPER on-screen reads: PART 1: STOLEN MOMENTS

	We PRE-LAP J. Geils Band's "Hard-Drivin' Man" and CUT TO:

	THREE PLATES OF BACON, EGGS AND HASH BROWNS

	placed on the service deck by a short-order COOK...

	INT. RUBY'S ALL-NITE - LONG BEACH - NIGHT

	A 24-hour diner in the heart of Long Beach... The three plates are
	picked-up with an impressive dexterity by

	HELEN RAINES

	early 60s, clear-eyed... In pink Ruby's uniform and chunky
	shoes... Black currant hair striated with wisps of gray... Helen
	delivers the plates to a booth of college kids ...

				KID
		Can I get some more coffee -- ?

				HELEN RAINES
		Sure, hon ...

	And she goes to the coffee station... When

				MEMPHIS (O.S.)
		Who's a guy gotta know to get a tuna
		melt in this joint -- ?

	And she turns around to see Memphis standing there. Her expression
	displays many things ... Most of them joy ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Hello, Ma --

	And she goes to Memphis ... Wraps her arms around him ... Squeezes
	tight ...

				HELEN RAINES (cont'd)
		Oh, Randall ...

	She takes his head in her hands ... Kisses his cheek ... Then the
	other... Hugs on ... Unmindful of the customers ... The cook
	smiles from behind the order wheel ...

				COOK
		What's the word, Memphis -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		How ya doing, Ruby -- ?

				HELEN RAINES
		Come, come, come ...

	And she leads him over to a booth ... Barking to the cook - RUBY -
	on the way...

				HELEN RAINES (cont'd)
		Tuna melt on pumpernickel.  Provolone,
		extra tomato, Dijon... And a chocolate
		milk... Lots of syrup...
			(to Memphis)
		Right?

				MEMPHIS
		Right ...

	And they settle in ... Across the booth from each other ... She
	takes his hands...

				HELEN RAINES
		You look good...

				MEMPHIS
		You, too, Ma...

				HELEN RAINES
		What are you doing back?

				MEMPHIS
		How's Kip?

	And Helen flushes, a bit ashamed maybe ...

				HELEN RAINES
		Have you seen him?

				MEMPHIS
		No.

				HELEN RAINES
		oh.

				MEMPHIS
		Atley Jackson came to see me ...

				HELEN RAINES
		Atley Jackson. How is that one?
		How's the leg... ?

	He looks at her ... Beat ...

				MEMPHIS
		Why didn't you tell me?

				HELEN RAINES
		I couldn't. I didn't want you to
		worry. I thought held sort himself
		out. I hardly see him. He comes and
		goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?

				MEMPHIS
		He's in some trouble ...

				HELEN RAINES
		I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a
		different boy. He's lost that... That
		sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't
		know what to do ...

				MEMPHIS
		You getting my checks ... ?

				HELEN RAINES
		Of course ...

	ANGLE - RUBY. He's on the PHONE in the kitchen...One eye
	on Memphis and Helen --

				RUBY
		Detective Castlebeck... It's me ...
		Yeah... You ain't never gonna guess
		who just come in to visit his Ma --

	BACK TO - MEMPHIS AND HELEN RAINES ...

				HELEN RAINES (cont'd)
		You haven't spoken to him in a
		while, I guess...

				MEMPHIS
		He doesn't return my calls. or my
		letters ...

				HELEN RAINES
		Kipling was sixteen when you left, baby.
		I don't know what you remember of him.
		But you should brace yourself

	And, on her sad smile, we PRE-LAP Sammy Hagar's "I Can't Drive 55"
	and SLAM CUT TO:

	INT. "THE SIDE POCKET" - POOL HALL - NIGHT

	A dozen tables... Smells of blue chalk and whiskey... The juke box
	cranked... We take it to the back of the joint ... Where Kip, and
	Tumbler and Mirror Man are knocking a rack... Freb sits nearby,
	with a few badly made-up GIRLS...

				TUMBLER
		... so ... It's my new move ... It's called
		"The Stranger." What I do is, I sit on
		my hand for 10 minutes.  Till it falls
		asleep. Till it's good and numb. No feeling.
		And then I jerk off.

				GIRL
		That's disgusting -

				FREB
		What's the point, man -- ?

				TUMBLER
		Cos it's like you're bein' done by a stranger
		... It rocks ... It's the power move of the
		New Millennium...

	He sinks another ball. A kid, 15, TOBY - comes up to them.

				TOBY
		Hey, Kip, what's up?

				KIP
		What do you say, Toby?,

				TOBY
		I'm cool -

				TUMBLER
		What do you want, shithead?

				TOBY
		Why you gotta front me like that? I'm
		talking to Kip --

				TUMBLER
		Why don't you leave him alone?

				TOBY
		I known Kip longing than you, man ...

				TUMBLER
		Oooh, ain't you the lucky duck --

				FREB
		Any word, Kip -- ?

				KIP
		No ... And they won't take my calls ...

				FREB
		What does that mean -- ?

				KIP
		It ain't what you'd call a "good sign"

	He groks their fear...

				KIP (cont'd)
		Look - we managed to get 13 in a week.
		We just gotta step it up ...

				FREB
		But we only got till Friday. That's
		four days. And we lost the 13. So's
		we gotta start over ...

	Kip looks at him...

				KIP
		That, too ...
			(off of Freb's look of fright)
		Don't sweat it, Freb. We're cool.

	ANGLE THE FRONT DOOR. For Memphis has entered. He
	clocks the room. Sees them at the rear ... Walks back

				KIP
		It can be done, man. We just gotta
		step it up... It's a challenge ...

				MIRROR MAN
		The challenge is not to get our nuts
		cut-off and shoved down our throats ...

				TUMBLER
		Can I help you, pal -- ?

	And Kip looks up ... To see Memphis there ...

				MEMPHIS
		Hey, Kip ...

				KIP
		Hello, Memphis --

				TUMBLER
		"Memphis?" You're Memphis?

				MEMPHIS
		That's right...

				TUMBLER
		Damn. Damn, damn, damn ...

				FREB
		Memphis. Holy shit. It's an honor,
		man --

	And he pumps his hand... Memphis continues to stare at Kip

				KIP
		It's good to see ya, man. You changed
		your look -

				MEMPHIS
		You, too

	Hold the stare... The others are excited...

				FREB
		What are you doing back, Memphis?

				MEMPHIS
		Little visit. Check on the family.

				KIP
		It's nice to see ya, man -

	He smiles ... Memphis eyeballs him... Toby is there ...

				TOBY
		Hey, Memphis. Remember me? Toby
		Walker. I live next door ...

				MEMPHIS
		Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up

				TOBY
		Yeah, I'm cool ...

	And Memphis turns back to Kip, who's picked up a pool cue.

				KIP
		Who's got next game -- ?

	And he makes to rack 'em up ... Then:

				MIRROR MAN
		I get it. You ain't gotta be a genius:
		Memphis come back to save our bacon!

				TUMBLER
		Shut-up, Mirror Man --

				FREB
		Izzat true? You come back to save our
		bacon?

				MIRROR MAN
		Of course it's true. He come to save
		his brother's dangling ass --

				KIP
		That can't be it. Cos we don't need
		saving

				FREB
		We don't -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		He give you an advance -- ?

				MIRROR MAN
		Hell, yeah. Ten larger man

	Kip shoots him a look... As if he's spoken out of turn ...

				MEMPHIS
		You just give 'im back the money.
		All's well...

	The others look glum... Kip laughs ... Long and hard...

				KIP
		"Give lim back the money." "Give 'im
		back the money..." Be nice. If only
		we didn't drink the money. And smoke
		the money. And buy Nikes with the
		money. And Sony Play Stations with the
		money. And dirty girls with the
		money...

	And Kip sinks a ball ... Memphis looks at the others ... They
	nod... It's true ... The money's gone ...

				KIP
		But don't worry, man. Things are all
		sweetness and light here...

				TUMBLER
		Things are all leafy and suburban ...

				MIRROR MAN
		The hell they are --

				KIP
		Sure they are. Although we do appreciate the
		gesture, Memphis. But we do got it handled...
		And it was nice to see you -- -

	Memphis nods ... Looks at all of them... Smiles ... And then
	REACHES OUT, GRABBING Kip by the collar, yanking him to his feet
	and in close, nose to nose ...

				MEMPHIS
		You listen to me, baby brother. You fancy
		yourself some reat neat tough guy scumbum,
		well, woop-tee-doo, little puppy with a
		poundcake. But I remember the days when you
		used to steal my Colorforms and eat 'em...
		So you can't stop me from saving your
		"dangling ass' if that's what I feel like
		doing...

	And with that, he shoves Kip back down into his seat, toppling the
	table, bottles and glasses crashing... And barrels away from them,
	the crowd parting like a wound...

	Kip's crew left stunned, flustered, and maybe a bit impressed...

				TUMBLER
		Damn... Homeboy's on the dazzle ...

	And, off of Kip's furious look, we CUT TO:

	EXT. LONG BEACH HARBOR - NIGHT

	A chill in the air. Memphis walks toward a range of lowslung
	buildings ...

	EXT. WOODBURN SCRAP AND METAL - NIGHT

	A virtual cityscape of dismantled automobile carcasses, piled up
	high for as far as the eye can see ... A huge FORK LIFT scoops up
	a wreck and hauls it over to the CRUSHER... Watch as the car is
	FLATTENED, for easy shelving ...

	Midnight auto nonpareil ... To one side of the yard is a GARAGE:
	Watch as a HONDA ACCORD, with a BLOODY WINDSHIELD, enters the
	garage. A young Mexican KID driving.

	A SIGN: "LOCK YOUR CAR OR IT MAY BE GONE IN 60 SECONDS!"

	INT. GARAGE - CHOP SHOP

	A CAR is CHOPPED ... Pulled apart ... Fenders, doors, panels,
	interiors, air bags ...

	EXT. WOODBURN SCRAP AND METAL - FRONT ENTRANCE

	Memphis knocks on the door ... A dog-faced MAN opens it ...

				DOG-FACE
		Yeah -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Randall Raines to see Mr. Calitri ...

	INT. WOODBURN SCRAP AND METAL

	Memphis follows Dog-face to the back of this building. Follows him
	into another room. Which is

	A WORKSHOP

	An enormous WOODWORKING SHOP, fully tricked-out with state-of-the-
	art table saws and drill presses, jointers and power planes.

	An antique treadle lathe stands in one corner. A stock layout of
	expensive woods - oak, birch, maple, cherry, mahogany - is stacked
	against the rear wall ...

	Jars and bottles and cakes of glues, resins, stains and bleaches
	cram a shelf unit ... There's a MAN here, at a band saw. This is
	RAYMOND CALITRI, 59 ...

	He wears an apron, protective glasses and a lopsided sneer. A
	Richard Widmark motherfucker - with the diamond hard look of a
	cobra. The liegelord of downtown...

	And now he works the a hand saw, making critical cross-cuts on a
	wide panel of maple ... Atley Jackson is here as well ... As noisy
	as it is out in the yard, in here, once the door is closed, it's
	as SILENT-as a tomb...

	A BANK OF MONITORS on one wall show the cars being crushed and
	disassembled in the yard. Memphis is led into the room.

	Calitri nods and Dog-face leaves the room... Calitri smiles ...
	Examines his fresh cut...

				CALITRI
		Randall Raines ... It's been a long time ...
			(looks at his clothes;)
			frowns)
		'though I do I recall you as a man
		with style. You remember your old
		friend, Atley -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		How ya doing?

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Good to see you, Memphis --

				CALITRI
		So. What do we owe the honor -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		It's about my brother ... Kip...

				CALITRI
		Yes ... Kip ...

	He says the name like other men say "cancer." The phone on
	his desk BLINKS. Calitri picks it up. Listens. Looks at
	one of the monitors. Where the Mexican man is talking to
	several Calitri EMPLOYEES. Calitri hangs up...

				CALITRI
		Excuse me one moment, Randall ...

	And he picks up a MORTISE CHISEL on his way out. Palming it ...

	INT. GARAGE - THE MEXICAN MAN

	is sobbing. As Raymond Calitri marches toward him, glancing at the
	bloodied windshield.

				CALITRI
		You bring this to me in this
		condition? Blood and guts all
		over it? You make me complicit?
		On my property? Who taught you
		how to think? And worst of all:
		weren't there supposed to be two
		Hondas?

				THIEF
		Please ...

	And Calitri, rapid-fire, PUNCTURES the man's belly and chest and
	legs with the chisel, old-school prison-shiv style ... Until the
	man is on the floor, howling ...

				CALITRI
		Stupid sonuvabitch...

	INT. CALITRI'S WORKSHOP

	Memphis can-see this from one of the monitors. He looks at
	Atley...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Car-jacker. Neglected to clean up after
		himself ...

				MEMPHIS
		Jesus ...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		The business has changed...

	Calitri is back, wiping the sweat from his brow with a rag.

				CALITRI
		Now. Where were we? Oh, yes. Kip.

				MEMPHIS
		I don't want him hurt...

	Calitri looks at him, then waves a hand around the shop...

				CALITRI
		I'm proud of this work. The bird
		feeder. The wagon wheel planter.
		The dollhouse. The drop-leaf movable
		server...

	He gestures to each item - exquisitely-rendered woodwork. Then
	gestures to the yard...

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		Metal. Steel. It's cold. Ugly. Wood
		is warm. Clean. Provided by nature.
		To see a piece of furniture take shape.
		It's like watching a child grow ...

	Memphis glances to Atley... Atley shrugs ...

				MEMPHIS
		I'm sure you're working your way to
		the point.  I'll wait right here ...

	Calitri blinks. Smiles. Nods...

				CALITRI
		My point. Yes. Simple, really. I require
		the best. I insist on the best. I only
		engage the best.  Your brother. His
		friends. They came to me. They wanted my
		paper. He was your brother. You were the
		best. Now. They've brought so much
		goddamn heat down, I may not be able to
		fill this order. Which would be very bad
		for me. Which in turn, is very bad for
		them...

				MEMPHIS
		I could kill you. That occurred to me.
		When I first heard about this. That I
		would kill you ...

				CALITRI
		Grow up. You don't kill people like me.
		People like me die in their sleep at
		87 ... Do you know why? Because if
		you did kill me, and everyone knew it
		was you - for the next ten years they'd
		be finding pieces of those you love
		scattered all over California ...

	Memphis nods, notes a PISTOL, resting on a shelf nearby.

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		No, no. You don't kill me, because
		you can't. You don't take your brother
		and run, because we'd find him. You
		don't go to the-police, because we have
		friends there, too. You do nothing:
		except deal with me.

	Memphis eyes him...

				MEMPHIS
		I can come up with the front money.
		Pay you back...

				CALITRI
		Were it only that easy. I have
		obligations. The order needs to be
		filled...

	Calitri takes a manila ENVELOPE from his desk... Hands it to
	Memphis, who takes out the SINGLE SHEET OF PAPER inside.

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		On that list, you'll find fifty cars.
		Fifty. Five-zero. They range in
		age from the 1956 Ford Thunderbird
		to the 1999 Toyota Camry; and in
		expense from the 1993 Volkswagen
		Jetta to the 1988 Lamborghini
		Countach. Fifty cars. Five-zero.

	Memphis scans the list ... Looks up at Calitri ...

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		There is a container ship in Long
		Beach Harbor. Pier 14. Ready to be
		loaded with 4-car-per shipping
		containers, false-walled and
		customsprofiled as motor oil
		designated. The ship leaves in four
		days for South America and the
		men who've tendered me this contract ...

				MEMPHIS
		They gave you only four days?

				CALITRI
		They gave me two weeks. I wasted most of it
		with your brother and his crew, who not
		only lost what pitiful few they managed
		to boost, but also alerted the heat as to our
		endeavor, making this even more difficult
		to achieve ...

	Memphis scans the list ...

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		Four days. 50 cars. I'm paying 200
		thousand dollars ...

	Now Memphis looks up...

				MEMPHIS
		I'm not interested --

				CALITRI
		I knew you'd say that.

				MEMPHIS
		I'm just here about my brother.

				CALITRI
		I knew you'd say that, too --

	Calitri smiles ... Memphis 'looks at him... At Atley Realizing
	the trap ...

				MEMPHIS
		Sound it out for me.

				CALITRI
		Your brother has four days. Fifty
		cars. Five-zero. For that he gets

				MEMPHIS
		And if he doesn't make it -- ?

	Calitri goes to one corner of the shop... Takes a tarp off
	of a full couch MAHOGANY CASKET...

				CALITRI
		I made this, too. My first one.
		Brass extension handles, not plated.
		The coverings are silk, not rayon.
		Expensive hardwood. And lined with
		spray green Lorraine crepe ...

	Memphis waits, knowing where this is going --

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		Yes, yes. I made it for young Kip. In
		case he fails. At 8:00 Friday morning,
		if that ship sets off without my
		fifty ... Kip will take up permanent
		residence in this box ...

	Calitri WALL SWITCH and the a corrugated steel SLIDING DOOR is
	RAISED, revealing a LOADING DOCK facing the back of the yard... Two
	MEN are working out there... DIGGER AND BUTZ scuzzy dudes, mid-30s
	and dressed in dirty coveralls ...

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		Come here for a second, boys --

	And they come over --

				DIGGER
		Evenin', Mr. C. --

				CALITRI
		Digger, Butz: let me introduce
		you to Randall Raines. Used to
		head up the dandiest ring in
		Southern Cal. Left us
		for parts unknown. Randall, this
		is Digger. And that's Butz -

				DIGGER
		Hi, Randall --

	Memphis says nothing. Calitri grins ... Nods to Digger an Butz,
	who go back to work...

				CALITRI
		Digger and Butz will be in charge of burial.
		They're good boys ...

	Memphis' look is cold and furious ... Plaintive:

				MEMPHIS
		I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...

				CALITRI
		"don't want" the Dodgers to lose or
		the summer to end. But we
		don't get to choose these things...

	Atley hits the wall-switch and the steel door slides shut. Calitri
	turns to Memphis...

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		"Nothing that's forced can ever be
		right." Old woodworking expression.
		I really don't care how the 50
		get onto my ship ... I just care
		that they do. You decide.

	With that, he puts his protective glasses back on - and fires up
	an abrasive-disc-finishing machine, adjusting the miter gage and
	beginning to sand the Outside curve of an angled chamfer.

	EXT. HELEN RAINES' HOUSE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

	A small New England-style shingle and clapboard, up on a hill
	overlooking the port. A small GUEST-HOUSE behind it ...

	INT. HELEN RAINES' HOUSE

	Helen clears away the dinner dishes ... The TV is on. The news. We
	see a CRIME SCENE ...

				REPORTER

		Sullivan, the 44-year-old mother of
		three, dead, occurred last night at ...

	Memphis glances to the TV... Grimaces ... He looks out the window
	... At the SEDAN parked below...

	EXT. RAINES' HOUSE - NIGHT

	Memphis comes out ... Moves to the sedan parked across the street
	... it is Detectives Castlebeck and Drycoff...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		I know you.

				MEMPHIS
		You know my back.

	They get out of the car... The view of San Pedro from up here is a
	spectacular bedspread of lights ...

				DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
		When'd you get to town, Raines?

				MEMPHIS
		The other day....

				DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
		What for?

				MEMPHIS
		No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I
		heard we got Shaquille ...

				DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
		Where you been, anyway?

				MEMPHIS
		Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my
		collection of refrigerator magnets ...

				DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
		You seem a little hinked-up ...

				MEMPHIS
		Not at all ...

	He and Castlebeck lock eyes ... Castlebeck takes a pear from his
	coat pocket ... Sets to polishing it ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		I remember us having made some
		kind of deal, Randall. I don't
		remember this deal having some kind
		of time-limit. I look at you -
		here - in my town - and I'm
		confused...

				MEMPHIS
		A little family emergency --

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		I hope it's not your dear sweet
		mother...

				MEMPHIS
		No...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Or your baby brother. What was his
		name?

				MEMPHIS
		Kip.

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Yes, Kip. Short for Kipling.
		Named for the English writer
		of stories about India ...
		He bites into his pear ...
		Memphis says nothing, waits ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (cont'd)
		I got a rash of thefts.  A new crew is
		making noise. We recovered a big take -
		last week...

				MEMPHIS
		And this has what to do with me?

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		I don't know. But you shouldn't
		be here. Take care of your business.
		I'll give you 24 hours. And
		then I don't want to see your face.
		Ever again. Make a fool of me
		once, that's my bad. Make a fool of
		me twice. That's really my
		bad, and I'll kick your ass from
		here to India ...

	Castlebeck gives him a long look... As they walk back to the car...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Good. Cos you know how it plays.
		Six years ago, I let you go free. But
		the next time ... The next time sends
		you away for'a long, long while ...

				DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
		By the time you get out, asshole, there
		won't even be cars. We'll all be cruisin'

	Kip comes out of the club... Toby follows ...

				TOBY
		You goin' home?

				KIP
		Yeah... You want a ride...

				TOBY
		Sure -

				KIP
		How'd you get here? Your Moms give you
		ride -- ?

				TOBY
		Hell, no. I boosted a 'Vette.

				KIP
		You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it?

				TOBY
		I dunno. It was right here. Someone
		musta' boosted it back...

				KIP
		Damn crooks is everywhere --

	They smile...And go to Kip's TRANS AM...

				TOBY (cont'd)
		Memphis seemed weird, huh? What's with
		them clothes? He a farmer now or
		something?

	And this seems funny to Kip... He smiles..

				KIP 
		Yeah. Except the only thing he's growing
		is old...

	And they are fronted by TWO GOONS ... Who toss them up against the
	wall...

				KIP (cont'd)
		What do you want -- ?

	One of the goons SOCKS Toby in the gut. Toby doubles over. Kip
	strains to intervene, but his goon holds him back --

				KIP
		Don't you do that! You leave him alone!

				GOON
		Shaddup, Raines

				KIP
		He's got nothing to do with this --

	And the goon punches him in the face. And Kip goes down. And out.

				GOON
		Get him in the car

	EXT. WOODBURN SCRAP AND METAL - NIGHT

	Kip comes to. In his car. Hot white lights blind him. The Trans
	Am is in the crusher. FIGURES above him. Calitri. The goons ...

				CALITRI
		Hello, Kip --

	Kip tries to get out. The doors are pinned by the forklift.

				KIP
		Lemme out of this --

				CALITRI
		Were it only that easy --

				KIP
		We can still do it --

	Calitri nods ... And the crusher presses ... The roof caves a bit
	... Kip is close to scrunch ...

				CALITRI
		No you can't. Flies on sherbert is what you
		remind me of. Because just being attracted
		to something, doesn't mean you belong...

	INT. CALITRI'S WOODSHOP

	Atley is here, watching Calitri and Kip. one of the monitors. He's
	miserable. But there is nothing he can do.

	EXT. SCRAPYARD - NIGHT

	Kip continues to struggle free...

				KIP
		Listen, Calitri --

				CALITRI
		Call me "Ray." Better yet: call me
		"asshole." Cos that's how you've
		treated me --

				KIP
		I get out of this I'm gonna fuck
		you up --

	Calitri does have to admire the stones on the kid. But. Another
	nod. Another crusher-press. Another scrunch...

				KIP (cont'd)
		Calitri -- !

	Nothing. Silence. Kip peers through the slit that the
	side window has become ... Only they are gone ... And there
	is another awful NOISE ... Kip strains to discern its
	origin ... Only he can't get the angle ...

	We can. It's a huge CRANE, tipped with a GRIPPING CLAW... It is
	maneuvered over the Trans Am... Grasps it. . . And LIFTS IT 
	INTO THE AIR ... Kip, terrified, inside ...

	And, as the crane dangles the Trans Am toward the black waters of
	the harbor, we CUT TO:

	INT. HELEN RAINES' HOUSE - KITCHEN

	Memphis is at the kitchen table. The list of cars before him. He's
	making notations. He gets to his feet ... He goes to check on his
	mother ... She's asleep in her room... He closes the door ...

	And goes back to the kitchen. He goes to a framed PHOTOGRAPH - of
	he and Kip. Earlier times. Happier times.

	When there is an enormous THUD! From outside. Memphis goes to a
	window. Sees a RAMP TRUCK unloading a gnarled blob of metal.
	Memphis runs outside. Just as the ramp truck drives off ...

	Memphis goes to the mangled Trans Am... Leans down ... And there's
	Kip ... Seriously smooshed in the flattened car.

				MEMPHIS
		Kip -- ?

				KIP
		Yeah ...

				MEMPHIS
		You all right -- ?

				KIP
		I think so. There's things I can't
		feel right now. Like my feet. But ...
		You think you can get me outta this,
		Memphis? I'd appreciate it -

				MEMPHIS
		Just hold-on there --

	Memphis goes to the garage ... Finds a crowbar, an acetylene
	TORCH, tin-snips ... He goes back to the wrecked car... And sets
	to work... He looks at Kip ... Shakes his head...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		So you want to run that part by me
		again about things being "all
		sweetness and light..."

				KIP
		This has nothing to do with any
		of that --

				MEMPHIS
		Oh. You maybe have more than one
		enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?

				KIP
		All my enemies own car crushers. 
		It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...

				MEMPHIS
		Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost
		there...

	Indeed... Memphis has freed him ... Kip crawls from the wreckage
	... His clothes in tatters... Blood seeps from a variety of
	contusions ... He limps ... Memphis helps him to the guest house
	...

	INT. KIP'S GUEST HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT

	Small, cluttered... Posters of Kurt Cobain, a skying Kobe Bryant,
	Pamela Anderson, two nude girls draped over a glittering
	Lamborghini Espada, etc. There's a fish tank... And a big-screen
	TV, on which the Lakers are currently defending a high-speed
	Boston Celtic fast-break...

	Memphis sits on a ratty couch before the TV... Kip comes out of
	the bedroom... He's changed clothes ... He wears clunky fur-lined
	MOON BOOTS, leopard-skin Speedos and a tshirt ... He looks
	slightly ridiculous...

	Throughout the scene, Memphis should be studying Kip, as if he's
	seeing him for the very first time ... And waiting for the
	inevitable crack...

				MEMPHIS
		You okay -- ?

				KIP
		Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer,
		man -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Sure --

	And Kip limps toward the refrigerator ... He comes back with two
	beers ... Hands one to Memphis ... Glances at the TV --

				KIP
		you like Kobe's game? I do. You
		think he's heir apparent to MJ? I do.
		He speaks fluent Italian, you know? So he's
		got that going for him --

	And a cut on Kip's forehead starts to bleed ... Kip grabs a towel
	... Presses it to his head --

				MEMPHIS
		You sure you're okay -- ?

				KIP
		Yeah, man. Where is your beer?

	Memphis holds it up ... Kip nods ... There are a pile of IGNITIONS
	on the table ... Kip picks one up, absently begins trying to strip
	it...

				KIP
		Cool. So you're living up North?

				MEMPHIS
		Yeah -

				KIP
		I heard you were pumping gas -

				MEMPHIS
		Something like that -

				KIP
		You're kind of cultivating a new look.

				MEMPHIS
		Yeah --

	Beat ... They watch the game ... Kip replaces the soaked towel
	with another ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Maybe you need a stitch --

				KIP
		Nah. It's a scratch.

				MEMPHIS
		Okay --

	Beat ...

				KIP
		Hey, you want something to eat ?

				MEMPHIS
		What do you got ... ?

	And Kip hoists himself painfully to his feet ... Limps over to the
	'fridge ... Memphis watches him, a slight grin at Kip's attempt at
	cool ... Kip peers into the 'fridge ...

				KIP
		Not much. I got olives. You like
		olives?
		Kalamata olives rule, I think. Ma likes
		the Calabrese. It's more mellow

	And he brings over a bowl of olives.

				MEMPHIS
		There's certainly a time and a place
		for a mellow olive -

				KIP
		Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking --

	And they nibble on them. Kip bites into one ... And the juice
	stings his cracked lip ... But he disguises his grimace as an
	appreciative nod...

	And for a moment, they nibble olives and drop pits into an
	ashtray... Then:

				MEMPHIS
		So what are you gonna do?

				KIP
		About what?

				MEMPHIS
		"About what?"

				KIP
		About Calitri? No worries, man.
		I'll call him. He's a reasonable
		dude ...

				MEMPHIS
		I can see that -

	And Memphis glances out the window. To the crushed car. Kip
	catches the glance, glances himself, chooses to ignore it.

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		You have everything ... under
		control?

				KIP
		Yeah. He just wants to know I'm
		still on it. He needs reassurance.
		All these big swinging dicks do.
		No worries. I won't let him get
		into our Kool-Aid...

	Kip shrugs ... Picks up another olive... Remembers the pain' of
	the last one... Drops it back in the bowl ... Memphis is staring
	at him, disgusted... Kip feels it ...

				KIP (cont'd)
		What -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		What happened to you?

				KIP
		What?

	And now Memphis gets to his feet ... Paces the place...

				MEMPHIS
		You just got crushed in a car. You're
		bleeding all over your self. And you
		sit there - eating olives and talking
		basketball, as if, at this very
		moment, people weren't plotting
		your demise ...

				KIP
		C'mon, man... My "demise..."
			(chuckles)
		Overreaction

				MEMPHIS
		"Over--"  You know - I can maybe
		understand, since I been gone, you
		taking up this dumb-ass life of
		crime, and for that I can partly
		blame myself. But what is baffling
		to me, is how, since I been gone,
		you've become a complete and total
		moron--

				KIP
		Hey, now -

				MEMPHIS
		He's gonna kill you -- !

				KIP
		I can handle it --

				MEMPHIS
		You can handle it?

				KIP
		I can handle it --

				MEMPHIS
		You can handle it?

				KIP
		I can handle it --

				MEMPHIS
		You?

				KIP
		Me.

				MEMPHIS
		You?

				KIP
		Me...

	Beat ... Hold the look ... Kip shifts in his chair ... Even this
	hurts... He tries to hide the wince ... Memphis goes to the 
	window, looks out at the harbor below... Beat ... Then:

				KIP (cont'd)
		Why? You think you can help me?

	And he turns back to Kip ...

				KIP (cont'd)
		What can you do? You haven't done
		anything in six years but pump gas 
		and go overall shopping. And 
		the cars, they've changed ...
		There's new shit. Computer chip
		keys and sophisticated alarms and
		I don't think, an old guy, could much
		bypass 'em...

				MEMPHIS
		You don't think so, huh?

				KIP
		Not really ... But you know... Maybe
		I'm wrong ...

	And the brothers look at each other ... In the pale glow of the
	TV... For a long beat ... And then we'll CUT TO:

	EXT. LONG BEACH HARBOR - CANNERY / FISH AUCTION - DAY

	A rack of eel and OCTOPUS hung out to dry in the salty sun ...

	Memphis walks with Atley Jackson past the bustling commercial
	fishing hubbub: Portuguese FISHERMEN unloading albacore and
	bluefin from their ship's hold; Greek FISHERMEN emptying mackerel
	and halibut from their nylon trawl nets; their WOMEN gut, clean
	and fillet ...

	As they walk, Atley is selecting FISH from the various MARINERS
	... Who wrap it up for him... He places it in a leather satchel
	... Everyone seems to know him...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Nicolo, how's the yellowtail today?

	An old FISHERMAN, who speaks broken English, wraps up several
	steaks...

				FISHERMAN
		Very nice, Atley. Very nice ...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		You can't get it any fresher than this,
		Memphis ... From the sea to my
		skillet ... Nothing in between...

				MEMPHIS
		What's with the fish thing -- ?

				ATLEY JACKSON
		We can learn something from our Asian
		friends. They smoke a thousand
		cigarettes a day; they're completely
		stressed and overworked; they drink
		like, well ...

				MEMPHIS
		Fish.

				ATLEY JACKSON
		And they still have the lowest rate of
		cancer of anywhere in the world. You
		know why? All they eat is seafood.

				MEMPHIS
		Also, never underestimate the restorative
		powers of "Karaoke."

				ATLEY JACKSON
		I do a poaching number. Six-ounce
		fillets in a saucepan of brine. In
		8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn
		wedding. Plain but flavorful. And
		it's a good way to show off my
		Hollandaise sauce ...

				MEMPHIS
		You have a Hollandaise sauce ?

				ATLEY JACKSON
		I do ...
			(laughs)
		Christ, what happened to us ?

				MEMPHIS
		Speak for yourself, boss I don't
		have a Hollandaise sauce

				ATLEY JACKSON
		No, but you dress like an asshole ...

	They walk...

				MEMPHIS
		I think about that night a lot...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Me, too. Every time I walk...

				MEMPHIS
		How they were just there ... Waiting on
		us ... The fix was definitely in ...

	Nothing from Atley... They walk ... Memphis looks at him.

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Yeah, you know: I just. I just
		never really thanked-you. I meant
		to. I just want you to
		know...

	Memphis nods. Atley shrugs, and selects some halibut
	filets.

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Tell him it's on ...

	Atley looks at him...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Yeah -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and
		them Tell him it's on

	Atley nods...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Any idea how you're gonna go at it?

	Memphis looks at him... Shakes his head... FADE TO BLACK.

	As a SUPER on-screen reads: PART II - BACK TO WRONG

	EXT. OTTO'S AUTO - NIGHT

	The hustle and bustle of a full-service auto restoration
	operation ...

	Dig the 157 Chevy, as an orange diamond tuck and roll with
	orange fur interior is installed... Dig the 153 Corvette
	as its front and rear suspension is replaced with coils
	and airshocks ... Dig the 150 Merc, as its chrome is
	stripped off and the old paint sandblasted and holes
	brazed...

	All under the watchful eye of...

	OTTO HALLIWELL

	Late 60s. A feisty grease-soaked curmudgeon who begs the
	question: how the hell did they manage to rock together
	Yoda and the ghost of Walter Huston... ?

	But he remains the Zen master of cars and all that cars are, were
	and can be ...

	His mixed-breed MUTT - Hemi - licks his balls in one corner

	Otto is currently AIRBRUSHING a candy-colored, variegated DESIGN
	on the deck lid of a Camaro ... It is painstaking work ... But he
	is an artist ...

	His woman - JUNIE - a tall blonde, early 40s, body of a thousand
	dances, wipes his brow, like a scrub nurse ...

	Memphis wanders in...

	Otto sees Memphis ... Drops his brush... He walks over to Memphis
	... Takes him in his arms ... Hugs him close... Actually waltzes
	him a few steps ...

	Memphis is stunned at the transformation this place has gone
	through ...

				OTTO
		Am I dying? Are all the angels of my life
		returning to bid a final farewell?
			(holds him at arm's length)
		And have my angels completely lost
		their fashion sense -- ?
			
				MEMPHIS
		Hello, Otto ...

				OTTO
		You remember Junie?

				MEMPHIS
		Of course. Hi, Junie --

				JUNIE
		Hello, Memphis -

				MEMPHIS
		What happened here -- ?

				OTTO
		Whatever do you mean?

				MEMPHIS
		The chop-shop... Where are the stripped
		cars?  The rolled-back odometers? The
		part bins?

				OTTO
		What happened? Old-age happened. I tired of
		killing them. I woke up one morning and thought
		I am no longer a destroyer. I am a means of
		resurrection. Now. We restore. We revive.
		There are so few things in this life, we can
		prevent from decay. Most must die. These don't
		have to...

	He calls over to the MEXICAN MAN working on the pick-up ...

				OTTO (cont'd)
		It's 3 coats of primer, 12 coats of black
		acrylic lacquer before laying out the
		flames ... And fill the cab top with mylar
		flakes ... They'll sparkle like stars ...
			(turns to Memphis)
		Randall, Randall, Randall ... You look
		splendid ...

				MEMPHIS
		You, too, Otto

	And Otto goes back to the Camaro ... To finish his work...

				OTTO
		I heard rumors you were back. About
		Kip ...

				MEMPHIS
		He's gotten involved --

	Otto looks up frustrated... To Junie

				OTTO (O.S.)
		I can't concentrate. Play something, my
		sweetness; my reason to rise ...

	And Junie hits PLAY on a cassette deck ... And, instantly, ENGINE
	SOUNDS rip from the shop's stereo speakers ... Otto listens, as
	if it were a Mahler symphony...

				OTTO (cont'd)
		The Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona. At Le
		Mans. 1971. The quad-cam V12. Hear
		how they got the engine up?
		Hear those exhaust notes? That's a
		very wide rev range... Here, it
		peaks at 5500 RPM...

	Memphis smiles ... These eccentricities are old hat...

				OTTO (cont'd)
		Raymond Calitri. He's amplified much
		sorrow on these streets ...

				MEMPHIS
		You think it can be done?

				OTTO
		Are you considering a comeback tour?

				MEMPHIS
		Tell me...

				OTTO
		It can be done. Take two days to shop;
		one to prep. I'll offer up my bible
		for a small fee. You also have to
		hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo
		Castlebeck's linkage so much so
		that he's setting up surveillance
		teams on every city block. And
		then get yourself a crew...

				MEMPHIS
		The hard part ...

				OTTO
		"A people is a detour of nature to
		get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then
		to get around them..." Nietzsche said
		that.

				MEMPHIS
		Is he still working here ?

				OTTO
		The old crew. Go find them. I can't
		help you with that. Since I've cleaned
		up the act a bit, they no longer come
		around... A pity how legitimacy makes
		you unpopular -

				MEMPHIS
		I Just don't know how happy they'll be
		to see me

	Otto has finished the Camaro ... He looks at Memphis --

				OTTO
		I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal.
		worst car ever built. Value job.
		Everything broke and I-fixed it.
		A coma car - built to German specs.
		Plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head.
		On a quiet night, you could hear it
		rusting in the garage. But when that
		car was gone, I missed it. If it came
		driving back in here right now,
		there'd be tears and laughter ...

				MEMPHIS
		And the moral of that story is -- ?

				OTTO
		Go to them. They'll be happy to see
		you ... Ahhh...

	And he closes his eyes ... To listen to the Ferrari tape ...

				OTTO (cont'd)
		... 8.8:1 compression...

	We PRE-LAP Simon And Garfunkel's "Baby Driver" and CUT TO:

	Jenny pulls the car over in a lopsided lurch...

				DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
		Put it in PARK. Remember how

	She parks it. He stabs at the side-view mirror ...

		"Objects May Appear Closer

				JENNY
		I'm sorry.

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		You ain't sorry. You're a horrible

	She starts to cry... Donny softens ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
		Aw, c'mon. It's no big deal.

	EXT. PLEASURE CRUISE DRIVING SCHOOL - DAY

	Memphis waits outside ... The Aries K comes crawling toward him.
	Donny gets out of the car ... Sees Memphis ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Damn. Memphis Raines. Long time ...

				MEMPHIS
		How you doing, man?

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		All I get are the Orientals. They can

		Most of 'em are gone. The Dyar Boys are
		doing a nickel at Chino; Henry Santoro
		and Frankie Fish are moving
		weight in Florida; Bill Doolin was
		killed in Denver... Atley
		Jackson's on the gimp and runnin'
		errands for Calitri; The Sphinx
		is still around, I guess ... Then
		of course, there's ...

	His pause is meaningful ...

				MEMPHIS
		Forget that ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Okay. Figure it forgotten. What's this
		about anyways -- ?

	INT. OTTO'S AUTO - NIGHT

	In a wood-panelled back room, around a conference table: Memphis
	and Donny sit... With the list before them...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Most of 'em are late-model...

				MEMPHIS
		That's right. Only 10 exotics ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		We'll have to start beating the
		bushes, find out where they live...

	Otto enters. Giggles...

				OTTO
		Some crew you got ...

				MEMPHIS
		If we put out the word. That we're
		crewing-up, for a one-time-only job...
		What do you think that'll yield?

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		A bunch of strung-out hypes and stick-
		up men. This ain't like the old days,
		Memphis. The profession has lost its..

				OTTO
		Dignity...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Yeah...

				MEMPHIS
		Well, the three of us don't'exactly
		inspire confidence...

	Beat ... Donny examines the list ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Wow! They got Eleanor here -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		I know. Weird, huh -- ?

	The door opens ... One of Otto's WORKERS is there...

				WORKER
		Otto, there's someone here to --

	But they walk past: Kip, Tumbler, Mirror Man, Toby, Freb

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Lookit Kip. All grown up...

				KIP
		Hey, Donny --

				MEMPHIS
		What are you doing here?

				KIP
		Otto called -

	Memphis looks to Otto ... Otto shrugs ...

				OTTO
		You need him...

				MEMPHIS
		No we don't -

				OTTO
		I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis.
		But how are two washed-up thieves
		and an old man supposed to boost
		50 cars in three days...

				MEMPHIS
		His criminal career has officially come
		to a close ...

				OTTO
		The conundrum still applies, of course. The
		purpose of the endeavor is to rescue
		baby brother from imminent
		death and/or a life of crime. However.
		This cannot be successfully
		carried out without baby brother's
		considerable resources, shabby
		though they may be.

	Memphis considers ... He has little choice ...

				MEMPHIS
		We do this. Then. You're finished.
		Then. You're clean

				KIP
		I like how you wallop back in here -
		after four years - and can still get all
		Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...

				MEMPHIS
		You hear me?

				KIP
		I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll
		move to the country. Open a fruit
		stand...

	Memphis looks at him... Shakes his head...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		You guys have any skills at all?

				KIP
		Hell, yeah. Mirror Man here is
		our electronics expert. He's got
		some gadgets you old farts maybe
		never -heard of; Tumbler can drive
		anything with wheels, and some
		things without; Toby's a hacker,
		can do things with a computer, that
		are pretty amazing ...

				MEMPHIS
		How old are you now, Toby?

				TOBY
		Sixteen. But my birthday's in seven
		months ...

	Memphis shakes his head... Sighs ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY 
			(re: Freb)
		What about him?

				KIP
		Freb can order pizzas like nobody's
		business

	Freb starts to Protest ... Shrugs ...

				FREB
		People gotta eat ...

	Memphis looks at all of them ... Sighs...

				MEMPHIS
		Okay, then... Otto?

				OTTO
		In order to succeed, you're going
		to have to go old-school. one night
		boost. Put all your nuts in one basket.
		And...

				TUMBLER
		One night? Are you nuts?

				MEMPHIS
		You got maybe a better plan?

	Tumbler looks to Kip...

				KIP
		You spread it out ... you move around...
		So's they can't touch you... so's they
		don't know... Shadow games and shit
		...

				MEMPHIS
		"Shadow games?"

				KIP
		Shadow games ...

				MEMPHIS
		You spread it out, by the 2nd night,
		the heat are onto you. Know
		something's up. With a one-night boost,
		by the time all the cars are reported
		stolen, your ship's set sail.

	Kip and the others nod... Makes sense ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Go on, Otto -

				OTTO
		We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to
		shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still
		going to need to expand the crew...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		There's no one left ...

				OTTO
		We've got several Italian cars on the list.
		Always tricky, always timeconsuming. So
		we're gonna need a specialist ...

	Memphis looks at him. Because that's what he was afraid of.

				MIRROR MAN 
			(to Otto)
		You know of one -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Yeah. He's knows of one all right.

	So we'll PRE-LAP The Beach Boys' "409" and CUT TO:

	INT. "THE NAUTICAL MILE" SALOON - NIGHT

	A SHOT GLASS, slammed down on a bar by a surly DRUNK... In a
	mariner saloon. Drunken SAILORS and FISHERMAN and NAVY TYPES.
	Sawdust on the floor. Broken beer mirrors. A rough joint...

				DRUNK
		One more, girl -

	The BARTENDER comes over.. . She is a dark-haired, heavily 
	tattooed GIRL, 26, with the faded blue world-weariness of Roy Orbison
	song... Her name is Sara Wayland... And she goes by SWAY. She
	collects the Drunk's empty glass...

				SWAY
		I think you've had enough, Billy...

				DRUNK
		Enough? I haven't even started, girl.
		Gimme another --

				SWAY
		If you leave now, Billy, you can get
		a head-start on waking up in a pool
		of your own vomit...

				DRUNK
		Listen, you little cooze--

	And the Drunk reaches out across the bar, to grab a bottle And
	Sway grabs his hand, twists it ... The Drunk groans in agony ...
	And Sway, still clutching his hand, hops over the bar ... And
	drags the drunk by his twisted hand to the front ... Cries of
	"Attagirl, Sway!" pepper the air ...

	EXT. "THE NAUTICAL MILE" - NIGHT

	Sway tosses him... The Drunk hitting the pavement ...

				SWAY
		Come back when you've learned how to
		drink, Billy --

	And she freezes ... Because standing there, is Memphis ... She
	looks at him ... Shocked is a good place to start ...

				MEMPHIS
		See you're still stealing the sailors from
		the sea --

				SWAY
		What are you doing here?

	And she heads back inside ... And he follows her...

	INT. "THE NAUTICAL MILE"

	They head toward the bar...

				SWAY
			(re: his clothes)
		What's with the look?

				MEMPHIS
		The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting
		old...

				SWAY
		You look like you lost your sheep ...

	And she hops back behind the bar ...

				MEMPHIS
		You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's?

				SWAY
		Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in
		here ...

				MEMPHIS
		Buy you a drink?

				SWAY
		Nope. I got a coffee. And a
		boyfriend.

	She waves to a 30-year-old CAT drinking with his buddies. He waves
	back. Memphis frowns.

				SWAY (cont'd)
		Mitch.

				MEMPHIS
		"Mitch?"

				SWAY
		Mitch.

				MEMPHIS
		So I was replaced by Mitch?

				SWAY
		No. You were replaced by Alex.
		Who was replaced by Kevin. Who
		was replaced by Vince. Who was
		replaced by Mitch...

	She smiles sourly at him...

				MEMPHIS
		Wow. And to think all I
		accomplished these past six
		years was the "LORD OF THE
		RINGS" trilogy...

	She stares at him... Shakes her head... Busies herself with her
	glassware ... Beat ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		You look great --

				SWAY
		Yeah, well, you always were a sucker
		for flawed existences ...

	ANGLE - MITCH. Watching them talk ...

				SWAY (cont'd)
		You should leave --

				MEMPHIS
		On account of Mitch?

				SWAY
		On account of me.

	He studies her... Then:

				MEMPHIS
		I've taken the spear for a lot of
		people, Sway. Including you. Can't
		we improvise a little here ... ?

				SWAY
		No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ...
		You left me, remember?

				MEMPHIS
		I left town. I didn't leave you.

				SWAY
		A distinction worth noting ...

				MEMPHIS
		And here I am...

				SWAY
		Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on
		account of any longing-for-my-touch
		on your part -

				MEMPHIS
		Kip's in trouble

	And now she looks concerned

				SWAY
		What kind of trouble -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks.
		Only the two weeks have turned into four
		days. And not a single lady has been
		snared.

				SWAY
		And you got some Italians -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Six or seven...

				SWAY
		I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't
		for a while. I've carved out something
		for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...

				MEMPHIS
		I understand -

	And the cat - MITCH - comes over with two empty pitchers

				MITCH
		Another round, Sara -

				SWAY
		Sure, Mitch -

	And she goes to the tap ... Leaving Memphis and Mitch ...

				MITCH
		How you doing, pal?

	Memphis nods ... Beat. They sit there. Regard Sway...

				MITCH (cont'd)
		She's hot, right?

				MEMPHIS
		I'd go so far as to say "lovely."

	And Mitch leans over to him, conspiratorially ...

				MITCH
		You should her face when she's having
		sex --

	And Memphis turns to him...

				MEMPHIS
		Really?

				MITCH
		Really...

				MEMPHIS
		What's it look like?

	And Memphis reaches out, and GRABS Mitch's nipple, PINCHING.
	Mitch's face curls ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Is it a squinty, grimacing, contorted
		face? Agonized and writhing and ugly?
		Oh, now I see it, yes, yes!

	And Memphis releases him... And Mitch goes down hard ... And Sway
	comes over ...

				SWAY
		What the hell are you doing -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		If you change your mind. We're at
		Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours.
		For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's
		life on the felt. So long now ...

	And he's out of there, before Mitch's PALS can get to him.

				MITCH
		Who was that guy, Sara?

	She looks at the door ... Shrugs ...

				SWAY
		Good question ...

	INT. OTTO'S AUTO - LATER - NIGHT

	Memphis, Kip, Donny, Mirror Man and Otto sit around the garage ...
	Going through the list ... Tumbler calls from the next room:

				TUMBLER
		Freb's here. Open the gate.

				DONNY ASTRICKY
			(to Otto)
		We sent him out on a solo boost. See
		what he could do ...

	Freb pulls in an '89 Cadillac Coupe De Ville ...

				FREB
		How do I look in this one?

				MIRROR MAN
		Like a goofy white boy in a Cadillac.

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		How'd it go?

				FREB
		Keys were in it ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Well, that defies the point, don't it?

				MIRROR MAN
		You should ask him how he got the name
		"Freb."

				FREB
		Shaddup, man ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Get the damn thing in there and get it
		cleaned up -

	Freb pulls in. Pops the trunk. The gate is closed.

				KIP
		This is loaded with crap - get a duffel.

	He pulls out a set of golf clubs ... Freb brings over a duffel ...
	Mirror Man plucks something from the trunk ...

				MIRROR MAN (cont'd)
		Holy shit ...

	It's a plasticine BAG - full of a WHITE POWDER...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Lemme see that -

	He pierces the skin.. Tastes ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
		Heroin.

				KIP
		No shit?

	And they pull back the trunk tarp ... And there are perhaps TWO
	DOZEN similar smack-filled BAGS ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		There's gotta be a million bucks worth
		here -

				TUMBLER
		We're rich. Goddamn, we're rich!

				MEMPHIS
		Where'd you pick her up?

				FREB
		In front of one of them poker parlors in
		Chinatown ...

				MEMPHIS
		Well, take it back --

				KIP
		Take it back? What do you mean take
		it back? Are you crazy, man?


				MEMPHIS
		Take it back, Freb --

				MIRROR MAN
		Hey, now, Memphis... C'mon, man -

	Donny makes to grab the bag from Mirror Man ... But Mirror Man
	holds on ... They tug back and forth ... The bag DROPS ...
	Splitting on the ground, behind the car. Spilling heroin.

				MIRROR MAN (cont'd)
		Now, see what you--

	But a BANG! BANG! on the front gate, gives them all pause.

				OTTO
		Who is it -- ?

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (O.S.)
		Castlebeck.

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Jesus. The whole damn thing's loaded.

				OTTO
		one minute -- !

	And the others scatter into the back office, with their tools and
	devices and lists. Leaving only Memphis and Otto.

	Memphis picks up the broken bag ... Sticks it in the trunk ...
	Puts the golf clubs in on top of it ... Slams the trunk. Only
	there's still a neat MOUNTAIN OF SMACK ON THE FLOOR by the rear of
	the Caddy ... But there's no time...

	For the gate is opened. Detective Castlebeck ambles in.

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		I know you.

				MEMPHIS
		You know my back.

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		What are you still doing here,
		Randall?

				MEMPHIS
		Stopped by to see Otto. Say hello.

	Castlebeck looks at Otto... Otto grins... Castlebeck walks around
	the garage... Taking it all in...

	Castlebeck notes the Caddy ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		What's this -- ?

				OTTO
		Cadillac.

	ANGLE - the mound of heroin on the floor ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		What's wrong with it -- ?

				OTTO
		Needs brightening ...

	Castlebeck takes out a WALKIE ... Barks into it ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Run me down a tag - 329 HRO. Cadillac.

	He clicks off ... Otto and Memphis share one ... A glance to the
	smack ... Castlebeck is a mere inches from it ...

				OTTO
		No faith in our new-found goodness,
		Detective ...?

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Sure. But sometimes we got to
		create some numbers. The task force
		is run by statistics, you know ...

	Before they can respond, the radio crackles ...

				RADIO (O.S.)
		329 HRO. There's no want on the license at
		this time...

	Castlebeck looks disappointed... Otto grins ... Castlebeck stares
	at the Caddy, still unconvinced...

				MEMPHIS
		You're thinking: okay, there's no want ...
		But they probably stripped its guts and
		crated 'em up, right ... ?

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Something like that -

	Memphis opens the driver's side door ... Gestures Castlebeck in
	... Castlebeck gets behind the wheel ...

				MEMPHIS
		Let her rip ...

	And Castlebeck starts the car...

	ANGLE - TAILPIPE ... WHOOSH! All of the heroin on the flo is blown
	away by the exhaust ... Memphis winks to Otto ... Castlebeck seems
	satisfied ... Gets out.

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Okay, then. I'll catch you later,
		Randall ...

				OTTO
		Double-meaning intended, right?

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Right ...

	Castlebeck stops at the gate... Turns back to them...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		It's funny. There's probably been
		five more cars stolen in the time
		I've been here ...

				MEMPHIS
		I don't think so, Detective ...

	And Castlebeck is gone. Memphis and Otto exhale big time.. The
	others come out from the back... To find Memphis and Otto dumping
	the heroin into the sink, running the tap ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Take her back to where you found her,
		Freb --

	INT. RAINES APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Kip is in front of the TV, playing a video game. Helen Raines is
	at the kitchen table, going through a PHOTO ALBUM... Memphis comes
	home ... Hangs up his coat ...

				MEMPHIS
		Hey -

	He kisses her head ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Kip -

	Kip nods ... Plays on ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		What do you got there?

				HELEN RAINES
		The photo album. I get nostalgic around
		this time of year ...

				MEMPHIS
		What time of year?

				HELEN RAINES
		Tuesdays ...

	He smiles ... Sits down next to her ... They go through the

	PHOTOS: - childhood shots of Memphis and Kip, a younger Helen;
	Memphis at 17, in his "Ike's Garage" coveralls; 14year-old
	Memphis, an infant Kip, and their father (ROBERT RAINES) a MAN
	with bright eyes and a quiet smile, standing before an old Cutlass
	442; Robert Raines ... Outside a car dealership. We can almost
	feel his strong, sure presence ...

	Memphis looks at his mother ... As she looks at the picture.

				MEMPHIS
		You ever wonder what things'd be like
		if he hadn't died?

				HELEN RAINES
		Every day. I wonder about that every day...

				MEMPHIS
		Kip and I'd probably be working at the
		dealership...
			(to Kip)
		Imagine us selling cars?

	Nothing from Kip ... Eyes glued to the TV... Memphis glances to
	his Mother ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Imagine that -- ?

				HELEN RAINES
			(salesman voice)
		And just in case you lose your keys, good
		sir, I can toss in a complimentary slim-jim,
		free of charge ...

				MEMPHIS
		Mother -- !

	They laugh ... Look at the album ... At Robert Raines ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		I remember, every day, he'd come home
		in a different car.
		That was the greatest thing ... And
		we'd climb all over it ... Examine
		every inch of every different
		car ...

				HELEN RAINES
		I remember. Supper getting cold, cos you
		two are out there heads under hoods ...

				MEMPHIS
		You remember that, Kip?

				KIP
		I was six ...

	Memphis and Helen look at him... Then:

				MEMPHIS
		After he died ... I think that's
		what I missed most of all ... That
		there was no different cars every night ...
		When I started hanging around Otto's ...
		And he started showing me the things ...
		It was a way to kill two birds ...
		Put food on the table for you and Kip ...
		And ... Ride in different cars every
		night ... Just like when Dad was here.

	Tears stand in Helen's eyes ... Kip gets to his feet ...

				KIP
		Ancient history's two things.
		"Ancient." And "history!"

	And he walks out of the house, door slamming behind him. Memphis
	turns to his mother ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		We're gonna have to do this thing, Ma.

				HELEN RAINES 
		I know...

				MEMPHIS
		We do it. He'll get clear Once and
		for all 

	And she nods ...

	ANGLE - A PHOTO. Robert Raines. Smiling beside an Olds 98.

	EXT. INTERNATIONAL TOWERS HIGH RISE CONDOS - DAY

	The garage door opens as a resident drives out ... And Memphis and
	Donny and Kip and Toby enter the garage ... They walk along the 
	rows of parked cars ... Searching ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Car-jacking is the lazy man's boost.
		No skill. No finesse. Can only take
		the car if the key is in it. That's
		not thieving. That's parking ...
		Thugs ... With the decency of dirt ...

				TOBY
		They're just cars, man ...

	To prevent Donny from biting the kid's head off, Memphis chimes in
	with:

				MEMPHIS
		This Eleanor's been living at the
		International Towers for 3 years now.

				TOBY
		Who's "Eleanor?"

				MEMPHIS
		The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.

				TOBY
		Why do you call it "Eleanor?"

				MEMPHIS
		All the vehicles get code names.
		Female names. You say "Eleanor lives
		at such and such... " and no one
		listening on the waves is the wiser ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Eleanor is Memphis' "unicorn."

				MEMPHIS
		And there she is --

	Indeed, slotted nearby is a '67 SHELBY MUSTANG GT-500 Silver with
	black top ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Hello, Eleanor --

	And he looks at her. An old friend he hasn't seen in years.

				TOBY
		It looks just like a regular Mustang --

				KIP
		Don't go there, Toby --

				MEMPHIS
		She's not. Carroll Shelby tweaked the
		Mustang's High-Performance 289 engine
		and got it legally rated for the street
		at 450 horsepower ... But its actual
		output is closer to 600 ...

				TOBY
		So she flies -

				MEMPHIS
		She soars -

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Grade-A unicorn ...

				TOBY
		What's a "unicorn?"

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Fabled creature. You know - the horse
		with the horn? Impossible to capture?

	Toby looks blank ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
		We all got one. The single car
		that, no matter how many times
		you try to boost, something happens...
		Cops show up, car doesn't start, owner
		comes back. It's voodoo...

				TOBY
		You guys and the car thing, man --

	They head off ... Memphis turns back to the Shelby

				MEMPHIS
		See you in a few days, Eleanor --

	INT. OTTO'S AUTO - BACK ROOM - DAY

	To Queen's "I'm In Love With My Car." The crew is at work, a MAZDA
	and a CADDY are parked here for practice: Tumbler is modifying a
	series of slim jims, based on the type of cars they'll be after

	Donny and Freb are in the Caddy, Freb behind the wheel Tumbler
	puts together BRIEFCASES, containing the requisite TOOLS: slim-
	jim, gizmo, screwdriver, ratchet, dent-puller, a mini-battery with
	pointy leads ...

	- Mirror Man is showing off one of his GADGETS - beepersized
	DEVICE - to Otto... They stand before a locked MAZDA.

				MIRROR MAN
		And you just stick it in the lock.
		Hit this little button ... And ...

	He does ... The door UNLOCKS ... The car's ALARM gives a weak
	chirp and dies... Otto looks at Donny ...

				OTTO
		We're dinosaurs, Donny. Pull-up a tar pit ...
			(to Mirror Man)
		Can I try -- ?

				MIRROR MAN
		Knock yourself out --

	Kip and Memphis are with Toby, who has his laptop out ...

				TOBY
		I logged outside the G.R.A.B. site,
		right? Then I monitored their
		incoming outside data requests,
		right? Then I got these ISDN numbers,
		right? Then I tracked them back,
		right? Then I took the one I could
		jack-up the easiest, right? Then I
		called back see, they think I'm an
		insurance company - that's where it
		looks like I'm coming from -- and
		they're sharing stats with this
		insurance company, right? So now
		they're sharing it with me, right?
		They think I'm looking for stats for
		an actuarial conference on auto-theft.
		So they let me in, right? Give me all
		these numbers. But then I don't leave,
		right? I'm in. I've got the key. Now I
		just go anywhere I want.

				MEMPHIS
		So what's in there -- ?

				TOBY
		I can tell you who's gonna be on duty
		tonight. I can tell you how much gas
		they're using monthly. I can tell you
		how they used to spend that annoying
		half-hour between "FRIENDS" and "SEINFELD"...

	Memphis nods ... Fairly impressed...

				KIP
		Good work, Toby --

	Donny and Freb are inside the Caddy ... Freb's attempts to start
	it fail...

				FREB
		It just ain't happening --

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		You'll get the hang of it, kid. You
		just need to remember one thing -

				FREB
		What's that?

	Donny smiles ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		On boost night? Always take along a
		good mix tape ...

	Donny smiles ... Freb frowns ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
		You bring a woman back to your
		crib for some lovemaking, the
		song you put on, depends on the
		woman, the type of lovemaking you
		intend to do, right?

				FREB
		I guess ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		You got a school teacher or Nancy from
		accounting, you don't put on Sly Stone
		or James Brown. You put on
		Ravel. Rachmaninoff. But if you got
		some wild one you just picked
		up at the track, you wouldn't put on
		Cat Stevens or James Taylor.
		You'd put on Prince. Or Isaac Hayes.
		Or, if you really wanted to
		get after it: Miles.

				FREB
		okay ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		It's the same way with cars. Different
		cars. Different tunes. You can't steal
		a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You
		gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny
		Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that
		shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman
		Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could
		lead to disaster. Got it... ?

				FREB
			(absolutely hasn't got it)
		Got it ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Good.

	And then Sway enters ... Donny gets out of the Caddy ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
		Whoa, whoa, whoa. Memphis went out
		and got some big game ... Hello, Sway.
		I was just telling the lads about mix
		tapes --

				SWAY
			(to Freb)
		Janis Joplin. Billie Holliday. Ella
		Fitzgerald...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Gender bias ...

	Otto is before her ... Bowing from the waist ...

				OTTO
		I've missed you, Sara Wayland --

				SWAY
		Good to see ya, Otto --

	They embrace. Memphis and Kip enter from the other room...

				KIP
		How ya doing, Sway -- ?

				SWAY
		Kip...

	She looks at Memphis ... Small nod... Small smile ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		What do you think about all this?

				SWAY
		Stick it in the drawer marked "Fool's
		Errand", right -- ?

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		That's my girl --

				MEMPHIS
		That's Mirror Man ... And that's
		Freb ... And Tumbler ... And Toby ...
		Fellas, this is Sara Wayland... They
		call her "Sway."

				SWAY
		Hey -

	But the kids look high near thunderstruck ... The others laugh ...
	Go back to their work ... Memphis and Sway

				SWAY (cont'd)
		No questions. I'm here. I need the
		dough.

				MEMPHIS
		Of course ...

	She studies him... Nods ...

				SWAY
		Good. Just so we understand...

	And then she sees something at the entrance ...

				SWAY (cont'd)
		Oh, shit. You didn't --

	He follows her gaze ... To where -- A MAN, early 40s, has walked
	in. Tall, gaunt, ice-eyed. This man never speaks. And his nose is
	a gnarled blob of scar tissue ... Which is why they call him

	THE SPHINX

	And the others really don't dig his scene ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Well, well, well. The original crash
		test dummy...

	The Sphinx nods to all. Smiles warmly, but it comes out creepy.
	Freb whispers to Otto ...

				FREB
		Who's that -- ?

				OTTO
		That's The Sphinx.

				FREB 
		The Sphinx?

				OTTO
		He never says a word. And he's got
		a messed-up nose. Hence. The Sphinx.
		He's boo-koo koo-koo. But he steals like
		time ...
			(to The Sphinx)
		Hello, Sphinxy, old rum -- !

	And Otto embraces the taller man ... And the others stand
	around, offering uneasy glances to The Sphinx ...

				MEMPHIS
		Okay. We're all here. Today's Wednesday.
		D-Day is Friday night ... That gives us
		two days to prep ... We're going to find
		the ladies on our list, find out where
		they live, when they're home; that
		they're properly insured ... Let's get
		into the vans --

				MIRROR MAN
		Where we going -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		We're going shopping -- !

	We PRE-LAP Gary Numan's new-wave rave classic "Cars".

	EXT. LONG BEACH STREETS - DAY

	A MONTAGE of the hard-core old-school preparations...

	THREE MINI-VANS drive off from Otto's Auto - Mirror Man at the
	wheel of one of them - The Sphinx and Donny with him... - Freb
	drives the 2nd van: Memphis, Sway, and Kip with him... Tumbler
	drives the 3rd van: Otto and Toby with him.

	They carry pens and NOTEBOOKS ... And, as they drive around,
	they're searching out cars ... When they see an auto that
	corresponds to the list, they take down its license plate.

	Memphis dials the cell ... Mirror Man answers on the speaker in
	his van ... Tumbler in his ... We'll CROSS-CUT the scene as
	necessary from van to van ...

				MEMPHIS
		How's it going -- ?

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		It's arright ...

	They drive on ... Till --

				DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
		Check it out: 173 Firebird. Know
		who drove one of those ... ?

				OTTO
		Yes, I do, in fact. John Wayne in
		McO...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		That's being obscurest ... Who else?
		Better known. Memphis?

				MEMPHIS
		Jim Rockford. ROCKFORD FILES.

				MIRROR MAN
		For real?

	As the scenes in the vans play out - we should be INTERCUTTING

	with SHOTS of CARS ON THE STREET. LICENSE PLATES. Their NOTEBOOKS.
	As license #s are written down.

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		For real. Okay. Gimme COLUMBO...

		Remember who my brother is?

	INT. OTTO'S BACK ROOM - DAY

	Donny offers the REGISTRY WOMAN a LIST of several cars from the

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		I can wait.

	He smiles kindly at her. And takes a seat. It's that easy.

	INT. OTTO'S BACK ROOM - DAY

	Sway at the board... A grouping of three Mercedes Benz S320 are

	INT. OTTO'S GARAGE - DAY

	Otto shows Freb how to disarm an alarm system by groundingout a
	tail-light with a wire to a mini-battery...

	This dead-shorts the lights, shorts-out the alarm system, which

	locks pop open ... Otto grins...

	EXT. JIMMY'S HARBORSIDE - NIGHT

	Mirror Man in the Boxster... Parked, . He takes the KEY from
	the ignition ... And then takes, from under his jacket - a KEY

	Shop and talk, part III ...

				FREB
		Okay, okay. What about MAGNUM P.I.?

				KIP
		Thanks for playing, Freb. That's a
		gimme ...

				OTTO
		Yes, but what was on the license
		plate?

				MIRROR MAN
		The license plate?

				TUMBLER
		I know. "ROBIN 1."

				OTTO
		Very good. But what was the
		significance of "ROBIN 1"?

				FREB
		Was that his first name?

				OTTO
		His first name was Thomas. Thomas
		Magnum...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Thomas Sullivan Magnum, to be exact.

	They look at Donny, impressed...

				TUMBLER
		Robin 1 ...

				MIRROR MAN
		I know! Robin was the name of that
		faggy guy who hung with him...

				KIP
		No. That was Higgins ....

	He pays her ... Big smile ...

	INT. THE VANS - MOVING

	One more time ...

				OTTO
		Anyone? The significance of "Robin 1" on
		Magnum's license plate? Memphis?

				MEMPHIS
		Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the
		estate they lived on ...

				OTTO
		Ten points for our fearless leader ...
		Sway, how 'bout giving us the honor of
		the Bill Bixby trifecta -- ?

				SWAY
		I don't know that

				KIP
		Stumped -- !

				FREB
		Thank-God, Sway, you ain't all freaky-
		deaky, too

	But Sway grins

				SWAY
		How about: a Corvette in
		MAGICIAN; a Ford pick-up truck in
		INCREDIZLE HULK, and...

				OTTO
		Here's where it gets tricky ...

				SWAY
		... he walked in THE COURTSHIP OF
		EDDIE'S FATHER.

	Kip high-fives her... Freb looks disappointed...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Walked like a bastard... Skippin'
		stones and shit..

				OTTO
		That's a good one, Donny...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		I think so too --

	And they drive... All smiles ... All pleased with
	themselves ... And, after a beat ...

	INT. BACCHIOCHI'S FOREIGN MOTORS - DAY

	A garage dealing exclusively in imports. Memphis enters...

				MEMPHIS
		Hello -- ?

	Sway slides out from beneath a Testarosa ... In her greasy
	coveralls, hair tied back, a motorhead's dream girl ...

				SWAY
		Hey.

				MEMPHIS
		What's wrong with her -- ?

				SWAY
		The right side of the engine is
		running richer than the left. And the
		scope isn't showing shit... I dunno... 

	And she goes to the sink...

				SWAY (cont'd)
		You know Annie's trouble

				MEMPHIS
		Annie -- ?



				SWAY
		You haven't been studying --

	She gestures to where the LIST of 50 is on the counter.

				SWAY (cont'd)
		137 Roadster. Custom. Lives at 1443
		Locklin in Rancho Palos Verdes ...

				MEMPHIS
		Right. Great car. One of a kind. I
		was looking forward to that boost
		myself 

				SWAY
		She was the only "Annie" you could find?

				MEMPHIS
		They only made a handful. We're lucky
		there's even one living in the area...

				SWAY
		Yeah, well ... She lives with District
		Court Judge Seymour Croft ...

	As she speaks we CUT TO:

	EXT. 1443 LOCKLIN - RANCHO PALOS VERDES - DAY

	A massive house of glass and steel in a fancy
	neighborhood. We MOVE FOR THE HOUSE. Over the fine-trimmed
	lawn.

				SWAY (O.S.)
		... and he keeps "Annie' in his
		living room... Like a work of art ...

	INTO THE SPARTAN LIVING ROOM...

	Massive framed Lichtenstein and Haring pieces on the wall
	... Surround the yellow ROADSTER, which sits up on a
	platform ... Check out JUDGE CROFT, a nasty fat man in his
	late 50s ... He sits in the nearly empty room... A complex
	system of directional lighting illuminates the Roadster
	...

				SWAY (O.S.)
		She's got 27 miles on her o-dom.
		Which is exactly how far away the
		custom shop was in 1979 when he
		bought her... He drove her home,
		never drove her again ...

	The judge gazes at the car, admiring its jet-pod
	taillamps... A MAID comes in with a tray of tea service
	... The maid crosses the Judge's line of sight... Watch
	as he curses her out, his face going beet red with fury...

				SWAY (O.S.)
		The man's a freak...

	INT. BACCHIOCHI'S FOREIGN MOTORS

	Sway looks at Memphis ...

				SWAY
		She's trouble --

				MEMPHIS
		I put the boys on it. They're clever
		that way...

	She nods ... Long look ...

				SWAY
		I go with you --

				MEMPHIS
		That what you want?

				SWAY
		That's what I want ...

				MEMPHIS
		Okay.

	She hits the Lava soap and starts washing the grease from her
	hands ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		I missed you, you know -

				SWAY
		You mentioned that in your letters 

				MEMPHIS
		I always thought you'd follow me up.

	She shuts off the taps ... Towels her hands...

				SWAY
		We were good when you bailed, weren't we?

				MEMPHIS
		Very good...

				SWAY
		Cos there were those dark days, when
		I figured - my God, how easy it was
		for him to just give it up; to make the
		deal; take the rot for the whole crew ...
		And give me up in the process.

				MEMPHIS
		No way ...

				SWAY
		No ... ?

				MEMPHIS
		No ...

	And he holds out a hand to her ... And she puts her greasesmeared
	towel into it ...

				SWAY
		Don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me,
		Randall. I'm the jane that was left, and
		you're the jim that did the leaving. So
		save the sanctimonious shit for someone
		who believes. The only reason I ride with
		you, is cause I don't want to spend the
		whole night with any of them other creeps!

				MEMPHIS
		Oh. Okay. Right.

	EXT. BACCHIOCHI'S FOREIGN MOTORS - DAY

	Memphis walks out... Going over to the PARKED CAR across the
	street ... Castlebeck...

				MEMPHIS
		I'm on the move -

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Your girl works in there ...

				MEMPHIS 
		Not my girl anymore

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Yet your still here ... I gave
		you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...

				MEMPHIS
		What do you want from me?

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Honestly? I want to - once every
		few months - get into my car. Pack
		a lunch. And drive on up to Chino.
		On visiting day. Bring you some
		magazines. Maybe some almond clusters.
		And see you all bright and shiny in
		your orange jumpsuit. That's what I want ...

	And with that, he starts his car ... Drives off... Memphis gazing
	after him...

	INT. VAN - MOVING - NIGHT

	Memphis drives. Kip beside him. They drive in silence. At last
	coming to:

	EXT. TEN-TON TRANSFER COMPANY - FRONT GATES

	A huge trucking company warehouse. Kip gets out. Bolt-cuts the
	chain-fence out front.

	And Memphis drives on in, passing the long rows of gargantuan
	CAR CARRIERS here. He picks one ...

				MEMPHIS
		This one ...

	He slim-jims the door ... But the ALARM goes off ... A wild
	whooping alarm ... Deafening... Try as he might, he can't get it
	off. He pops the trunk. Looks for wires ... Nothing.

	Then, at once, it goes off. Memphis turns. Kip is there. He holds
	a little DEVICE.

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		What's that thing -- ?

				KIP
		Reads the infrared. Then kills it. Little
		something the R & D department came up with ...

				MEMPHIS
		How long were you gonna let me try and
		stop it...?

				KIP
		After a while, it became a little pathetic ...
		Figured I'd put you out of your misery ...

				MEMPHIS
		Thank-you ...

				KIP
		De nada ...

	He gets behind the wheel. Pops the ignition. The truck's flipping
	stack belches. Memphis climbs in next to him.

				MEMPHIS
		Ain't we good-timing here ... ?

				KIP
		The family that steals together, deals
		together...

				MEMPHIS
		Dad'd be proud --

				KIP
		Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...

				MEMPHIS
		What era was that -- ?

				KIP
		The era when crime didn't pay --

				MEMPHIS
		As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?

				KIP
		Price of doing business...

				MEMPHIS
		What about just getting a job, 9 to 5,
		five days a week, that whole mystery
		achievement -- ?

				KIP
		It's for assholes. The Legal Buck blows,
		Memphis.  You know that. Doing this, we
		make mad bank, my boys are down, the
		girlies come around and the boosts are
		a breeze. Yeah, sure, you're gonna get
		jacked-up every now and then - but ain't
		that a small price to pay for never,
		never-ever, having to say "paper or
		plastic?"

	And he grins and puts the truck into gear. And off they go

	INT. OTTO'S AUTO - GARAGE - NIGHT

	The Replacements chime in with "Someone Take The Wheel." Memphis
	and the crew ... All but Sway are present.

	Tumbler and Mirror Man follow Memphis to one side of the shop ...
	To a window ... He gestures outside to where we see and UNMARKED
	CAR and the orange glow of two cigarettes ... Staking them out ...

				MEMPHIS
		We've got to shake them tomorrow
		night. I'm making that your problem.
		That's called delegation of duties.
		You like it -- ?

	Mirror Man and Tumbler regard the cops ...

				MIRROR MAN
		Sure, man --

	And they follow him back into the garage ...

				MEMPHIS
		Okay. Tomorrow night it's on. Each
		team has been assigned their ladies.
		The teams are: me and Sway. Donny
		and Freb. Kip and Tumbler. Mirror
		Man, you and The Sphinx ... 

	Mirror Man looks horrified ...

				MIRROR MAN
		Aw, c'mon, man ...

	The Sphinx grins at him...

				TOBY
		What about me?

				MEMPHIS
		You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto
		abreast of our progress ...

				TOBY 
		How come ... ?

				MEMPHIS
		Because you should be home with
		Nintendo, listening to The Spice
		Girls, little man ...

				TOBY
		Come on. Kip, talk to the guy

				KIP
		There's no talkin' to him --

	And Otto and Junie come out with two bottles of champagne and some
	paper cups ...

				OTTO
			(cup raised)
		To a safe and successful session of bumping
		fenders and trading paint.

	Everyone toasts ... Drinks ... Donny goes to the tape deck... Hits
	PLAY ... And "Little Deuce Coupe" by The Beach Boys BLASTS.
	("Little Deuce Coupe/You don't know what I got...")

	And all of our guys dance to it ... Singing along ... Otto dances 
	with Junie; Tumbler with Toby; even The Sphinx lipsyncs the falsetto
	parts ...

				BEACH BOYS 
		"Well, I'm not braggin,' babe So don't put
		me down But I got the fastest set of wheels
		in town, etc."

	Yes, it's the requisite rock-to-an-oldie bit ... But God, it's
	fun. As they exorcise some pre-boost jitters.  Only Kip stands
	aside from the frolic ... We watch them dance and laugh and sing
	for a bit ...

	And then Atley Jackson is there. And behind him, another Calitri
	GOON... And, finally, Calitri himself stands there.
	Someone kills the music. They all look at him... Donny and The
	Sphinx nod to Atley ...

				CALITRI
		This is how you're spending my time?
		Having a sock hop?

				MEMPHIS
		Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the
		community ...

				CALITRI
		Look at this. A multi-generational gathering
		of scumbags ...

				OTTO
		So saith the God of Scumbags --

				CALITRI
		Hello, Otto. My boys at the dock report no
		cars have yet to be delivered. And there's
		only one more night ...

				OTTO
		Getting nervous, Ray? What happens to you, I
		wonder, if delivery isn't made?

	Calitri ignores him... Looks at Kip ...

				CALITRI
		With all the free time I've had not
		counting cars as they're loaded onto
		my ship, I've managed to sand the
		cedar inside your box, Kip. This 
		will protect you from the anaerobic
		bacteria, that normally thrives in
		an airless; environment. Thus
		prolonging decay ...

	He smiles ... And Kip actually makes a run for him... Only to be
	held back by Tumbler and Donny ...

				MEMPHIS
		Get out of here, Ray --

				CALITRI
		One more night --

				MEMPHIS
		Get out --

				CALITRI
		I hope you know what you're doing. God help
		you if you don't ...

	And with that, he leaves, his goons following. Leaving our

	crew to stare after him ... And then we FADE TO BLACK...

	As a SUPER on-screen reads PART III: SWITCHIN'-TO-GLIDE

				TUMBLER
		Watch and learn, old-timer --

	As Mirror Man points the antennae out the window ... A TOY CAR - a
	1970 HEMI 'CUDA replica ... Radio-operated, the car speeds along
	the curb outside, using parked cars as cover... She really cooks...

				DONNY
		The hell are you doing?

				MIRROR MAN
		Delivering ordnance. Y2K-style.

	ANGLE - THE 'CUDA. As it cruises along. Is stopped by a discarded
	40 oz. empty... But Mirror Man maneuvers and its back on track ...
	At last, parking jammed up to the front, right tire of DRYCOFF AND
	HAWKINGS' UNMARKED.

				TUMBLER
		The Hemi Has Landed --

				DONNY
		Big deal. Now what?

				MIRROR MAN
		What we call: fun and shit.

	And he hits a button on his radio control ... ANGLE - the model
	'Cuda. Wedged in front of the tire. As a quartet of thin steel,
	razor-tipped SPIKES thrust out from the Shaker hood ... A fraction
	away from the tire's skin ... Mirror Man and Tumbler appear
	satisfied ...

	And before the Judge can respond, they've clicked him on hold...

		Where should we put him?

		I got a message. I live at 1443

		Yes. We'll be doing some work out your

		Oh, for God's sake

		For the inconvenience we're also

	EXT. OTTO'S - LATER - DAY

	They all wait, anxious ... Dressed for their night ... And then

	Memphis Raines returns...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		I miss Orville Redenbacher already --

		Okay, okay. The important thing to

		Thief Retirement Home ...

	He uses his screwdriver to REMOVE four rivets on the Mazda's
	Clubbed steering column ... In seconds, the CLUBBED STEERING WHEEL
	IS REMOVED, Club still on it. Memphis pops in the steering wheel

	INT. RAINES APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Helen Raines is rooting through a crowded closet. At last she
	finds what she's looking for ... A small black boxy DEVICE. She

	... Helen sits down ... And listens... Her face clenched with
	worry ...

	EXT. SAN PEDRO WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

	Mirror Man works the thick steel door ... He's got a sledge and
	center punch... He knocks the knob off with the sledge and then
	goes to work with an ELECTRIC DRILL ...

				MIRROR MAN
		This is some state-of-the-art shit,

		floral-print dresses?

				SWAY
		Deodorant.

	And she looks at him... She's really laid the lipstick on
	thick ... But it's oddly effective ...

				MEMPHIS
		Wow. Bozo, the very sexy clown --

	Beat. She looks out the window, throws the following away.

				SWAY
		So, you seeing anybody?

				MEMPHIS
		No. I had a girl. She was great. The
		problem is: great girls come along once
		every ten years. So I gotta wait
		another three years before I can even
		bother to look...

				SWAY
		She was so great, why'd you leave her?

				MEMPHIS
		Her parole officer strongly recommended 
		it ...

	She looks at him... But he's stopped the car... For Kip and
	Tumbler are waiting at the side of the street. They get in.

	EXT. LONG BEACH STREET - NIGHT

	Freb dead-shorts the alarm system, grounding it out on the car's
	own metal surface, just like they taught him... He's in the
	Porsche ... It's just that he can't figure out how to get her
	started ... The passenger door opens ... Donny...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		What's the matter?

				FREB
		It's all microchips and shit ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Yeah?

	He holds up a screwdriver. Jams it in the steering column.

				DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
		I don't care what kind of car
		it is. How fancy; how expensive;

		Hell, yeah... It's a beautiful business ...
			(realizes his gaffe)

	Memphis looks at Sway, shakes his head... Kills the lights ... And
	they pull in to

	EXT. SAN PEDRO WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

	Where Mirror Man is still struggling with the lock, his drills
	and punches, scattered about ...

				MIRROR MAN
		Just give me another --

	only The Sphinx shoves him aside ... Pulls the GUN from his 
	holster and BLANG! blasts open the lock...

	Mirror Man stares at the opened door ...

				MIRROR MAN
		Oh, I get it: old school.

	And Memphis and the others drive up ...

				MEMPHIS
		How's it going?

		It's going fine. The Quiet Riot and me are

	Dark as pitch. Flashlights come on. To reveal

	ROW UPON ROW OF GLEAMING FERRARIS

	Old and new models. Daytonas and Boxers and Dinos and
	Testarossas. There must be at least fifty of them here.

	Flashlight beams dance over car after car. It's a treasure chest
	of automotive jewels ... All of our heroes are in awe. And then a
	soft whimpering. They turn. To see Sway, overcome with emotion.

				SWAY
		It's just... so... beautiful ...

	And it is Kip that puts an arm around her ... She sobs into his
	chest ... Never taking her eyes from the array of Italian grace
	... Indeed, they are all in something of trance. Memphis is the
	first one out --

				MEMPHIS
		C'mon, gang. Let's focus. Sway, can
		you prep 'em -- ?

				SWAY
		I think so... They're just... So ...

				MEMPHIS
		I know. But let's prep 'em. We could

	The others are still gazing ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Let's go, people --

	And they set to work...

	EXT. NIGHT CLUB PARKING LOT - NIGHT

	Donny Astricky and Freb have accessed a '61 Jag... Watch as Donny
	takes out 3 screws in the Jag's ignition and removes the whole
	thing ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		So? Tell me: how come they call you
		"Freb" anyways -- ?

				FREB
		C'mon, man ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		We're partners here --

	Freb considers ... Then, reluctantly --

				FREB
		My names "Fred." You know: Frederick?
		One drunk night, I decided to give
		myself a tattoo. Hot needle it. I
		used a mirror to guide me ...

	And he pulls up his sleeve - to show the blue "FREB" tattooed
	there ...

				FREB (cont'd)
		The mirror messed me up with the "b" and
		the "d"... Everything's reversed, you
		know? Now, I'm "Freb."

	Donny chooses from a selection of IGNITIONS he's brought along.
	Finds the right one ... Installs it ... Tightens the 3 screws ...
	Starts the car with his own key ...

		Too early to tell. Nervous?

				KIP
		Nah.

				MEMPHIS
		That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous.
		Everyone's nervous. But not you...

				KIP
		I dunno. Whatever will be will be...

				MEMPHIS
		That's a good attitude, Kip. For

		This shit's on point. Check it: 200.

	He gestures to the speedometer ... Calibrated to 200 MPH..

		That's what I'm talkin' about -- !

	He boogies down. The Sphinx is bewitched, awed by the car's
	magnificent power. But then Mirror Man SCREAMS -- ! With pure
	terror. For, at his feet, wrapped around his legs, is

	A BOA CONSTRICTOR - some 8-feet long... A mass of heavilykeeled
	scales shimmering on coiled muscle ... Mirror Man screams on and 
	on...

	The Sphinx swerves wildly... Racing through a red light. Barely
	missing an on-coming BUS ... Passing a pair of COPS coming out of
	a 7-11. They hop into their unit. Give chase.

		What about you?

	She looks at him... Shrugs...

				SWAY
		You remember my Gramma? Yeah. I was
		thinking. If she were alive. And she
		asked me. If she came down, right now.
		Asked me. "What do you do, Sara?
		What's your life?" Innocently.
		Nonjudgemental. I think it would break
		her heart if I said I was a thief. I
		steal cars, Gramma. And even though,
		hey, I learned it all from her son.
		My Uncle Eddie. Who taught me the basics. 
		Which you refined. (You remember Randall,
		Gramma? You thought he was neat. Well,

		But ... That said... Car thieves are my

		wear a dress maybe once in a while... Maybe
		have a kid... Watch a lot of Audrey Hepburn
		movies.. And think about my Gramma without
		also thinking "shame on me. Shame on

		Know not to get on it ... Momentum

		Up.

	Back arched... A small moan escapes her ... Prince wails ... And
	Sway has achieved whatever kind of silly climax they aspired to
	here... She flops back down... Looks at him...

				SWAY
		You're still quite the boost, Randall
		Raines ...
			(he shrugs)
		Except now I've been chopped, and my

	The Sphinx leans over... And PINCHES THE SNAKE BEHIND THE BACK OF

	7) Kip and Tumbler return to The Viper. This time, in a RAMP

	it, to be disarmed at a later, safer venue as it continues its
	robotic exhortation of "WARNING. YOU ARE TOO CLOSE TO THE

	Where "Annie" the 137 Roadster lives as an objet d'art.
	FIGURES in the thicket surrounding the property. Memphis,
	Sway, Kip, Tumbler, Mirror Man, The Sphinx...

	Mirror Man has the mansion's ELECTRICAL BOX opened... He' going
	through the wires ... Cutting alarm, phone, etc.

	Memphis is on the cell phone... Face grim... He hangs up.

				MEMPHIS
		Donny got shot ... A jacker ...

				SWAY
		How is he -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		They got him to the hospital. He's stable ...

	Beat ... As they all reflect on this...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		On a brighter note: 47 ladies have
		checked in for their South American
		sea cruise -

	This cheers them slightly. Until, from the electrical box:

				MIRROR MAN
		Got it -- !

	And the few remaining lights of 1443 flicker and fade ... They
	regard the house for a beat ...

				SWAY
		Now what -- ?

	No one's quite sure ... They look at the house ... At all that
	glass ... Then Kip walks to their car ...

				KIP
		Pop the trunk, Tumbler.

				TUMBLER
		What for -- ?

				KIP
		I gotta get my tool --

	And Tumbler and Mirror Man look at each other ...

				MIRROR MAN
		No way, homes ...

	Too late. The trunk is popped. Kip reaches in. Comes up with, yes,
	another BRICK ... And Kip walks toward the house. Toward the vast
	windows ...

				MIRROR MAN (cont'd)
			(to Memphis)
		Ya' gotta stop him, man --

	But Kip forges on, indomitable ... Only he passes the huge glass
	windows ... Walking, instead, up to the front door ... And he
	SMASHES the brick down onto the DOORKNOB. Knocking it clean off...
	Looks back at the others with a wink. And enters the house...
	Tumbler runs after him...

	INT. 1443 LOCKLIN

	Kip walks through the dark house ... At last, coming to the living
	room... To "Annie'. He gets behind the wheel ... Her ignition is
	quick work. He's got her started, loud, in the quiet house. She
	coughs a bit; it's been a long time. Tumbler is there...

				TUMBLER
		Now what -- ?

				KIP
		Now, we go -

	And he drives her off the platform. Tumbler directs him...

				TUMBLER
		This way... This way... This...

	Her nose bumps a zillion-dollar VASE, which topples and shatters...

				TUMBLER (cont'd)
		That way...

	And Tumbler climbs in beside him... Kip drives her around the huge
	living room... And Kip punches the gas ...

	And they drive the Roadster down the hall ... And right through
	the OPEN DOOR... Driving down onto the lawn ... Up to their
	cohorts ...

				KIP
		See ya back at the ranch, kids -- !

	And off they go ... Vanishing down the street ... The others watch
	after him ... Mirror Man to Memphis:

				MIRROR MAN
		Gotta tell ya, man: since you been back?
		You've had a real calming influence on
		ol' Kip...

	INT. G.R.A.B. TASK FORCE OFFICE - NIGHT

		How is he?

				DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
		He'll live. But it means your boy's
		behind it. Astricky was holding a list.
		They just faxed it to us...

	He hands Castlebeck the list. Calitri's 50. Castlebeck notes the
	last entry...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Let's get out there. And have them
		run down every 167 Shelby Mustang in
		the area ... Find out where they're at.

				DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
		What for?

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		You spend enough time down a man's
		throat, you get to know his tonsils.
		Do it ...

	INT. WAREHOUSE - LONG BEACH HARBOR - NIGHT

	Kip and Tumbler deliver the Roadster. Toby checks it in.

		Any more, O -- ?

				OTTO (O.S.)

		in the suburbs ...

				KIP
		We'll take it...

				OTTO (O.S.)
		It's ear-marked for Mirror Man and The
		Sphinx...

				KIP
		We'll take it.

	And they climb in behind a waiting Jeep Cherokee ...

				KIP (cont'd)
		Later, Toby --

	But Toby's not around...

				KIP (cont'd)
		Toby?

	No answer... Kip shrugs... And off they go ...

	EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - CHESTNUT HILL - NIGHT

	A nice neighborhood... Upper middle class ... So damn suburban you
	can practically smell the gas grills ... A NEIGHBORHOOD SECURITY
	PATROL CAR glides by them...

				TUMBLER
		Gettin' fancy... Got their own palace
		guard -

	When, from the back of the Jeep:

				TOBY
		I never been to the suburbs ...

	Toby is there ... Having stowed-away...

				TUMBLER
		What are you doing here, assface?

				TOBY
		Checkin' it out

	He smiles at Kip ... Kip looks at Tumbler ... Drives ... At last,
	pulling up to one HOUSE where the '98 Benz - "'Carol" lives. Kip
	parks, a half block down ... They get out ... Head for the
	house...

	And there she is. "Carol." Obsidian black. In the
	garage. The garage is open. And THREE KIDS, two boys and a
	girl. Late teens. They are standing around "Carol"...
	Drinking beer... Listening to the new Beck album on the
	car's CD player ... The folks clearly out of town ...

	Well-scrubbed, white suburban children of plenty ... The only crew
	they've ever run in is J. Crew... From the hedge, Kip, Tumbler and
	Toby watch the kids ... With equal parts fascination, loathing,
	envy... And then, the kids go inside... Leaving "Carol" exposed...

				TOBY
		I got this one...

	And before the others can respond, he moves for her. And she's
	open... Toby's in ... Butterfly popped - Gizmo in. The others start
	to get in when ONE OF THE KIDS comes out from the house. He stares
	at Toby, who freezes mid-boost ...

				KIP (cont'd)
			(whispered hiss)
		Get her started, man -- !

	And Toby does... And slams her in reverse.  And they're off

	INT. WAREHOUSE -LONG BEACH HARBOR - NIGHT

	The group - - Memphis, Sway, Freb, Mirror Man, and The Sphinx

		C'mon, Kip -

	EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREETS - "CAROL" - MOVING - NIGHT

	Toby drives them out, Kip shotgun, Tumbler in the back. But the
	suburbs are confusing. They can't find their way out.

				TOBY
		Which way's out, man -- ?

				TUMBLER
		Shit all looks the same here --

	They drive. Only up ahead, blocking the street, LIGHTS blinding...
	Are TWO SECURITY PATROL CARS - SECURITY COPS on the strong ...
	Guns drawn...

				KIP
		Shit ...

				TUMBLER
		Run it...

	Toby looks to Kip...

				KIP
		No...

				TOBY
		What am I supposed to do?

	Toby pins the gas. Straight at the block... The security cops dive
	out of the way. Except for one standing tall and FIRING into the
	windshield... Into Toby... The car swerves. Going off the road.
	Into a bank of mailboxes.

	The security guards run for her... Kip, forehead bloodied,
	switches places with Toby, getting behind the wheel ... Punches
	the gas ... Getting them out of there ...

	INT. "CAROL" - MOVING - NIGHT

	Kip drives like a wild man ... Toby is bleeding something fierce...
	Shot in the chest...

				TOBY
		Jesus, Kip ... I'm shot, man ...

				KIP
		Just hold on... Hold on ...

				TUMBLER
		What are we gonna do -- ?

				KIP
		Hospital.

				TUMBLER
		We can't do that, dude --

	Kip looks at Tumbler ... They both look at Toby...

	EXT. WAREHOUSE -LONG BEACH HARBOR - NIGHT

	As the 'Vette comes screaming into the warehouse ... Kip exploding
	out of it ... Getting into the back. Memphis goes to the car, sees
	Toby ... Front of his shirt covered in blood ... The others gather
	around...

				MIRROR MAN
		Jesus ...

	Memphis climbs into the car ... Kip is holding Toby...

				KIP
		I didn't know... Should we take him to
		a hospital? I didn't know. I didn't.

	Toby is clearly dying in Kip's arms...

				TOBY
		Kip. Kip. Kip. Tell me: what's
		gonna happen? What's gonna happen?

	But Kip is lost ... Doesn't know what to say --

				MEMPHIS
		You're gonna be okay, Toby... You are ...
		We'll getcha fixed up...

				TOBY
		No ... No... No ... Tell me what's
		gonna happen? Kip? Tell me. What's
		gonna happen?

	The brothers stare at the boy... Kip wipes his sweatstreaked face...

				TOBY (cont'd)
		What's gonna happen? I don't feel ...
		like ... this ... should.... happen ...
		right ... now. I...haven't... done ...
		shit... Tears running down his eyes...

				KIP
		Shhhhhh, shhhhh ...

	Kip looks to his brother for help ...

				MEMPHIS
		Call 911 -

				MIRROR MAN
		Call 'em here -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		DO IT! NOW -- !

	And Mirror Man scurries for the phone... Toby's breathing comes
	out in short staccato bursts ...

				TOBY
		Kip... Kip... Kip... It doesn't
		feel... It doesn't feel... It doesn't
		feel... good

	He looks up at Kip. All of the light goes out of his eyes. And
	Toby is dead... Kip holds him for a beat ... Then passes him to a
	surprisingly emotional Tumbler ... Kip gets out of the car, runs
	for the opposite end of the warehouse ...

	The others are stunned... Mirror Man hangs up the phone ...
	Memphis gets out of the car ... He goes after Kip ... Finds him in
	one of the containers ... Grabs him by the collars ...

				MEMPHIS
		What did I tell you? What? What did
		I tell you?

				KIP
		I don't know. What -- ?

	And Kip looks at him... Tears fall from the younger boy's eyes ...
	And Kip looks so lost ... So like a little kid...

				MEMPHIS
		Come here --

				KIP
		What?

				MEMPHIS
		Come here -

				KIP
		What?

				MEMPHIS
		Come here -

	And Kip does ... He walks to Memphis ... And Memphis puts his arms
	around him... And that's it. The floodgates open. Kip begins to
	sob. Deep, painful, racking sobs. And then:

				KIP
		I've missed you, man ...

				MEMPHIS
		I know. I've missed you, too 

	And they hold each other ...

				KIP
		Toby...

				MEMPHIS
		I know ...

				KIP
		Toby...

	And they stay in the embrace... And then Memphis unwraps Kip's
	arms from around him...

				MEMPHIS
		Stay here. Stay here a while. I'll
		be back ...

	Kip nods, sniffles ... Memphis walks out of the container ... He
	strides up to the others ... Glances at Toby's clipboard, with all
	the cars crossed-out ... He goes to Sway...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Give me a ride -- ?

				SWAY
		Where to -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Kip's not clear yet. We got one more
		to go --

	And she nods ... And climbs into one of the Escorts... And off

	The sun just starting to take all the purple from the night ...

	Sway pulls up a few blocks away ... Memphis has put on a fake
	moustache, wig, necktie ...

				SWAY
		You okay -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Yeah ... You -- ?

	She nods ... He looks at her ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		You should know: walking away from my

	And she smiles sadly ...

		Hey, now -- !

	He pins it ... And THE RACE IS ON... In the biggest way possible.
	This is the grand-daddy of chase scenes here, so we won't take the
	easy way out. We'll actually script it ... Memphis races out onto
	the busy street, Drycoff on his ass.

	Drycoff pulls up alongside him... So they can see him. But the wig
	and moustache prevent them from recognizing Memphis ... Other cars
	suffer from the pursuit ... They go careening into parked cars,
	storefronts, Harvard Square ...

	Memphis side-swipes Drycoff's car ... Memphis drives down the

	entering the workshop... Calitri glances to the wallclock: 7:55
	AM...

				CALITRI
		Well, well. You've caused quite a ruckus ...

				MEMPHIS
		This is number 50. We did it. It's
		over Where's the money ?

				CALITRI
		Right there -

	He gestures to a Haliburton case ... Memphis opens it ... There's
	a lot of cash inside...

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		200 K. Just like we said ...

				MEMPHIS
		You should never have gotten my brother and
		his friends involved ...

				CALITRI
		But I had to. It was the only way to
		get to you --

	Memphis looks at him... Calitri smiles ...

				MEMPHIS 
		Well, now, he's clear. And you'll stay away
		from him...

				CALITRI
		I don't know about that, Randall.
		He did such a good job on this paper.
		And another one just came in ...

	Calitri goes to the FAX machine... Tears off the sheet..

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		It's an easier take. 30 cars. Two
		weeks. Most of them SUVs. Going to
		Russia. Think Kip'll be interested?

				MEMPHIS
		You don't want to even sniff at that --

	Calitri grins. But then his smile goes south, as he sees, for the
	first time -- ELEANOR -- parked out on the loading dock. And she
	is smashed-to-shit.

				CALITRI
		Well, that certainly won't do.

				MEMPHIS
		What do you mean -- ?

				CALITRI
		Look at it. I can't very well make
		delivery of that thing ...

				MEMPHIS
		You got no choice. It's over.

				CALITRI
		Fifty cars. Fifty cars by 8 AM
		Friday. Or Kip goes in that box.
		That was the deal ... Goddamn, it ...
		That was the deal ...

	Memphis is by a TABLE SAW... He flicks it on. The electric MOTOR
	rumbles, so as to obfuscate, any noise in here ...

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		What are you doing -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Tell you what I'm not doing: I'm not
		gonna let you get into my Kool Aid...

	And Memphis is on him... They go rolling about in grunts and
	groans - eddies of sawdust swirling - the NOISE of the table saw
	drowning out the sounds of combat ...

	Calitri is on top, grabbing an AWL from the floor, bringing the
	lethal point down to Memphis' face... Memphis holds Calitri's
	wrist, straining, the point inches from his eye

	ANGLE - FLOOR SOCKET - right above Memphis' head. With a last
	gasp, Memphis misdirects the awl so it STABS THE FLOOR SOCKET - a
	small CLAP OF VOLTAGE shaking through their bodies, as they sprawl
	akimbo ...

	Both men are momentarily paralyzed as the electricity sorts itself
	out inside of them... Calitri is up; and he's found the gun ...

	He crawls over to Memphis, climbing on him, sitting down hard on
	the younger man's chest ... But then Memphis grabs him by the hair
	and tosses Calitri off him ... Memphis POUNDS Calitri's head into
	the floor ...

	Once, twice. Three times. Calitri is out ... Memphis gets to his
	feet, nose bloody. He catches his breath. Only the door opens ...
	And Atley is there ...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Jesus, man ... What'd you do?

				MEMPHIS
		My version of "take this job and shove
		it..."

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Are you crazy? You throw down with The
		Carpenter? You got a grudge against
		your life?

	But before Memphis can respond, there are APPROACHING ENGINE
	SOUNDS from up the alleyway -- as A PANEL VAN arrives. Memphis and
	Atley look at the wall-clock. 8:05. A glance to the unconscious
	Calitri ...

				ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd)
		Now you done it. And with you
		gone - who'll save Kip the next
		time ... ?

				MEMPHIS
		This is all about there not being
		a next time, Atley --

	And the two men hold the look... And the van doors slam, as Digger
	and Butz, Calitri's grave-diggers, get out ... Atley goes to the
	unconscious Calitri ... And he picks him up, straining under the
	dead weight ... Dragging the don over to

	THE OPEN CASKET - One final burst of strength and Atley drops
	Calitri into the casket... Slamming the swell top lid of the
	coffin. He turns to look at the shocked Memphis -- As Digger and
	Butz are there -

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Hello, boys -- !

				DIGGER
		Hey! What happened? Did they make it

				ATLEY JACKSON
		They did not. A tragedy.

				DIGGER
		Mr. C. around?

				ATLEY JACKSON
		He's napping. He said to take it away...

	Atley gestures to the coffin. And they pick it up, move it to the
	van...

				DIGGER
		That'll do ya. Tell Mr. C. we was by.

				MEMPHIS
		Absolutely.

	And they are gone ... And Atley turns to Memphis

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead, right?

				MEMPHIS
		Point-five ...

	And he holds out his hand ... And they shake ...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Get outta here, Memphis --

	And Memphis does ... Nods to Atley...

				MEMPHIS
		Thank you...

	Atley nods ... Memphis walks out to the loading dock... Atley
	watches him go ...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Hoo-boy.

	EXT. CALITRI'S WORKSHOP - LOADING DOCK

	Memphis walks to the battered Eleanor ... As Pearl Jam's
	"Rearviewmirror' crunches and a CAR comes motoring up to him. It's
	ANOTHER 167 SHELBY. ANOTHER ELEANOR, a "For Sale" sign pasted on
	the back window. It's being driven by Kip...

				MEMPHIS
		What are you doing here?

				KIP
		I saw her get smashed-up on the TV.
		Knew there was no way he was gonna
		accept her ...

				MEMPHIS
		Where'd you find this one?

				KIP
		Ya gotta keep tabs on your "Eleanors",
		Memphis. Cos you never know when
		you're gonna need one --

				MEMPHIS
		You boost her -- ?

				KIP
		Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn.

				MEMPHIS
		Move over ...

	Kip does. Memphis gets behind the wheel. Drives...

	EXT. LONG BEACH BOULEVARD - DAY

	Memphis drives... Kip beside him...

				MEMPHIS
		You okay -- ?

				KIP
		I dunno ... I keep thinking about
		him.

	Memphis nods. But then FLASHING LIGHTS behind them ... An UNMARKED
	with Code 3 capabilities - lights & sirens ... Memphis considers
	... He could make another run ... But the looks at Kip... Enough
	is enough ... He pulls over ...

				KIP (cont'd)
		What are you doing? You can outrun
		him...

				MEMPHIS
		It's over. The dumb shit is over ...

	The unmarked pulls up behind him... The cop comes over ... It is,
	of course, Detective Castlebeck.

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		I know you.

				MEMPHIS
		You know my back.

	Castlebeck opens his coat... Showing stuffed holster ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		It's finished, Randall. Get out of
		the car... You, too, kid...

	Memphis starts to get out. When Castleback's RADIO crackles.

				RADIO (O.S.)
		We have suspect vehicle matching description
		at the Woodburn Scrap and Metal ... Repeat:
		the suspect vehicle has just been
		apprehended at the Woodburn Scrap and Metal,
		190 Street and Campanza ...

	Castlebeck frowns, goes to his radio. Memphis looks at Kip.

				KIP
		I reported it ...

	Memphis is impressed...

				MEMPHIS
		Not bad

	ANGLE - CASTLEBECK at his car, on the radio ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Dispatch, what's the license on
		the suspect vehicle... ?

				RADIO (O.S.)
		License is California 6-1-4 HSO. Repeat:
		California. 6-1-4 Henry Sam Ocean.

	And Castlebeck looks at the license on this Eleanor... A vanity
	plate that says - MY 67 ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		10-4.

	And he goes back over to Memphis ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (cont'd)
		Looks like we live to fight another
		round. You're free to go ...

	Memphis can barely believe it. Castlebeck leans down, to Kip:

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (cont'd)
		Your brother's a clever man and a
		talented thief, Kipling. But as role
		models go, you should observe the man,
		not the thief ...

				KIP
		Yes, sir ...

	Castlebeck sighs...

				MEMPHIS
		Don't look so glum, Detective. It's a
		beautiful day, the birds are singing,
		and there's a container ship on
		Pier 14, that's guaranteed to bring you glee ...

	Castlebeck nods ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		I want you gone, Randall. Settle your
		affairs. Make it right with those you
		love. Hell, take 'em with you. But I
		want you out of here. Out of here for
		good this time ...

				MEMPHIS
		Consider me gone, Detective --

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		I'll catch you later, Randall --

				MEMPHIS
		Double-meaning intended --

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		You betcha --

	And Memphis races off ...

	EXT. OTTO'S SALVAGE - DAY

	Otto, The Sphinx, Tumbler, Freb and Mirror Man are sipping coffee
	and eating donuts ... They are exhausted... Memphis and Kip pull
	up in Eleanor... He hands Otto the briefcase. Otto opens it... All
	that cash...

				MEMPHIS
		Split it up. Any word on Donny?

				OTTO
		He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.

				MEMPHIS
		What happened to Sway?

				OTTO
		She left...

	He nods ... The boys are huddled together...

				MIRROR MAN
		Poor Toby, man...

	A few beats of silence as they remember; then shockingly:

				THE SPHINX 
		If his premature demise has, in some way,
		enlightened the rest of you as to the
		grim finish below the glossy veneer of
		criminal life, and inspired you to change
		your ways, then his death carries with it
		an inherent nobility. And a supreme
		glory. We should all be so fortunate.
		You can say 'Poor Toby." I say: "Poor us.."

	They all stare at him, stunned...

				FREB
		You spoke

	The Sphinx shrugs...

				TUMBLER
		Say something else, man

	But The Sphinx lapses back into his silence ... Nibbles a donut
	... Sips coffee ... Memphis smiles ... He takes a stack of bills
	from the briefcase... To Kip:

				MEMPHIS
		You remember where you got this
		Eleanor -- ?

				KIP
		Sure, man --

				MEMPHIS
		She's for sale. They're asking forty thousand.
		Give 'em sixty ...

	And he hands Kip the cash ...

				KIP
		You want me to buy her?

				MEMPHIS
		Shocking, huh? We're clear now. It's done.
		I've never actually paid for a car. I want
		to see what it feels like

	Kip nods ... Memphis looks at a grinning Otto ...

				OTTO
		Dinosaurs. All of us. The Ice Age is
		now...

				MEMPHIS
		I'll see you soon --

				KIP
		Where you off to -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Thought I'd go for a ride -

	He smiles. The others do, too. Memphis heads for Eleanor.

				KIP
		Hey, Memphis -- ?

	Memphis turns back...

				KIP (cont'd)
		I'll see you, right?

	Memphis nods ...

				MEMPHIS
		You'll see me ...

	And we PRE-LAP Sammy John's "Chevy Van" and CUT TO:

	INT. BACCHIOCHI'S FOREIGN MOTORS - DAY

	Sway, underneath a Daytona... We only see her from the waist down
	... Hands on her waist ... Pulls her gently out. Memphis. He
	brings her to her feet ...

				SWAY
		What are you doing... ?

				MEMPHIS
		Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?

	And he uses a rag to tenderly wipe a small black smear of oil from
	her cheek...

				SWAY
		I can't. I got a back load of repairs
		and one of the mechanics called in
		sick and I haven't slept and--
			(stops short; sees the new Eleanor
			outside)
		Where to -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		I dunno. I know a place.

	She looks at him... Long and hard...

				SWAY
		This time it's for real?

				MEMPHIS
		Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.

	EXT. BACCHIOCHI'S - DAY

	And Memphis opens the passenger door for her ... And she gets
	in... And she smiles ... And Memphis climbs behind the wheel. He
	neutral-drops Eleanor, chirping off ...

	EXT. CONTAINER SHIP - LONG BEACH HARBOR - DAY

	As two TUGS guide the giant freighter away from the docks ... All
	those containers ... Filled with cars ... But here comes a COAST
	GUARD CUTTER ... Churning for the ship ...

	Detectives Castlebeck and Drycoff on the deck ... Stopping this
	one cold...

	EXT. LANDFILL - RHODE ISLAND - DAY

	A vast expanse of trash and garbage and layers of earth. Deserted,
	except for THE PANEL VAN parked dead center. Digger and Butz slide
	the casket from the van, parked before an ALREADY DUG GRAVE.

	As they move the casket, a KNOCKING from inside. A POUNDING. And
	muffled CRIES. Digger and Butz exchange a horrified glance... They
	stare at the casket, spooked.

				BUTZ
		Do you believe this?

				DIGGER
		What should we do?

				BUTZ
		We gotta do what we gotta do --

				DIGGER
		Shit. I hate the screamers, man. Why
		can't he finish the freakin' job?

				BUTZ
		Forget about it. Occupational hazard,
		Digger. C'mon...

	And just as we think they're sure to open it -- they DROP THE
	CASKET INTO THE HOLE -- !

	And begin to dump shovelfuls of earth upon it; its unseen occupant
	thumping and pounding and yelling -- And soon the casket is
	covered in dirt. Gone.

	And we PRE-LAP The Turtles' pop gem "Eleanor" ("You got a thing
	about you/I just can't live without you/I really want
	you/ Eleanor near me...")  CUT TO:

	EXT. THE 405 FREEWAY NORTH - ELEANOR - MOVING - DAY

	Memphis driving. Sway riding shotgun. Long Beach at their backs
	... Memphis looks quite enthralled behind the wheel... He loves
	driving this car. Sway watches him. He feels it --

				MEMPHIS
		What -- ?

				SWAY
		Nothing. Just that if I was less
		secure, I might think you were more
		into Eleanor than you are me...

				MEMPHIS
		She does have one thing you don't.

				SWAY
		What's that?

				MEMPHIS
		Bench seats.

	And he grins ... Pats the seat beside him... And Sway slides
	close... He throws his arm around her ...

	And off they go ... As The Turtles' ("Eleanor/Gee, I think you're
	swell/And you really do me well/You're my pride and joy, etc.")
	SING ON... And we hear:

				MEMPHIS (O.S.)
		You like bingo -- ?

	And Eleanor drives away from us ... Into the searing horizon line
	... Becoming just another single, yellow dot in the pointillist
	pattern that is the American road.

	THE END
GONE IN 60 SECONDS 
	by Scott Rosenberg
	4/6/99


	"I wonder," Toad said to himself presently, "I wonder
	if this sort of car starts easily?"
		Next moment, hardly knowing how it came about, he
	found that he had hold of the handle and was turning
	it. As the familiar sound broke forth, the old
	passion seized on Toad and completely mastered him,
	body and soul ... He increased his pace, and as the
	car devoured the street, he was only conscious
	that he was Toad once more, Toad at his best and
	highest. And he sped he knew not whither, fulfilling
	his instincts, living his hour, reckless of what
	might come to him... "

	-- Kenneth Grahame, "THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS"







	"All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty
	hood... "

	-- Bruce Springsteen, "THUNDER ROAD"









	FADE IN:

	EXT. LONG BEACH STREET - LOWER GRAND - NIGHT

	The streets are empty. Low fog skims the sidewalks below a gray stew
	of a sky. It's slightly fuzzy, slightly surreal.  The vast Port of Los
	Angeles is visible in the b.g... No cars parked here ... No cars
	except -

	A '67 SHELBY MUSTANG GT-500

	Silver with deep grill, its sculptured side panels ending in air
	scoops ... All cock and balls, it stands alone in the lonely cool
	before dawn ... An old-school totem to speed and style... And then
	SOMEONE approaches...

	Through the mists of morning ... In leather coat and jack boots ...
	He's early 30s, with the vaguely whimsical confidence of a shimmer
	that refuses to fade ...

	This is RANDALL RAINES, whom they call MEMPHIS - though know one's
	quite sure why ... But they do know he's the auto-boost in Southern
	California ...

	Memphis approaches the Mustang with a gathering awe ... Like a desert
	crash survivor coming upon an oasis ... He walks around it ...
	Admiring it ... Adoring it ...

	But then a FIREBIRD pulls up alongside him. Its driver -
	ATLEY JACKSON, early 30s, handsome, jocular leans out for:

				ATLEY JACKSON
		You gonna steal her or kneel down to
		her and pray -- ?

	Memphis looks at him, still enthralled...

				ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd)
		I know, I know ... It's Eleanor ...
		Just take her, slick. - -

	And Atley drives off slowly, Memphis looks this way and that ...
	No one about ... He removes a SLIM JIM from a deep pocket in his
	coat... He slims the door panel ... Pops the button ... opens the
	door ...

	Watch him work. Quick as shit. A SCREWDRIVER appears another
	pocket ... He pops the BUTTERFLY to the IGNITION

	A RATCHET appears... He strips the mechanism... Now a GIZMO - a,small
	socket-like device - is pressed into the
	ignition ... A twist of the wrist ... And the 320-bhp 289 V8 rumbles
	like a jackhammer. The whole thing took 20 seconds.

	He takes a cassette TAPE from another pocket ... Slaps it into the
	deck. Bruce Springsteen's "Ramrod" wails from the coaxials.
	And Memphis floors it... And off they tear...

	The look on his face suggests a supreme satisfaction ... A grand
	re-awakening of long-dormant pleasure centers ... A speed Jones,
	fixed and fumy ...

	He slots in behind Atley Jackson's Firebird ... And slotting in
	behind Memphis, in a Z-28, is DONNY ASTRICKY, mid-30s ...

	On they go ... The fore and aft car providing escort...

	Except that, from seemingly out of nowhere --

	A POLICE CAR

	appears behind them...

	And Donny instantly goes into diversionary tactic ... He races
	through a STOP SIGN ... And the cruiser's bubbles flash on ... And
	Donny is pulled-over ... Atley and Memphis drive on in their
	respective vehicles...

	The UNIFORM COP gets out of his car, goes to Donny.

				DONNY
		Problem, Officer?

				POLICEMAN
		Yes. You're under arrest -- ?

				DONNY
		For running a stop sign?

				POLICEMAN
		For Grand Theft Auto -

	And off of Donny's look --

	We go to Memphis in the Shelby... As FOUR CRUISERS comes speeding
	toward him, sirens wailing...

	QUICK SHOTS of Memphis racing the Shelby through the early morning
	harbor town streets ... Sirens peel ... Memphis turns up the music
	... Pins the gas ... The chase is on ...

	Memphis maneuvers the Mustang with a dazzling aplomb... Memphis
	gutterballing the car, skating the shoulder, the cops in heavy
	pursuit ...

	And now he's picked up another CRUISER... He passes Atley Jackson,
	heading in the opposite direction... Atley has picked-up a pair of
	cruisers himself ...

	Memphis on a straightaway now, speeds up, feels the boost. But up
	ahead, a ROADBLOCK has formed... How'd they get that deployed so
	fast? And behind him, the unmarks blaze ...

	Guns his bitch... Straight at the roadblock .. Three CRUISERS and
	a PORTABLE WOODEN BARRICADE... Memphis pins her ... ZOOOOOM! Dead-on
	to the roadblock ...

	And, at the last moment, as the COPS dive out of the way, Memphis
	bangs the gear shift into neutral -- yanks the parking brake --
	And the Mustang spins on the straight -- Screeching spin ... And
	Memphis takes the HARD LEFT ...

	And he's managed to outrun them... Finding himself above Lower
	Grand... Looking down ...

	He can see the secondary pursuit down below ... Atley being
	chased... IN THE DISTANCE - Atley is LAUNCHED FROM THE SHOULDER,
	the Firebird rolling down a drainage culvert ...

	Landing with a sickening thud on its back. Memphis is horrified.

	EXT. LOWER GRAND - LATER

	Rescue team presence. Atley being hauled out of the wreck... His
	leg is a torn mess ... He's barely conscious... A cuffed Donny
	Astricky is dragged to a waiting cruiser ...

	A POLICE CAR pulls up ... And out steps

	DETECTIVE ROLAND CASTLEBECK

	of G.R.A.B. The Governor's Regional Auto-theft Bureau. Castlebeck
	is mid-50s, black, saturnine. - But don't let the tacit nobility
	fool you - the man's a street viper ...

	Castlebeck goes to another cop - HAWKINGS..

				HAWKINGS
		Astricky. And Jackson. No sign of
		Raines...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Well, then it's all for naught,
		ain't it, Hawkings?

	Castlebeck looks out over the mess ... And then looks up...
	Because, further down Lower Grand, a car is parked. It is the
	Shelby. With Memphis leaning against its hood...

	Castlebeck looks around him, but no one's noticed. So he walks
	toward it, hand on hip...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		I know you --

				MEMPHIS
		You know my back -

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		You want to come along quiet?

				MEMPHIS
		How's Atley -- ?

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Leg's all banged-up. He made a
		stupid play ... He'll limp around
		the yard up at Folsom. But
		Astricky will be there to take
		care of him. With their priors,
		they're looking at a serious bounce --

				MEMPHIS
		Let them go --

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		How's that?

				MEMPHIS
		Let them go. And I'll leave ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		You'll leave -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		You don't have anything on me. A
		misdee auto-theft. I got no record.
		I'll be out in three days, and back at 
		it. Or you let them go, and I give
		you my word. I'm gone. And without the
		ringleader ... Your tee-times have
		just grown exponentially...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		I don't golf...

	And they stare at each other, as Castlebeck considers.

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (cont'd)
		I do this. And I see you again. I'll
		come after you with everything I got.
		you won't be able to steal a glance
		at a blind man without me by your side ...

				MEMPHIS
		You have my word...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Get out of here, then. Now.

	And Memphis makes to get into the Shelby...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Leave the car, Randall ...

	Memphis nods ... Takes one last look at the Shelby... Sorry to 
	leave it behind ... And he runs off into the mists of Lower
	Grand ...

	Castlebeck walks back toward the crime-scene tumult ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Arright, let lim go. Cite him for
		rolling the stop ... And cite old
		Atley for driving to endanger ...

				HAWKINGS
		What are you talking about, Rollie? We're
		springing 'em? Just like that?

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Just like that. Quit your bellyaching,
		Hawkings ... And let's wrap this up ...

	And off of Donny's surprised look, as Springsteen wails to
	crescendo and we

									CUT TO:

	EXT. INDEPENDENCE, CALIFORNIA - DAY - 6 YEARS LATER

	Some 400 miles North of Los Angeles, Independence is a one
	horse town, and the horse has died... Single stop light,
	single-engine firehouse, single everything. Norman Rockwell
	would find this burg a snooze.. - We settle on a small,
	GARAGE ... The peeling sign reads:

	"L.N. ORR AUTOMOTIVE"

	owned and operated by Memphis Raines ... In blue coveralls,
	Memphis has a Plymouth Duster up on the lift ... With him is a kid
	- TOM, 19... Lightnin' Hopkins' "Automobile Blues" plays through --

				MEMPHIS
		You know what you got here?

				TOM
		Not really -

				MEMPHIS
		There's excessive resistance in the cranking
		circuit ... You know what you gotta do -- ?

				TOM
		Not really --

				MEMPHIS
		You have any other answers besides
		"not really"?

				TOM
		Not --

				MEMPHIS
		Right. You want to test the voltage drop ...
		Use the voltmeter ... Remove the primary
		lead from the ignitioncoil and crank her ...
		See what you got ... You understand -- ?

	Tom starts to say "not really". Instead, he nods. Memphis takes a
	root beer from an old-style machine. He goes out ... front ... To
	where an old Denver Pyle-coot - BUDGY - sits on a bench, smoking
	an unfiltered Lucky ... Memphis sits beside him, pets the 
	200-year-old DOG that lounges nearby...

				BUDGY
		Just can't find good help these days --

				MEMPHIS
			(re: cigarette)
		Those things'll kill ya, Budgy --

				BUDGY
		They won't have a chance. The bourbon and
		bacon'll get me first...

	Budgy cackles ... Memphis looks out at the dusty little hamlet ...
	Budgy points at a passing car ...

				BUDGY (cont'd)
		That one -

				MEMPHIS
		1980 Mercury Cougar. 255 cubic inch V8 ...
		Based on the Ford Thunderbird bodyshell;
		they modified the chassis, but didn't
		improve its performance...

	Budgy points at another car ... And we get the sense they play
	this game every day...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		The 1970 Plymouth Road Runner. Proof
		positive of a single all-powerful Deity.
		The first bargain-priced muscle car
		ever. They even tuned the horn to
		resemble the "beep beep" sound of the
		cartoon Road Runner ...

	And Budgy looks impressed... As always ...

				BUDGY
		Damn, you're good

	Memphis nods ... Sips his root beer ...

				BUDGY (cont'd)
		You got to bingo last night?

	Memphis looks at him ... Can't believe it himself ...

				MEMPHIS
		That I did, Budgy. That I did --

	And, from inside the garage, there's the most horrific GRIND of
	metal on metal, as Tom has started the Plymouth -

				TOM (O.S.)
		Uh ... Randall -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Excuse me --

	Memphis goes back into the garage, Budgy cackles.

		Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus
		would be at the corner of Hawthorne
		and Granvia --

				KIP
		He didn't mess up. There it is ...

	And he points ... To a CORNER BUILDING - EXOTIC MOTORS LTD. Twenty
	foot high glass - windows surround a SHOWROOM of EXOTIC DREAM
	CARS: Porsches and Ferraris, Lamborghinis and Bertones ... And-
	there it is, a 1996 LOTUS ESPRIT V8, gleaming in the all-night
	showroom lights...

	Freb and Mirror Man are startled

				FREB
		That -- ?

				MIRROR MAN
		You're shittin', right? Kip?

	He grins at them... He ain't shittin'...

				FREB
		How are we supposed to--

				KIP
		Pop the trunk. I need my tool ...

	Freb scowls ... Pops the trunk ... Kip gets out ... Goes to the
	back ... Freb and Mirror Man share a spook --

				MIRROR MAN
		What tool -- ?

	Kip reaches into the trunk.... Comes around to them... He's
	carrying A BRICK --

				MIRROR MAN (cont'd)
		Oh, no --

	And Kip walks toward "Exotic Motors"... Calm and cool ...
	Ten feet from it ... He winds up ... And HURLS THE BRICK AT
	THE WINDOW Which EXPLODES ON IMPACT, a SHOWER OF GLASS
	raining down ...

	ALARMS SQUEAL

	As Kip walks into the showroom, glass crunching underfoot. Freb
	and Mirror Man can't believe it --

	INT. EXOTIC MOTORS

	Kip goes to the Lotus... With nary a glance around, he's got her
	open ... The Lotus' ALARM adds its song to the choir ... Kip,
	unmindful, gets behind the wheel ... Screwdriver to the
	mechanism... The alarm raging in here...

	In moments, the V8's massive 349bhp is bellowing... And Mirror Man
	climbs in beside him... And off they go ... Laying several inches
	of English rubber. Over the broken glass and out of the
	showroom...

	EXT. CITY STREETS - PALOS VERDES - NIGHT

	The Lotus races through these streets ... At high speeds ...

				MIRROR MAN
		Newsflash, Kip: you're driving a
		stolen car

	Kip smiles over the ascending speedometer --

				KIP
		Yeah. Ain't it great -- ?

	And he pins her ... VROOOOOM -- !

									CUT TO:

	A TENNIS BALL

	being bounced against the wall ... Caught ... Bounced again ...
	Thunk! Thunk! Thunk!

	INT. WAREHOUSE - LONG BEACH HARBOR - NIGHT

	A dozen purloined AUTOS are parked here ... And a number of
	SHIPPING CONTAINERS ... A thuggish MAN reads the paper ... The
	tennis ball bouncer is TUMBLER, 20 ... And he's sitting on a
	tilted back chair, and wall-bouncing the ball and annoying the
	piss out of

	ATLEY JACKSON

	whom we remember from the drop-car at our opening ... Atley walks
	with a LIMP now... Thunk! Thunk! Thunk!

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Can you stop that, for Chrissake?

				TUMBLER
		What's your problem, bro ?

	Thunk! Thunk!

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Where are they -- ?

				TUMBLER
		They'll be here. You nervous, bro? You? Back
		in the day, they say you had anti-freeze in
		them veins ... What happened -- ?

	And Atley intercepts the tennis ball ... And hurls it over to the
	far side of the warehouse ... Tumbler merely grins ...

				TUMBLER (cont'd)
		Relax and enjoy --

	EXT. SAN PEDRO STREETS - THE LOTUS

	Heading for Long Beach... Stopped at a light ... A CAMARO pulls up
	next to them... A KID behind the wheel, a BLONDE beside him...

	Kip eyeballs them... Engines are revved... Challenges are
	implied... Mirror Man panics ...

				MIRROR MAN
		Stolen car, Kip. Stolen car, stolen car,
		stolen car ...

				KIP
		Stolen fast car...

	And the light turns green ... And he pops the clutch ... And
	they are off ... It's a good old fashioned drag race ... Kip
	smiles at the blonde ... Mirror Man is freaking out ... Kip's
	eyes are on fire ... He clocks the speedometer ...

				KIP (cont'd)
		It's calibrated for 140 ... Let's see
		if these British boys are full of shit
		or not --

				MIRROR MAN
		No way, man --

	Yes, way. Kip floors it. They bury the Camaro in its wake... The
	gauge rising ... 90, 100, 110 ... Mirror Man is having an
	embolism...

	They warp-speed by a POLICE CRUISER... Both kids totally unaware
	of the POLICE CHOPPER up on high... With them in its sights ...
	And they drive ... At last, ending up at --

	THE WATERFRONT - A dark latticework of docks and wharves,
	warehouses and shipping crates... The freighters are somehow
	graceful against the moonlit water ...

	INT. WAREHOUSE

	Tumbler studies his watch... Now he's a little concerned ... He
	looks up ... Atley is glaring at him...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Something wrong, Tumbler -- ?

				TUMBLER
		Yeah. I'm missing Springer --

	And then the Lotus pulls into the warehouse... Tumbler flashes
	Atley a "told-you-so" smile... Kip and Mirror Man get out of the
	car...

	Kip walks over to a CLIPBOARD with a magic marker tethered to it
	... It is a list of cars ... He draws a black line through "13)
	1996 Lotus Esprit V8"... The others are clocking the car...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		She'll go 0 to 60 in 4.9 seconds --

				MIRROR MAN
		I can vouch for that.

	Tumbler passes out 40 oz.s ... The vibe is celebratory...

				TUMBLER
		Thirteen down ... Thirty-seven to go ...

				KIP
		No problem -

	Bottles are clinked... Beer is sipped ... Only, a HOT WHITE
	SPOTLIGHT bores through the skylight ... And the whup-whup of the
	chopper's ROTORS... And now the sounds of SIRENS ... And the 
	thuggish man gets to his feet ...

				THUGGISH MAN
		Let's get outta here -- !

	And they do... Heading out the back ... It's tough for Atley with
	his limp ... On the way out:

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Now you gone and done it, Raines
		And they flee ...

	INT. WAREHOUSE - LATER - NIGHT

	A HALF-DOZEN POLICE CARS. The CHOPPER does the usual
	spotlight-trailing... It's turned into a total pig
	circus ... A car pulls to a stop ... And out steps Detective
	Roland Castlebeck, whom we remember from our opening...

	INT. WAREHOUSE

	Castlebeck surmises the take ... The cars ... His partner
	DETECTIVE DRYCOFF - a sneering Irish boy with zero patience -
	comes out from the back ...

				DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
		They're gone...

	Castlebeck nods ... Looks at the cars ...

	INT. "L.N. ORR AUTOMOTIVE" - INDEPENDENCE - DUSK

	Memphis goes through invoices in the cluttered back office. When a
	brand new purple MERCEDES SLK, windows tinted, pulls in out front.
	It looks oddly anachronistic here in Independence. Memphis senses
	danger. He goes out. Budgy and his dog are here... Budgy looks
	spooked... Tom, too ...

				MEMPHIS
		What's going on -- ?

	And standing there, by the Mercedes, like a wraith, is ATLEY
	JACKSON, in long leather coat, smoking a cigarette ... As out of
	place here as a maggot on a muffin...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Well, well, well ...

	And he begins to sing...

				ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd)
			(ANDY GRIFFITH theme)
		Da-doo-doo-doo-da-doo-doo-doo, etc.
			(laughs)
		Are you kidding me, man -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Hello, Atley ...

				ATLEY JACKSON (re: sign)
		L.N. ORR. I get it. Clever ...

	Memphis studies him...

				MEMPHIS
		How's the leg?

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Only hurts when I breathe. Lookit
		you. Where are Barney Fife and Aunt
		Bea hanging out? And Opie ... Where's
		Opie at?

	He laughs some more ... Chain-lights his cig ...

				MEMPHIS
		What are you doing here?

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Is there someplace we can talk?

	Memphis looks at him...

				MEMPHIS
		What about?

				ATLEY JACKSON
		About your brother. And the deeeep
		shit he's in --

	INT. TEDDY'S TAVERN - NIGHT

	A BARMAID sets down a pitcher of beer and two mugs...

				WAITRESS
		There you go --

				MEMPHIS
		Thanks, Donna --

	She leaves... Atley is staring at him... Memphis shrugs...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		It's been a long time, Memphis --

				MEMPHIS
		Six years ...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it?
		Six years ago we were fartin' through
		Armani and pissin' Cristal.
		Now look at us ...

		MEMPHIS
		Tell me about Kip -

	Atley takes a sip of his beer,...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		He took a job. And he fumbled it.
		Now he's jammed-up. Jammed-up bad...

				MEMPHIS
		What kind of job... ?

				ATLEY JACKSON
		A boost. A big boost ...

				MEMPHIS
		A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost?

	Atley frowns ... Looks at him...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		You're shittin', right?

	Clearly Memphis is not ...

				ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd)
		Kip's become quite the little
		crewrunner since you left. He's been
		working a low-rent ring for
		two years now. You don't talk to
		your Ma?

				MEMPHIS
		It seems she neglected to mention it

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Maybe she don't know. Although I don't
		see how that could be. Maybe she didn't
		want to upset you -

				MEMPHIS
		Don't feel the need to explore my family
		dynamics, Atley...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		The point is: Kip's been living the
		life. Only he's a wild child. Crazy.
		Makes our old behavior seem like
		altar boy time. But he fungold this
		one so bad, folks around L.B.
		are already speakin' about him in
		the past tense.

	Memphis takes a beat ... Sips at his brew ... Then:

				MEMPHIS
		Who was the job for?

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Who do you think?

	Memphis waits ... In no mood for guessing games ...

				ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd)
		Calitri, man. Raymond "The Carpenter"
		Calitri ... Your favorite and mine ...

	Which means nothing to us ... Though the look on Memphis, face
	speaks volumes ...

				ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd)
		I just thought you should know,
		man. I kind of had a feeling you
		didn't. But I should tell you:
		I'm working for him now - The
		Carpenter - so if you see him, you
		won't mention me coming to get
		you... Like I said: I just thought
		... I owed you ... And that it was
		the right thing to do ...

	Memphis nods ... His face clenched in despair. We FADE TO BLACK,
	As a SUPER on-screen reads: PART 1: STOLEN MOMENTS

	We PRE-LAP J. Geils Band's "Hard-Drivin' Man" and CUT TO:

	THREE PLATES OF BACON, EGGS AND HASH BROWNS

	placed on the service deck by a short-order COOK...

	INT. RUBY'S ALL-NITE - LONG BEACH - NIGHT

	A 24-hour diner in the heart of Long Beach... The three plates are
	picked-up with an impressive dexterity by

	HELEN RAINES

	early 60s, clear-eyed... In pink Ruby's uniform and chunky
	shoes... Black currant hair striated with wisps of gray... Helen
	delivers the plates to a booth of college kids ...

				KID
		Can I get some more coffee -- ?

				HELEN RAINES
		Sure, hon ...

	And she goes to the coffee station... When

				MEMPHIS (O.S.)
		Who's a guy gotta know to get a tuna
		melt in this joint -- ?

	And she turns around to see Memphis standing there. Her expression
	displays many things ... Most of them joy ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Hello, Ma --

	And she goes to Memphis ... Wraps her arms around him ... Squeezes
	tight ...

				HELEN RAINES (cont'd)
		Oh, Randall ...

	She takes his head in her hands ... Kisses his cheek ... Then the
	other... Hugs on ... Unmindful of the customers ... The cook
	smiles from behind the order wheel ...

				COOK
		What's the word, Memphis -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		How ya doing, Ruby -- ?

				HELEN RAINES
		Come, come, come ...

	And she leads him over to a booth ... Barking to the cook - RUBY -
	on the way...

				HELEN RAINES (cont'd)
		Tuna melt on pumpernickel.  Provolone,
		extra tomato, Dijon... And a chocolate
		milk... Lots of syrup...
			(to Memphis)
		Right?

				MEMPHIS
		Right ...

	And they settle in ... Across the booth from each other ... She
	takes his hands...

				HELEN RAINES
		You look good...

				MEMPHIS
		You, too, Ma...

				HELEN RAINES
		What are you doing back?

				MEMPHIS
		How's Kip?

	And Helen flushes, a bit ashamed maybe ...

				HELEN RAINES
		Have you seen him?

				MEMPHIS
		No.

				HELEN RAINES
		oh.

				MEMPHIS
		Atley Jackson came to see me ...

				HELEN RAINES
		Atley Jackson. How is that one?
		How's the leg... ?

	He looks at her ... Beat ...

				MEMPHIS
		Why didn't you tell me?

				HELEN RAINES
		I couldn't. I didn't want you to
		worry. I thought held sort himself
		out. I hardly see him. He comes and
		goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?

				MEMPHIS
		He's in some trouble ...

				HELEN RAINES
		I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a
		different boy. He's lost that... That
		sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't
		know what to do ...

				MEMPHIS
		You getting my checks ... ?

				HELEN RAINES
		Of course ...

	ANGLE - RUBY. He's on the PHONE in the kitchen...One eye
	on Memphis and Helen --

				RUBY
		Detective Castlebeck... It's me ...
		Yeah... You ain't never gonna guess
		who just come in to visit his Ma --

	BACK TO - MEMPHIS AND HELEN RAINES ...

				HELEN RAINES (cont'd)
		You haven't spoken to him in a
		while, I guess...

				MEMPHIS
		He doesn't return my calls. or my
		letters ...

				HELEN RAINES
		Kipling was sixteen when you left, baby.
		I don't know what you remember of him.
		But you should brace yourself

	And, on her sad smile, we PRE-LAP Sammy Hagar's "I Can't Drive 55"
	and SLAM CUT TO:

	INT. "THE SIDE POCKET" - POOL HALL - NIGHT

	A dozen tables... Smells of blue chalk and whiskey... The juke box
	cranked... We take it to the back of the joint ... Where Kip, and
	Tumbler and Mirror Man are knocking a rack... Freb sits nearby,
	with a few badly made-up GIRLS...

				TUMBLER
		... so ... It's my new move ... It's called
		"The Stranger." What I do is, I sit on
		my hand for 10 minutes.  Till it falls
		asleep. Till it's good and numb. No feeling.
		And then I jerk off.

				GIRL
		That's disgusting -

				FREB
		What's the point, man -- ?

				TUMBLER
		Cos it's like you're bein' done by a stranger
		... It rocks ... It's the power move of the
		New Millennium...

	He sinks another ball. A kid, 15, TOBY - comes up to them.

				TOBY
		Hey, Kip, what's up?

				KIP
		What do you say, Toby?,

				TOBY
		I'm cool -

				TUMBLER
		What do you want, shithead?

				TOBY
		Why you gotta front me like that? I'm
		talking to Kip --

				TUMBLER
		Why don't you leave him alone?

				TOBY
		I known Kip longing than you, man ...

				TUMBLER
		Oooh, ain't you the lucky duck --

				FREB
		Any word, Kip -- ?

				KIP
		No ... And they won't take my calls ...

				FREB
		What does that mean -- ?

				KIP
		It ain't what you'd call a "good sign"

	He groks their fear...

				KIP (cont'd)
		Look - we managed to get 13 in a week.
		We just gotta step it up ...

				FREB
		But we only got till Friday. That's
		four days. And we lost the 13. So's
		we gotta start over ...

	Kip looks at him...

				KIP
		That, too ...
			(off of Freb's look of fright)
		Don't sweat it, Freb. We're cool.

	ANGLE THE FRONT DOOR. For Memphis has entered. He
	clocks the room. Sees them at the rear ... Walks back

				KIP
		It can be done, man. We just gotta
		step it up... It's a challenge ...

				MIRROR MAN
		The challenge is not to get our nuts
		cut-off and shoved down our throats ...

				TUMBLER
		Can I help you, pal -- ?

	And Kip looks up ... To see Memphis there ...

				MEMPHIS
		Hey, Kip ...

				KIP
		Hello, Memphis --

				TUMBLER
		"Memphis?" You're Memphis?

				MEMPHIS
		That's right...

				TUMBLER
		Damn. Damn, damn, damn ...

				FREB
		Memphis. Holy shit. It's an honor,
		man --

	And he pumps his hand... Memphis continues to stare at Kip

				KIP
		It's good to see ya, man. You changed
		your look -

				MEMPHIS
		You, too

	Hold the stare... The others are excited...

				FREB
		What are you doing back, Memphis?

				MEMPHIS
		Little visit. Check on the family.

				KIP
		It's nice to see ya, man -

	He smiles ... Memphis eyeballs him... Toby is there ...

				TOBY
		Hey, Memphis. Remember me? Toby
		Walker. I live next door ...

				MEMPHIS
		Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up

				TOBY
		Yeah, I'm cool ...

	And Memphis turns back to Kip, who's picked up a pool cue.

				KIP
		Who's got next game -- ?

	And he makes to rack 'em up ... Then:

				MIRROR MAN
		I get it. You ain't gotta be a genius:
		Memphis come back to save our bacon!

				TUMBLER
		Shut-up, Mirror Man --

				FREB
		Izzat true? You come back to save our
		bacon?

				MIRROR MAN
		Of course it's true. He come to save
		his brother's dangling ass --

				KIP
		That can't be it. Cos we don't need
		saving

				FREB
		We don't -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		He give you an advance -- ?

				MIRROR MAN
		Hell, yeah. Ten larger man

	Kip shoots him a look... As if he's spoken out of turn ...

				MEMPHIS
		You just give 'im back the money.
		All's well...

	The others look glum... Kip laughs ... Long and hard...

				KIP
		"Give lim back the money." "Give 'im
		back the money..." Be nice. If only
		we didn't drink the money. And smoke
		the money. And buy Nikes with the
		money. And Sony Play Stations with the
		money. And dirty girls with the
		money...

	And Kip sinks a ball ... Memphis looks at the others ... They
	nod... It's true ... The money's gone ...

				KIP
		But don't worry, man. Things are all
		sweetness and light here...

				TUMBLER
		Things are all leafy and suburban ...

				MIRROR MAN
		The hell they are --

				KIP
		Sure they are. Although we do appreciate the
		gesture, Memphis. But we do got it handled...
		And it was nice to see you -- -

	Memphis nods ... Looks at all of them... Smiles ... And then
	REACHES OUT, GRABBING Kip by the collar, yanking him to his feet
	and in close, nose to nose ...

				MEMPHIS
		You listen to me, baby brother. You fancy
		yourself some reat neat tough guy scumbum,
		well, woop-tee-doo, little puppy with a
		poundcake. But I remember the days when you
		used to steal my Colorforms and eat 'em...
		So you can't stop me from saving your
		"dangling ass' if that's what I feel like
		doing...

	And with that, he shoves Kip back down into his seat, toppling the
	table, bottles and glasses crashing... And barrels away from them,
	the crowd parting like a wound...

	Kip's crew left stunned, flustered, and maybe a bit impressed...

				TUMBLER
		Damn... Homeboy's on the dazzle ...

	And, off of Kip's furious look, we CUT TO:

	EXT. LONG BEACH HARBOR - NIGHT

	A chill in the air. Memphis walks toward a range of lowslung
	buildings ...

	EXT. WOODBURN SCRAP AND METAL - NIGHT

	A virtual cityscape of dismantled automobile carcasses, piled up
	high for as far as the eye can see ... A huge FORK LIFT scoops up
	a wreck and hauls it over to the CRUSHER... Watch as the car is
	FLATTENED, for easy shelving ...

	Midnight auto nonpareil ... To one side of the yard is a GARAGE:
	Watch as a HONDA ACCORD, with a BLOODY WINDSHIELD, enters the
	garage. A young Mexican KID driving.

	A SIGN: "LOCK YOUR CAR OR IT MAY BE GONE IN 60 SECONDS!"

	INT. GARAGE - CHOP SHOP

	A CAR is CHOPPED ... Pulled apart ... Fenders, doors, panels,
	interiors, air bags ...

	EXT. WOODBURN SCRAP AND METAL - FRONT ENTRANCE

	Memphis knocks on the door ... A dog-faced MAN opens it ...

				DOG-FACE
		Yeah -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Randall Raines to see Mr. Calitri ...

	INT. WOODBURN SCRAP AND METAL

	Memphis follows Dog-face to the back of this building. Follows him
	into another room. Which is

	A WORKSHOP

	An enormous WOODWORKING SHOP, fully tricked-out with state-of-the-
	art table saws and drill presses, jointers and power planes.

	An antique treadle lathe stands in one corner. A stock layout of
	expensive woods - oak, birch, maple, cherry, mahogany - is stacked
	against the rear wall ...

	Jars and bottles and cakes of glues, resins, stains and bleaches
	cram a shelf unit ... There's a MAN here, at a band saw. This is
	RAYMOND CALITRI, 59 ...

	He wears an apron, protective glasses and a lopsided sneer. A
	Richard Widmark motherfucker - with the diamond hard look of a
	cobra. The liegelord of downtown...

	And now he works the a hand saw, making critical cross-cuts on a
	wide panel of maple ... Atley Jackson is here as well ... As noisy
	as it is out in the yard, in here, once the door is closed, it's
	as SILENT-as a tomb...

	A BANK OF MONITORS on one wall show the cars being crushed and
	disassembled in the yard. Memphis is led into the room.

	Calitri nods and Dog-face leaves the room... Calitri smiles ...
	Examines his fresh cut...

				CALITRI
		Randall Raines ... It's been a long time ...
			(looks at his clothes;)
			frowns)
		'though I do I recall you as a man
		with style. You remember your old
		friend, Atley -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		How ya doing?

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Good to see you, Memphis --

				CALITRI
		So. What do we owe the honor -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		It's about my brother ... Kip...

				CALITRI
		Yes ... Kip ...

	He says the name like other men say "cancer." The phone on
	his desk BLINKS. Calitri picks it up. Listens. Looks at
	one of the monitors. Where the Mexican man is talking to
	several Calitri EMPLOYEES. Calitri hangs up...

				CALITRI
		Excuse me one moment, Randall ...

	And he picks up a MORTISE CHISEL on his way out. Palming it ...

	INT. GARAGE - THE MEXICAN MAN

	is sobbing. As Raymond Calitri marches toward him, glancing at the
	bloodied windshield.

				CALITRI
		You bring this to me in this
		condition? Blood and guts all
		over it? You make me complicit?
		On my property? Who taught you
		how to think? And worst of all:
		weren't there supposed to be two
		Hondas?

				THIEF
		Please ...

	And Calitri, rapid-fire, PUNCTURES the man's belly and chest and
	legs with the chisel, old-school prison-shiv style ... Until the
	man is on the floor, howling ...

				CALITRI
		Stupid sonuvabitch...

	INT. CALITRI'S WORKSHOP

	Memphis can-see this from one of the monitors. He looks at
	Atley...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Car-jacker. Neglected to clean up after
		himself ...

				MEMPHIS
		Jesus ...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		The business has changed...

	Calitri is back, wiping the sweat from his brow with a rag.

				CALITRI
		Now. Where were we? Oh, yes. Kip.

				MEMPHIS
		I don't want him hurt...

	Calitri looks at him, then waves a hand around the shop...

				CALITRI
		I'm proud of this work. The bird
		feeder. The wagon wheel planter.
		The dollhouse. The drop-leaf movable
		server...

	He gestures to each item - exquisitely-rendered woodwork. Then
	gestures to the yard...

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		Metal. Steel. It's cold. Ugly. Wood
		is warm. Clean. Provided by nature.
		To see a piece of furniture take shape.
		It's like watching a child grow ...

	Memphis glances to Atley... Atley shrugs ...

				MEMPHIS
		I'm sure you're working your way to
		the point.  I'll wait right here ...

	Calitri blinks. Smiles. Nods...

				CALITRI
		My point. Yes. Simple, really. I require
		the best. I insist on the best. I only
		engage the best.  Your brother. His
		friends. They came to me. They wanted my
		paper. He was your brother. You were the
		best. Now. They've brought so much
		goddamn heat down, I may not be able to
		fill this order. Which would be very bad
		for me. Which in turn, is very bad for
		them...

				MEMPHIS
		I could kill you. That occurred to me.
		When I first heard about this. That I
		would kill you ...

				CALITRI
		Grow up. You don't kill people like me.
		People like me die in their sleep at
		87 ... Do you know why? Because if
		you did kill me, and everyone knew it
		was you - for the next ten years they'd
		be finding pieces of those you love
		scattered all over California ...

	Memphis nods, notes a PISTOL, resting on a shelf nearby.

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		No, no. You don't kill me, because
		you can't. You don't take your brother
		and run, because we'd find him. You
		don't go to the-police, because we have
		friends there, too. You do nothing:
		except deal with me.

	Memphis eyes him...

				MEMPHIS
		I can come up with the front money.
		Pay you back...

				CALITRI
		Were it only that easy. I have
		obligations. The order needs to be
		filled...

	Calitri takes a manila ENVELOPE from his desk... Hands it to
	Memphis, who takes out the SINGLE SHEET OF PAPER inside.

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		On that list, you'll find fifty cars.
		Fifty. Five-zero. They range in
		age from the 1956 Ford Thunderbird
		to the 1999 Toyota Camry; and in
		expense from the 1993 Volkswagen
		Jetta to the 1988 Lamborghini
		Countach. Fifty cars. Five-zero.

	Memphis scans the list ... Looks up at Calitri ...

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		There is a container ship in Long
		Beach Harbor. Pier 14. Ready to be
		loaded with 4-car-per shipping
		containers, false-walled and
		customsprofiled as motor oil
		designated. The ship leaves in four
		days for South America and the
		men who've tendered me this contract ...

				MEMPHIS
		They gave you only four days?

				CALITRI
		They gave me two weeks. I wasted most of it
		with your brother and his crew, who not
		only lost what pitiful few they managed
		to boost, but also alerted the heat as to our
		endeavor, making this even more difficult
		to achieve ...

	Memphis scans the list ...

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		Four days. 50 cars. I'm paying 200
		thousand dollars ...

	Now Memphis looks up...

				MEMPHIS
		I'm not interested --

				CALITRI
		I knew you'd say that.

				MEMPHIS
		I'm just here about my brother.

				CALITRI
		I knew you'd say that, too --

	Calitri smiles ... Memphis 'looks at him... At Atley Realizing
	the trap ...

				MEMPHIS
		Sound it out for me.

				CALITRI
		Your brother has four days. Fifty
		cars. Five-zero. For that he gets
		200 large ...

				MEMPHIS
		And if he doesn't make it -- ?

	Calitri goes to one corner of the shop... Takes a tarp off
	of a full couch MAHOGANY CASKET...

				CALITRI
		I made this, too. My first one.
		Brass extension handles, not plated.
		The coverings are silk, not rayon.
		Expensive hardwood. And lined with
		spray green Lorraine crepe ...

	Memphis waits, knowing where this is going --

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		Yes, yes. I made it for young Kip. In
		case he fails. At 8:00 Friday morning,
		if that ship sets off without my
		fifty ... Kip will take up permanent
		residence in this box ...

	Calitri WALL SWITCH and the a corrugated steel SLIDING DOOR is
	RAISED, revealing a LOADING DOCK facing the back of the yard... Two
	MEN are working out there... DIGGER AND BUTZ scuzzy dudes, mid-30s
	and dressed in dirty coveralls ...

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		Come here for a second, boys --

	And they come over --

				DIGGER
		Evenin', Mr. C. --

				CALITRI
		Digger, Butz: let me introduce
		you to Randall Raines. Used to
		head up the dandiest ring in
		Southern Cal. Left us
		for parts unknown. Randall, this
		is Digger. And that's Butz -

				DIGGER
		Hi, Randall --

	Memphis says nothing. Calitri grins ... Nods to Digger an Butz,
	who go back to work...

				CALITRI
		Digger and Butz will be in charge of burial.
		They're good boys ...

	Memphis' look is cold and furious ... Plaintive:

				MEMPHIS
		I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...

				CALITRI
		"don't want" the Dodgers to lose or
		the summer to end. But we
		don't get to choose these things...

	Atley hits the wall-switch and the steel door slides shut. Calitri
	turns to Memphis...

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		"Nothing that's forced can ever be
		right." Old woodworking expression.
		I really don't care how the 50
		get onto my ship ... I just care
		that they do. You decide.

	With that, he puts his protective glasses back on - and fires up
	an abrasive-disc-finishing machine, adjusting the miter gage and
	beginning to sand the Outside curve of an angled chamfer.

	EXT. HELEN RAINES' HOUSE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

	A small New England-style shingle and clapboard, up on a hill
	overlooking the port. A small GUEST-HOUSE behind it ...

	INT. HELEN RAINES' HOUSE

	Helen clears away the dinner dishes ... The TV is on. The news. We
	see a CRIME SCENE ...

				REPORTER

	Memphis glances to the TV... Grimaces ... He looks out the window
	... At the SEDAN parked below...

	EXT. RAINES' HOUSE - NIGHT

	Memphis comes out ... Moves to the sedan parked across the street
	... it is Detectives Castlebeck and Drycoff...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		I know you.

				MEMPHIS
		You know my back.

	They get out of the car... The view of San Pedro from up here is a
	spectacular bedspread of lights ...

				DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
		When'd you get to town, Raines?

				MEMPHIS
		The other day....

				DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
		What for?

				MEMPHIS
		No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I
		heard we got Shaquille ...

				DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
		Where you been, anyway?

				MEMPHIS
		Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my
		collection of refrigerator magnets ...

				DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
		You seem a little hinked-up ...

				MEMPHIS
		Not at all ...

	He and Castlebeck lock eyes ... Castlebeck takes a pear from his
	coat pocket ... Sets to polishing it ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		I remember us having made some
		kind of deal, Randall. I don't
		remember this deal having some kind
		of time-limit. I look at you -
		here - in my town - and I'm
		confused...

				MEMPHIS
		A little family emergency --

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		I hope it's not your dear sweet
		mother...

				MEMPHIS
		No...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Or your baby brother. What was his
		name?

				MEMPHIS
		Kip.

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Yes, Kip. Short for Kipling.
		Named for the English writer
		of stories about India ...
		He bites into his pear ...
		Memphis says nothing, waits ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (cont'd)
		I got a rash of thefts.  A new crew is
		making noise. We recovered a big take -
		last week...

				MEMPHIS
		And this has what to do with me?

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		I don't know. But you shouldn't
		be here. Take care of your business.
		I'll give you 24 hours. And
		then I don't want to see your face.
		Ever again. Make a fool of me
		once, that's my bad. Make a fool of
		me twice. That's really my
		bad, and I'll kick your ass from
		here to India ...

	Castlebeck gives him a long look... As they walk back to the car...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Good. Cos you know how it plays.
		Six years ago, I let you go free. But
		the next time ... The next time sends
		you away for'a long, long while ...

				DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
		By the time you get out, asshole, there
		won't even be cars. We'll all be cruisin'

	He laughs... And they drive off ... Memphis watching them go ...
	once they're gone... He walks ...

	EXT. "THE SIDE POCKET" - BACK ALLEY EXIT - NIGHT

	Kip comes out of the club... Toby follows ...

				TOBY
		You goin' home?

				KIP
		Yeah... You want a ride...

				TOBY
		Sure -

				KIP
		How'd you get here? Your Moms give you
		ride -- ?

				TOBY
		Hell, no. I boosted a 'Vette.

				KIP
		You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it?

				TOBY
		I dunno. It was right here. Someone
		musta' boosted it back...

				KIP
		Damn crooks is everywhere --

	They smile...And go to Kip's TRANS AM...

				TOBY (cont'd)
		Memphis seemed weird, huh? What's with
		them clothes? He a farmer now or
		something?

	And this seems funny to Kip... He smiles..

				KIP 
		Yeah. Except the only thing he's growing
		is old...

	And they are fronted by TWO GOONS ... Who toss them up against the
	wall...

				KIP (cont'd)
		What do you want -- ?

	One of the goons SOCKS Toby in the gut. Toby doubles over. Kip
	strains to intervene, but his goon holds him back --

				KIP
		Don't you do that! You leave him alone!

				GOON
		Shaddup, Raines

				KIP
		He's got nothing to do with this --

	And the goon punches him in the face. And Kip goes down. And out.

				GOON
		Get him in the car

	EXT. WOODBURN SCRAP AND METAL - NIGHT

	Kip comes to. In his car. Hot white lights blind him. The Trans
	Am is in the crusher. FIGURES above him. Calitri. The goons ...

				CALITRI
		Hello, Kip --

	Kip tries to get out. The doors are pinned by the forklift.

				KIP
		Lemme out of this --

				CALITRI
		Were it only that easy --

				KIP
		We can still do it --

	Calitri nods ... And the crusher presses ... The roof caves a bit
	... Kip is close to scrunch ...

				CALITRI
		No you can't. Flies on sherbert is what you
		remind me of. Because just being attracted
		to something, doesn't mean you belong...

	INT. CALITRI'S WOODSHOP

	Atley is here, watching Calitri and Kip. one of the monitors. He's
	miserable. But there is nothing he can do.

	EXT. SCRAPYARD - NIGHT

	Kip continues to struggle free...

				KIP
		Listen, Calitri --

				CALITRI
		Call me "Ray." Better yet: call me
		"asshole." Cos that's how you've
		treated me --

				KIP
		I get out of this I'm gonna fuck
		you up --

	Calitri does have to admire the stones on the kid. But. Another
	nod. Another crusher-press. Another scrunch...

				KIP (cont'd)
		Calitri -- !

	Nothing. Silence. Kip peers through the slit that the
	side window has become ... Only they are gone ... And there
	is another awful NOISE ... Kip strains to discern its
	origin ... Only he can't get the angle ...

	We can. It's a huge CRANE, tipped with a GRIPPING CLAW... It is
	maneuvered over the Trans Am... Grasps it. . . And LIFTS IT 
	INTO THE AIR ... Kip, terrified, inside ...

	And, as the crane dangles the Trans Am toward the black waters of
	the harbor, we CUT TO:

	INT. HELEN RAINES' HOUSE - KITCHEN

	Memphis is at the kitchen table. The list of cars before him. He's
	making notations. He gets to his feet ... He goes to check on his
	mother ... She's asleep in her room... He closes the door ...

	And goes back to the kitchen. He goes to a framed PHOTOGRAPH - of
	he and Kip. Earlier times. Happier times.

	When there is an enormous THUD! From outside. Memphis goes to a
	window. Sees a RAMP TRUCK unloading a gnarled blob of metal.
	Memphis runs outside. Just as the ramp truck drives off ...

	Memphis goes to the mangled Trans Am... Leans down ... And there's
	Kip ... Seriously smooshed in the flattened car.

				MEMPHIS
		Kip -- ?

				KIP
		Yeah ...

				MEMPHIS
		You all right -- ?

				KIP
		I think so. There's things I can't
		feel right now. Like my feet. But ...
		You think you can get me outta this,
		Memphis? I'd appreciate it -

				MEMPHIS
		Just hold-on there --

	Memphis goes to the garage ... Finds a crowbar, an acetylene
	TORCH, tin-snips ... He goes back to the wrecked car... And sets
	to work... He looks at Kip ... Shakes his head...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		So you want to run that part by me
		again about things being "all
		sweetness and light..."

				KIP
		This has nothing to do with any
		of that --

				MEMPHIS
		Oh. You maybe have more than one
		enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?

				KIP
		All my enemies own car crushers. 
		It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...

				MEMPHIS
		Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost
		there...

	Indeed... Memphis has freed him ... Kip crawls from the wreckage
	... His clothes in tatters... Blood seeps from a variety of
	contusions ... He limps ... Memphis helps him to the guest house
	...

	INT. KIP'S GUEST HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT

	Small, cluttered... Posters of Kurt Cobain, a skying Kobe Bryant,
	Pamela Anderson, two nude girls draped over a glittering
	Lamborghini Espada, etc. There's a fish tank... And a big-screen
	TV, on which the Lakers are currently defending a high-speed
	Boston Celtic fast-break...

	Memphis sits on a ratty couch before the TV... Kip comes out of
	the bedroom... He's changed clothes ... He wears clunky fur-lined
	MOON BOOTS, leopard-skin Speedos and a tshirt ... He looks
	slightly ridiculous...

	Throughout the scene, Memphis should be studying Kip, as if he's
	seeing him for the very first time ... And waiting for the
	inevitable crack...

				MEMPHIS
		You okay -- ?

				KIP
		Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer,
		man -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Sure --

	And Kip limps toward the refrigerator ... He comes back with two
	beers ... Hands one to Memphis ... Glances at the TV --

				KIP
		you like Kobe's game? I do. You
		think he's heir apparent to MJ? I do.
		He speaks fluent Italian, you know? So he's
		got that going for him --

	And a cut on Kip's forehead starts to bleed ... Kip grabs a towel
	... Presses it to his head --

				MEMPHIS
		You sure you're okay -- ?

				KIP
		Yeah, man. Where is your beer?

	Memphis holds it up ... Kip nods ... There are a pile of IGNITIONS
	on the table ... Kip picks one up, absently begins trying to strip
	it...

				KIP
		Cool. So you're living up North?

				MEMPHIS
		Yeah -

				KIP
		I heard you were pumping gas -

				MEMPHIS
		Something like that -

				KIP
		You're kind of cultivating a new look.

				MEMPHIS
		Yeah --

	Beat ... They watch the game ... Kip replaces the soaked towel
	with another ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Maybe you need a stitch --

				KIP
		Nah. It's a scratch.

				MEMPHIS
		Okay --

	Beat ...

				KIP
		Hey, you want something to eat ?

				MEMPHIS
		What do you got ... ?

	And Kip hoists himself painfully to his feet ... Limps over to the
	'fridge ... Memphis watches him, a slight grin at Kip's attempt at
	cool ... Kip peers into the 'fridge ...

				KIP
		Not much. I got olives. You like
		olives?
		Kalamata olives rule, I think. Ma likes
		the Calabrese. It's more mellow

	And he brings over a bowl of olives.

				MEMPHIS
		There's certainly a time and a place
		for a mellow olive -

				KIP
		Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking --

	And they nibble on them. Kip bites into one ... And the juice
	stings his cracked lip ... But he disguises his grimace as an
	appreciative nod...

	And for a moment, they nibble olives and drop pits into an
	ashtray... Then:

				MEMPHIS
		So what are you gonna do?

				KIP
		About what?

				MEMPHIS
		"About what?"

				KIP
		About Calitri? No worries, man.
		I'll call him. He's a reasonable
		dude ...

				MEMPHIS
		I can see that -

	And Memphis glances out the window. To the crushed car. Kip
	catches the glance, glances himself, chooses to ignore it.

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		You have everything ... under
		control?

				KIP
		Yeah. He just wants to know I'm
		still on it. He needs reassurance.
		All these big swinging dicks do.
		No worries. I won't let him get
		into our Kool-Aid...

	Kip shrugs ... Picks up another olive... Remembers the pain' of
	the last one... Drops it back in the bowl ... Memphis is staring
	at him, disgusted... Kip feels it ...

				KIP (cont'd)
		What -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		What happened to you?

				KIP
		What?

	And now Memphis gets to his feet ... Paces the place...

				MEMPHIS
		You just got crushed in a car. You're
		bleeding all over your self. And you
		sit there - eating olives and talking
		basketball, as if, at this very
		moment, people weren't plotting
		your demise ...

				KIP
		C'mon, man... My "demise..."
			(chuckles)
		Overreaction

				MEMPHIS
		"Over--"  You know - I can maybe
		understand, since I been gone, you
		taking up this dumb-ass life of
		crime, and for that I can partly
		blame myself. But what is baffling
		to me, is how, since I been gone,
		you've become a complete and total
		moron--

				KIP
		Hey, now -

				MEMPHIS
		He's gonna kill you -- !

				KIP
		I can handle it --

				MEMPHIS
		You can handle it?

				KIP
		I can handle it --

				MEMPHIS
		You can handle it?

				KIP
		I can handle it --

				MEMPHIS
		You?

				KIP
		Me.

				MEMPHIS
		You?

				KIP
		Me...

	Beat ... Hold the look ... Kip shifts in his chair ... Even this
	hurts... He tries to hide the wince ... Memphis goes to the 
	window, looks out at the harbor below... Beat ... Then:

				KIP (cont'd)
		Why? You think you can help me?

	And he turns back to Kip ...

				KIP (cont'd)
		What can you do? You haven't done
		anything in six years but pump gas 
		and go overall shopping. And 
		the cars, they've changed ...
		There's new shit. Computer chip
		keys and sophisticated alarms and
		I don't think, an old guy, could much
		bypass 'em...

				MEMPHIS
		You don't think so, huh?

				KIP
		Not really ... But you know... Maybe
		I'm wrong ...

	And the brothers look at each other ... In the pale glow of the
	TV... For a long beat ... And then we'll CUT TO:

	EXT. LONG BEACH HARBOR - CANNERY / FISH AUCTION - DAY

	A rack of eel and OCTOPUS hung out to dry in the salty sun ...

	Memphis walks with Atley Jackson past the bustling commercial
	fishing hubbub: Portuguese FISHERMEN unloading albacore and
	bluefin from their ship's hold; Greek FISHERMEN emptying mackerel
	and halibut from their nylon trawl nets; their WOMEN gut, clean
	and fillet ...

	As they walk, Atley is selecting FISH from the various MARINERS
	... Who wrap it up for him... He places it in a leather satchel
	... Everyone seems to know him...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Nicolo, how's the yellowtail today?

	An old FISHERMAN, who speaks broken English, wraps up several
	steaks...

				FISHERMAN
		Very nice, Atley. Very nice ...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		You can't get it any fresher than this,
		Memphis ... From the sea to my
		skillet ... Nothing in between...

				MEMPHIS
		What's with the fish thing -- ?

				ATLEY JACKSON
		We can learn something from our Asian
		friends. They smoke a thousand
		cigarettes a day; they're completely
		stressed and overworked; they drink
		like, well ...

				MEMPHIS
		Fish.

				ATLEY JACKSON
		And they still have the lowest rate of
		cancer of anywhere in the world. You
		know why? All they eat is seafood.

				MEMPHIS
		Also, never underestimate the restorative
		powers of "Karaoke."

				ATLEY JACKSON
		I do a poaching number. Six-ounce
		fillets in a saucepan of brine. In
		8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn
		wedding. Plain but flavorful. And
		it's a good way to show off my
		Hollandaise sauce ...

				MEMPHIS
		You have a Hollandaise sauce ?

				ATLEY JACKSON
		I do ...
			(laughs)
		Christ, what happened to us ?

				MEMPHIS
		Speak for yourself, boss I don't
		have a Hollandaise sauce

				ATLEY JACKSON
		No, but you dress like an asshole ...

	They walk...

				MEMPHIS
		I think about that night a lot...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Me, too. Every time I walk...

				MEMPHIS
		How they were just there ... Waiting on
		us ... The fix was definitely in ...

	Nothing from Atley... They walk ... Memphis looks at him.

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Yeah, you know: I just. I just
		never really thanked-you. I meant
		to. I just want you to
		know...

	Memphis nods. Atley shrugs, and selects some halibut
	filets.

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Tell him it's on ...

	Atley looks at him...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Yeah -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and
		them Tell him it's on

	Atley nods...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Any idea how you're gonna go at it?

	Memphis looks at him... Shakes his head... FADE TO BLACK.

	As a SUPER on-screen reads: PART II - BACK TO WRONG

	EXT. OTTO'S AUTO - NIGHT

	The hustle and bustle of a full-service auto restoration
	operation ...

	Dig the 157 Chevy, as an orange diamond tuck and roll with
	orange fur interior is installed... Dig the 153 Corvette
	as its front and rear suspension is replaced with coils
	and airshocks ... Dig the 150 Merc, as its chrome is
	stripped off and the old paint sandblasted and holes
	brazed...

	All under the watchful eye of...

	OTTO HALLIWELL

	Late 60s. A feisty grease-soaked curmudgeon who begs the
	question: how the hell did they manage to rock together
	Yoda and the ghost of Walter Huston... ?

	But he remains the Zen master of cars and all that cars are, were
	and can be ...

	His mixed-breed MUTT - Hemi - licks his balls in one corner

	Otto is currently AIRBRUSHING a candy-colored, variegated DESIGN
	on the deck lid of a Camaro ... It is painstaking work ... But he
	is an artist ...

	His woman - JUNIE - a tall blonde, early 40s, body of a thousand
	dances, wipes his brow, like a scrub nurse ...

	Memphis wanders in...

	Otto sees Memphis ... Drops his brush... He walks over to Memphis
	... Takes him in his arms ... Hugs him close... Actually waltzes
	him a few steps ...

	Memphis is stunned at the transformation this place has gone
	through ...

				OTTO
		Am I dying? Are all the angels of my life
		returning to bid a final farewell?
			(holds him at arm's length)
		And have my angels completely lost
		their fashion sense -- ?
			
				MEMPHIS
		Hello, Otto ...

				OTTO
		You remember Junie?

				MEMPHIS
		Of course. Hi, Junie --

				JUNIE
		Hello, Memphis -

				MEMPHIS
		What happened here -- ?

				OTTO
		Whatever do you mean?

				MEMPHIS
		The chop-shop... Where are the stripped
		cars?  The rolled-back odometers? The
		part bins?

				OTTO
		What happened? Old-age happened. I tired of
		killing them. I woke up one morning and thought
		I am no longer a destroyer. I am a means of
		resurrection. Now. We restore. We revive.
		There are so few things in this life, we can
		prevent from decay. Most must die. These don't
		have to...

	He calls over to the MEXICAN MAN working on the pick-up ...

				OTTO (cont'd)
		It's 3 coats of primer, 12 coats of black
		acrylic lacquer before laying out the
		flames ... And fill the cab top with mylar
		flakes ... They'll sparkle like stars ...
			(turns to Memphis)
		Randall, Randall, Randall ... You look
		splendid ...

				MEMPHIS
		You, too, Otto

	And Otto goes back to the Camaro ... To finish his work...

				OTTO
		I heard rumors you were back. About
		Kip ...

				MEMPHIS
		He's gotten involved --

	Otto looks up frustrated... To Junie

				OTTO (O.S.)
		I can't concentrate. Play something, my
		sweetness; my reason to rise ...

	And Junie hits PLAY on a cassette deck ... And, instantly, ENGINE
	SOUNDS rip from the shop's stereo speakers ... Otto listens, as
	if it were a Mahler symphony...

				OTTO (cont'd)
		The Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona. At Le
		Mans. 1971. The quad-cam V12. Hear
		how they got the engine up?
		Hear those exhaust notes? That's a
		very wide rev range... Here, it
		peaks at 5500 RPM...

	Memphis smiles ... These eccentricities are old hat...

				OTTO (cont'd)
		Raymond Calitri. He's amplified much
		sorrow on these streets ...

				MEMPHIS
		You think it can be done?

				OTTO
		Are you considering a comeback tour?

				MEMPHIS
		Tell me...

				OTTO
		It can be done. Take two days to shop;
		one to prep. I'll offer up my bible
		for a small fee. You also have to
		hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo
		Castlebeck's linkage so much so
		that he's setting up surveillance
		teams on every city block. And
		then get yourself a crew...

				MEMPHIS
		The hard part ...

				OTTO
		"A people is a detour of nature to
		get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then
		to get around them..." Nietzsche said
		that.

				MEMPHIS
		Is he still working here ?

				OTTO
		The old crew. Go find them. I can't
		help you with that. Since I've cleaned
		up the act a bit, they no longer come
		around... A pity how legitimacy makes
		you unpopular -

				MEMPHIS
		I Just don't know how happy they'll be
		to see me

	Otto has finished the Camaro ... He looks at Memphis --

				OTTO
		I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal.
		worst car ever built. Value job.
		Everything broke and I-fixed it.
		A coma car - built to German specs.
		Plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head.
		On a quiet night, you could hear it
		rusting in the garage. But when that
		car was gone, I missed it. If it came
		driving back in here right now,
		there'd be tears and laughter ...

				MEMPHIS
		And the moral of that story is -- ?

				OTTO
		Go to them. They'll be happy to see
		you ... Ahhh...

	And he closes his eyes ... To listen to the Ferrari tape ...

				OTTO (cont'd)
		... 8.8:1 compression...

	Borgnine tough-guy-warmth. At one time, he kicked out the 
	jams. Now he teaches driver's ed...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Pull over! Pull her the hell over!

	Jenny pulls the car over in a lopsided lurch...

				DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
		Put it in PARK. Remember how
		to do that? It's the big "Pff.

	She parks it. He stabs at the side-view mirror ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
		"Objects May Appear Closer
		Than They Seem." Can you say
		that for me?

				JENNY
		I'm sorry.

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		You ain't sorry. You're a horrible
		driver... You can't strap into
		your seat belt, without almost
		getting creamed by a bus ...

	She starts to cry... Donny softens ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
		Aw, c'mon. It's no big deal.
		You can't drive. You can't.
		Time to acknowledge it and move on. I
		can't swim. I know I can't. So you
		know what I do? I stay the fuck outta
		the pool ...

	EXT. PLEASURE CRUISE DRIVING SCHOOL - DAY

	Memphis waits outside ... The Aries K comes crawling toward him.
	Donny gets out of the car ... Sees Memphis ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Damn. Memphis Raines. Long time ...

				MEMPHIS
		How you doing, man?

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		All I get are the Orientals. They can
		build 'em, but they can't drive
		'em So? What are you doing here?
		What's with the outfit -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		You know where the others are?

	Donny frowns... Looks close at Memphis ... Then:

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Most of 'em are gone. The Dyar Boys are
		doing a nickel at Chino; Henry Santoro
		and Frankie Fish are moving
		weight in Florida; Bill Doolin was
		killed in Denver... Atley
		Jackson's on the gimp and runnin'
		errands for Calitri; The Sphinx
		is still around, I guess ... Then
		of course, there's ...

	His pause is meaningful ...

				MEMPHIS
		Forget that ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Okay. Figure it forgotten. What's this
		about anyways -- ?

	INT. OTTO'S AUTO - NIGHT

	In a wood-panelled back room, around a conference table: Memphis
	and Donny sit... With the list before them...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Most of 'em are late-model...

				MEMPHIS
		That's right. Only 10 exotics ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		We'll have to start beating the
		bushes, find out where they live...

	Otto enters. Giggles...

				OTTO
		Some crew you got ...

				MEMPHIS
		If we put out the word. That we're
		crewing-up, for a one-time-only job...
		What do you think that'll yield?

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		A bunch of strung-out hypes and stick-
		up men. This ain't like the old days,
		Memphis. The profession has lost its..

				OTTO
		Dignity...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Yeah...

				MEMPHIS
		Well, the three of us don't'exactly
		inspire confidence...

	Beat ... Donny examines the list ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Wow! They got Eleanor here -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		I know. Weird, huh -- ?

	The door opens ... One of Otto's WORKERS is there...

				WORKER
		Otto, there's someone here to --

	But they walk past: Kip, Tumbler, Mirror Man, Toby, Freb

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Lookit Kip. All grown up...

				KIP
		Hey, Donny --

				MEMPHIS
		What are you doing here?

				KIP
		Otto called -

	Memphis looks to Otto ... Otto shrugs ...

				OTTO
		You need him...

				MEMPHIS
		No we don't -

				OTTO
		I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis.
		But how are two washed-up thieves
		and an old man supposed to boost
		50 cars in three days...

				MEMPHIS
		His criminal career has officially come
		to a close ...

				OTTO
		The conundrum still applies, of course. The
		purpose of the endeavor is to rescue
		baby brother from imminent
		death and/or a life of crime. However.
		This cannot be successfully
		carried out without baby brother's
		considerable resources, shabby
		though they may be.

	Memphis considers ... He has little choice ...

				MEMPHIS
		We do this. Then. You're finished.
		Then. You're clean

				KIP
		I like how you wallop back in here -
		after four years - and can still get all
		Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...

				MEMPHIS
		You hear me?

				KIP
		I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll
		move to the country. Open a fruit
		stand...

	Memphis looks at him... Shakes his head...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		You guys have any skills at all?

				KIP
		Hell, yeah. Mirror Man here is
		our electronics expert. He's got
		some gadgets you old farts maybe
		never -heard of; Tumbler can drive
		anything with wheels, and some
		things without; Toby's a hacker,
		can do things with a computer, that
		are pretty amazing ...

				MEMPHIS
		How old are you now, Toby?

				TOBY
		Sixteen. But my birthday's in seven
		months ...

	Memphis shakes his head... Sighs ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY 
			(re: Freb)
		What about him?

				KIP
		Freb can order pizzas like nobody's
		business

	Freb starts to Protest ... Shrugs ...

				FREB
		People gotta eat ...

	Memphis looks at all of them ... Sighs...

				MEMPHIS
		Okay, then... Otto?

				OTTO
		In order to succeed, you're going
		to have to go old-school. one night
		boost. Put all your nuts in one basket.
		And...

				TUMBLER
		One night? Are you nuts?

				MEMPHIS
		You got maybe a better plan?

	Tumbler looks to Kip...

				KIP
		You spread it out ... you move around...
		So's they can't touch you... so's they
		don't know... Shadow games and shit
		...

				MEMPHIS
		"Shadow games?"

				KIP
		Shadow games ...

				MEMPHIS
		You spread it out, by the 2nd night,
		the heat are onto you. Know
		something's up. With a one-night boost,
		by the time all the cars are reported
		stolen, your ship's set sail.

	Kip and the others nod... Makes sense ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Go on, Otto -

				OTTO
		We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to
		shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still
		going to need to expand the crew...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		There's no one left ...

				OTTO
		We've got several Italian cars on the list.
		Always tricky, always timeconsuming. So
		we're gonna need a specialist ...

	Memphis looks at him. Because that's what he was afraid of.

				MIRROR MAN 
			(to Otto)
		You know of one -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Yeah. He's knows of one all right.

	So we'll PRE-LAP The Beach Boys' "409" and CUT TO:

	INT. "THE NAUTICAL MILE" SALOON - NIGHT

	A SHOT GLASS, slammed down on a bar by a surly DRUNK... In a
	mariner saloon. Drunken SAILORS and FISHERMAN and NAVY TYPES.
	Sawdust on the floor. Broken beer mirrors. A rough joint...

				DRUNK
		One more, girl -

	The BARTENDER comes over.. . She is a dark-haired, heavily 
	tattooed GIRL, 26, with the faded blue world-weariness of Roy Orbison
	song... Her name is Sara Wayland... And she goes by SWAY. She
	collects the Drunk's empty glass...

				SWAY
		I think you've had enough, Billy...

				DRUNK
		Enough? I haven't even started, girl.
		Gimme another --

				SWAY
		If you leave now, Billy, you can get
		a head-start on waking up in a pool
		of your own vomit...

				DRUNK
		Listen, you little cooze--

	And the Drunk reaches out across the bar, to grab a bottle And
	Sway grabs his hand, twists it ... The Drunk groans in agony ...
	And Sway, still clutching his hand, hops over the bar ... And
	drags the drunk by his twisted hand to the front ... Cries of
	"Attagirl, Sway!" pepper the air ...

	EXT. "THE NAUTICAL MILE" - NIGHT

	Sway tosses him... The Drunk hitting the pavement ...

				SWAY
		Come back when you've learned how to
		drink, Billy --

	And she freezes ... Because standing there, is Memphis ... She
	looks at him ... Shocked is a good place to start ...

				MEMPHIS
		See you're still stealing the sailors from
		the sea --

				SWAY
		What are you doing here?

	And she heads back inside ... And he follows her...

	INT. "THE NAUTICAL MILE"

	They head toward the bar...

				SWAY
			(re: his clothes)
		What's with the look?

				MEMPHIS
		The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting
		old...

				SWAY
		You look like you lost your sheep ...

	And she hops back behind the bar ...

				MEMPHIS
		You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's?

				SWAY
		Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in
		here ...

				MEMPHIS
		Buy you a drink?

				SWAY
		Nope. I got a coffee. And a
		boyfriend.

	She waves to a 30-year-old CAT drinking with his buddies. He waves
	back. Memphis frowns.

				SWAY (cont'd)
		Mitch.

				MEMPHIS
		"Mitch?"

				SWAY
		Mitch.

				MEMPHIS
		So I was replaced by Mitch?

				SWAY
		No. You were replaced by Alex.
		Who was replaced by Kevin. Who
		was replaced by Vince. Who was
		replaced by Mitch...

	She smiles sourly at him...

				MEMPHIS
		Wow. And to think all I
		accomplished these past six
		years was the "LORD OF THE
		RINGS" trilogy...

	She stares at him... Shakes her head... Busies herself with her
	glassware ... Beat ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		You look great --

				SWAY
		Yeah, well, you always were a sucker
		for flawed existences ...

	ANGLE - MITCH. Watching them talk ...

				SWAY (cont'd)
		You should leave --

				MEMPHIS
		On account of Mitch?

				SWAY
		On account of me.

	He studies her... Then:

				MEMPHIS
		I've taken the spear for a lot of
		people, Sway. Including you. Can't
		we improvise a little here ... ?

				SWAY
		No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ...
		You left me, remember?

				MEMPHIS
		I left town. I didn't leave you.

				SWAY
		A distinction worth noting ...

				MEMPHIS
		And here I am...

				SWAY
		Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on
		account of any longing-for-my-touch
		on your part -

				MEMPHIS
		Kip's in trouble

	And now she looks concerned

				SWAY
		What kind of trouble -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks.
		Only the two weeks have turned into four
		days. And not a single lady has been
		snared.

				SWAY
		And you got some Italians -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Six or seven...

				SWAY
		I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't
		for a while. I've carved out something
		for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...

				MEMPHIS
		I understand -

	And the cat - MITCH - comes over with two empty pitchers

				MITCH
		Another round, Sara -

				SWAY
		Sure, Mitch -

	And she goes to the tap ... Leaving Memphis and Mitch ...

				MITCH
		How you doing, pal?

	Memphis nods ... Beat. They sit there. Regard Sway...

				MITCH (cont'd)
		She's hot, right?

				MEMPHIS
		I'd go so far as to say "lovely."

	And Mitch leans over to him, conspiratorially ...

				MITCH
		You should her face when she's having
		sex --

	And Memphis turns to him...

				MEMPHIS
		Really?

				MITCH
		Really...

				MEMPHIS
		What's it look like?

	And Memphis reaches out, and GRABS Mitch's nipple, PINCHING.
	Mitch's face curls ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Is it a squinty, grimacing, contorted
		face? Agonized and writhing and ugly?
		Oh, now I see it, yes, yes!

	And Memphis releases him... And Mitch goes down hard ... And Sway
	comes over ...

				SWAY
		What the hell are you doing -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		If you change your mind. We're at
		Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours.
		For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's
		life on the felt. So long now ...

	And he's out of there, before Mitch's PALS can get to him.

				MITCH
		Who was that guy, Sara?

	She looks at the door ... Shrugs ...

				SWAY
		Good question ...

	INT. OTTO'S AUTO - LATER - NIGHT

	Memphis, Kip, Donny, Mirror Man and Otto sit around the garage ...
	Going through the list ... Tumbler calls from the next room:

				TUMBLER
		Freb's here. Open the gate.

				DONNY ASTRICKY
			(to Otto)
		We sent him out on a solo boost. See
		what he could do ...

	Freb pulls in an '89 Cadillac Coupe De Ville ...

				FREB
		How do I look in this one?

				MIRROR MAN
		Like a goofy white boy in a Cadillac.

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		How'd it go?

				FREB
		Keys were in it ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Well, that defies the point, don't it?

				MIRROR MAN
		You should ask him how he got the name
		"Freb."

				FREB
		Shaddup, man ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Get the damn thing in there and get it
		cleaned up -

	Freb pulls in. Pops the trunk. The gate is closed.

				KIP
		This is loaded with crap - get a duffel.

	He pulls out a set of golf clubs ... Freb brings over a duffel ...
	Mirror Man plucks something from the trunk ...

				MIRROR MAN (cont'd)
		Holy shit ...

	It's a plasticine BAG - full of a WHITE POWDER...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Lemme see that -

	He pierces the skin.. Tastes ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
		Heroin.

				KIP
		No shit?

	And they pull back the trunk tarp ... And there are perhaps TWO
	DOZEN similar smack-filled BAGS ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		There's gotta be a million bucks worth
		here -

				TUMBLER
		We're rich. Goddamn, we're rich!

				MEMPHIS
		Where'd you pick her up?

				FREB
		In front of one of them poker parlors in
		Chinatown ...

				MEMPHIS
		Well, take it back --

				KIP
		Take it back? What do you mean take
		it back? Are you crazy, man?


				MEMPHIS
		Take it back, Freb --

				MIRROR MAN
		Hey, now, Memphis... C'mon, man -

	Donny makes to grab the bag from Mirror Man ... But Mirror Man
	holds on ... They tug back and forth ... The bag DROPS ...
	Splitting on the ground, behind the car. Spilling heroin.

				MIRROR MAN (cont'd)
		Now, see what you--

	But a BANG! BANG! on the front gate, gives them all pause.

				OTTO
		Who is it -- ?

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (O.S.)
		Castlebeck.

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Jesus. The whole damn thing's loaded.

				OTTO
		one minute -- !

	And the others scatter into the back office, with their tools and
	devices and lists. Leaving only Memphis and Otto.

	Memphis picks up the broken bag ... Sticks it in the trunk ...
	Puts the golf clubs in on top of it ... Slams the trunk. Only
	there's still a neat MOUNTAIN OF SMACK ON THE FLOOR by the rear of
	the Caddy ... But there's no time...

	For the gate is opened. Detective Castlebeck ambles in.

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		I know you.

				MEMPHIS
		You know my back.

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		What are you still doing here,
		Randall?

				MEMPHIS
		Stopped by to see Otto. Say hello.

	Castlebeck looks at Otto... Otto grins... Castlebeck walks around
	the garage... Taking it all in...

	Castlebeck notes the Caddy ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		What's this -- ?

				OTTO
		Cadillac.

	ANGLE - the mound of heroin on the floor ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		What's wrong with it -- ?

				OTTO
		Needs brightening ...

	Castlebeck takes out a WALKIE ... Barks into it ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Run me down a tag - 329 HRO. Cadillac.

	He clicks off ... Otto and Memphis share one ... A glance to the
	smack ... Castlebeck is a mere inches from it ...

				OTTO
		No faith in our new-found goodness,
		Detective ...?

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Sure. But sometimes we got to
		create some numbers. The task force
		is run by statistics, you know ...

	Before they can respond, the radio crackles ...

				RADIO (O.S.)
		329 HRO. There's no want on the license at
		this time...

	Castlebeck looks disappointed... Otto grins ... Castlebeck stares
	at the Caddy, still unconvinced...

				MEMPHIS
		You're thinking: okay, there's no want ...
		But they probably stripped its guts and
		crated 'em up, right ... ?

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Something like that -

	Memphis opens the driver's side door ... Gestures Castlebeck in
	... Castlebeck gets behind the wheel ...

				MEMPHIS
		Let her rip ...

	And Castlebeck starts the car...

	ANGLE - TAILPIPE ... WHOOSH! All of the heroin on the flo is blown
	away by the exhaust ... Memphis winks to Otto ... Castlebeck seems
	satisfied ... Gets out.

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Okay, then. I'll catch you later,
		Randall ...

				OTTO
		Double-meaning intended, right?

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Right ...

	Castlebeck stops at the gate... Turns back to them...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		It's funny. There's probably been
		five more cars stolen in the time
		I've been here ...

				MEMPHIS
		I don't think so, Detective ...

	And Castlebeck is gone. Memphis and Otto exhale big time.. The
	others come out from the back... To find Memphis and Otto dumping
	the heroin into the sink, running the tap ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Take her back to where you found her,
		Freb --

	INT. RAINES APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Kip is in front of the TV, playing a video game. Helen Raines is
	at the kitchen table, going through a PHOTO ALBUM... Memphis comes
	home ... Hangs up his coat ...

				MEMPHIS
		Hey -

	He kisses her head ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Kip -

	Kip nods ... Plays on ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		What do you got there?

				HELEN RAINES
		The photo album. I get nostalgic around
		this time of year ...

				MEMPHIS
		What time of year?

				HELEN RAINES
		Tuesdays ...

	He smiles ... Sits down next to her ... They go through the

	PHOTOS: - childhood shots of Memphis and Kip, a younger Helen;
	Memphis at 17, in his "Ike's Garage" coveralls; 14year-old
	Memphis, an infant Kip, and their father (ROBERT RAINES) a MAN
	with bright eyes and a quiet smile, standing before an old Cutlass
	442; Robert Raines ... Outside a car dealership. We can almost
	feel his strong, sure presence ...

	Memphis looks at his mother ... As she looks at the picture.

				MEMPHIS
		You ever wonder what things'd be like
		if he hadn't died?

				HELEN RAINES
		Every day. I wonder about that every day...

				MEMPHIS
		Kip and I'd probably be working at the
		dealership...
			(to Kip)
		Imagine us selling cars?

	Nothing from Kip ... Eyes glued to the TV... Memphis glances to
	his Mother ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Imagine that -- ?

				HELEN RAINES
			(salesman voice)
		And just in case you lose your keys, good
		sir, I can toss in a complimentary slim-jim,
		free of charge ...

				MEMPHIS
		Mother -- !

	They laugh ... Look at the album ... At Robert Raines ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		I remember, every day, he'd come home
		in a different car.
		That was the greatest thing ... And
		we'd climb all over it ... Examine
		every inch of every different
		car ...

				HELEN RAINES
		I remember. Supper getting cold, cos you
		two are out there heads under hoods ...

				MEMPHIS
		You remember that, Kip?

				KIP
		I was six ...

	Memphis and Helen look at him... Then:

				MEMPHIS
		After he died ... I think that's
		what I missed most of all ... That
		there was no different cars every night ...
		When I started hanging around Otto's ...
		And he started showing me the things ...
		It was a way to kill two birds ...
		Put food on the table for you and Kip ...
		And ... Ride in different cars every
		night ... Just like when Dad was here.

	Tears stand in Helen's eyes ... Kip gets to his feet ...

				KIP
		Ancient history's two things.
		"Ancient." And "history!"

	And he walks out of the house, door slamming behind him. Memphis
	turns to his mother ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		We're gonna have to do this thing, Ma.

				HELEN RAINES 
		I know...

				MEMPHIS
		We do it. He'll get clear Once and
		for all 

	And she nods ...

	ANGLE - A PHOTO. Robert Raines. Smiling beside an Olds 98.

	EXT. INTERNATIONAL TOWERS HIGH RISE CONDOS - DAY

	The garage door opens as a resident drives out ... And Memphis and
	Donny and Kip and Toby enter the garage ... They walk along the 
	rows of parked cars ... Searching ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Car-jacking is the lazy man's boost.
		No skill. No finesse. Can only take
		the car if the key is in it. That's
		not thieving. That's parking ...
		Thugs ... With the decency of dirt ...

				TOBY
		They're just cars, man ...

	To prevent Donny from biting the kid's head off, Memphis chimes in
	with:

				MEMPHIS
		This Eleanor's been living at the
		International Towers for 3 years now.

				TOBY
		Who's "Eleanor?"

				MEMPHIS
		The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.

				TOBY
		Why do you call it "Eleanor?"

				MEMPHIS
		All the vehicles get code names.
		Female names. You say "Eleanor lives
		at such and such... " and no one
		listening on the waves is the wiser ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Eleanor is Memphis' "unicorn."

				MEMPHIS
		And there she is --

	Indeed, slotted nearby is a '67 SHELBY MUSTANG GT-500 Silver with
	black top ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Hello, Eleanor --

	And he looks at her. An old friend he hasn't seen in years.

				TOBY
		It looks just like a regular Mustang --

				KIP
		Don't go there, Toby --

				MEMPHIS
		She's not. Carroll Shelby tweaked the
		Mustang's High-Performance 289 engine
		and got it legally rated for the street
		at 450 horsepower ... But its actual
		output is closer to 600 ...

				TOBY
		So she flies -

				MEMPHIS
		She soars -

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Grade-A unicorn ...

				TOBY
		What's a "unicorn?"

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Fabled creature. You know - the horse
		with the horn? Impossible to capture?

	Toby looks blank ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
		We all got one. The single car
		that, no matter how many times
		you try to boost, something happens...
		Cops show up, car doesn't start, owner
		comes back. It's voodoo...

				TOBY
		You guys and the car thing, man --

	They head off ... Memphis turns back to the Shelby

				MEMPHIS
		See you in a few days, Eleanor --

	INT. OTTO'S AUTO - BACK ROOM - DAY

	To Queen's "I'm In Love With My Car." The crew is at work, a MAZDA
	and a CADDY are parked here for practice: Tumbler is modifying a
	series of slim jims, based on the type of cars they'll be after

	Donny and Freb are in the Caddy, Freb behind the wheel Tumbler
	puts together BRIEFCASES, containing the requisite TOOLS: slim-
	jim, gizmo, screwdriver, ratchet, dent-puller, a mini-battery with
	pointy leads ...

	- Mirror Man is showing off one of his GADGETS - beepersized
	DEVICE - to Otto... They stand before a locked MAZDA.

				MIRROR MAN
		And you just stick it in the lock.
		Hit this little button ... And ...

	He does ... The door UNLOCKS ... The car's ALARM gives a weak
	chirp and dies... Otto looks at Donny ...

				OTTO
		We're dinosaurs, Donny. Pull-up a tar pit ...
			(to Mirror Man)
		Can I try -- ?

				MIRROR MAN
		Knock yourself out --

	Kip and Memphis are with Toby, who has his laptop out ...

				TOBY
		I logged outside the G.R.A.B. site,
		right? Then I monitored their
		incoming outside data requests,
		right? Then I got these ISDN numbers,
		right? Then I tracked them back,
		right? Then I took the one I could
		jack-up the easiest, right? Then I
		called back see, they think I'm an
		insurance company - that's where it
		looks like I'm coming from -- and
		they're sharing stats with this
		insurance company, right? So now
		they're sharing it with me, right?
		They think I'm looking for stats for
		an actuarial conference on auto-theft.
		So they let me in, right? Give me all
		these numbers. But then I don't leave,
		right? I'm in. I've got the key. Now I
		just go anywhere I want.

				MEMPHIS
		So what's in there -- ?

				TOBY
		I can tell you who's gonna be on duty
		tonight. I can tell you how much gas
		they're using monthly. I can tell you
		how they used to spend that annoying
		half-hour between "FRIENDS" and "SEINFELD"...

	Memphis nods ... Fairly impressed...

				KIP
		Good work, Toby --

	Donny and Freb are inside the Caddy ... Freb's attempts to start
	it fail...

				FREB
		It just ain't happening --

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		You'll get the hang of it, kid. You
		just need to remember one thing -

				FREB
		What's that?

	Donny smiles ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		On boost night? Always take along a
		good mix tape ...

	Donny smiles ... Freb frowns ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
		You bring a woman back to your
		crib for some lovemaking, the
		song you put on, depends on the
		woman, the type of lovemaking you
		intend to do, right?

				FREB
		I guess ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		You got a school teacher or Nancy from
		accounting, you don't put on Sly Stone
		or James Brown. You put on
		Ravel. Rachmaninoff. But if you got
		some wild one you just picked
		up at the track, you wouldn't put on
		Cat Stevens or James Taylor.
		You'd put on Prince. Or Isaac Hayes.
		Or, if you really wanted to
		get after it: Miles.

				FREB
		okay ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		It's the same way with cars. Different
		cars. Different tunes. You can't steal
		a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You
		gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny
		Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that
		shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman
		Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could
		lead to disaster. Got it... ?

				FREB
			(absolutely hasn't got it)
		Got it ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Good.

	And then Sway enters ... Donny gets out of the Caddy ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
		Whoa, whoa, whoa. Memphis went out
		and got some big game ... Hello, Sway.
		I was just telling the lads about mix
		tapes --

				SWAY
			(to Freb)
		Janis Joplin. Billie Holliday. Ella
		Fitzgerald...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Gender bias ...

	Otto is before her ... Bowing from the waist ...

				OTTO
		I've missed you, Sara Wayland --

				SWAY
		Good to see ya, Otto --

	They embrace. Memphis and Kip enter from the other room...

				KIP
		How ya doing, Sway -- ?

				SWAY
		Kip...

	She looks at Memphis ... Small nod... Small smile ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		What do you think about all this?

				SWAY
		Stick it in the drawer marked "Fool's
		Errand", right -- ?

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		That's my girl --

				MEMPHIS
		That's Mirror Man ... And that's
		Freb ... And Tumbler ... And Toby ...
		Fellas, this is Sara Wayland... They
		call her "Sway."

				SWAY
		Hey -

	But the kids look high near thunderstruck ... The others laugh ...
	Go back to their work ... Memphis and Sway

				SWAY (cont'd)
		No questions. I'm here. I need the
		dough.

				MEMPHIS
		Of course ...

	She studies him... Nods ...

				SWAY
		Good. Just so we understand...

	And then she sees something at the entrance ...

				SWAY (cont'd)
		Oh, shit. You didn't --

	He follows her gaze ... To where -- A MAN, early 40s, has walked
	in. Tall, gaunt, ice-eyed. This man never speaks. And his nose is
	a gnarled blob of scar tissue ... Which is why they call him

	THE SPHINX

	And the others really don't dig his scene ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Well, well, well. The original crash
		test dummy...

	The Sphinx nods to all. Smiles warmly, but it comes out creepy.
	Freb whispers to Otto ...

				FREB
		Who's that -- ?

				OTTO
		That's The Sphinx.

				FREB 
		The Sphinx?

				OTTO
		He never says a word. And he's got
		a messed-up nose. Hence. The Sphinx.
		He's boo-koo koo-koo. But he steals like
		time ...
			(to The Sphinx)
		Hello, Sphinxy, old rum -- !

	And Otto embraces the taller man ... And the others stand
	around, offering uneasy glances to The Sphinx ...

				MEMPHIS
		Okay. We're all here. Today's Wednesday.
		D-Day is Friday night ... That gives us
		two days to prep ... We're going to find
		the ladies on our list, find out where
		they live, when they're home; that
		they're properly insured ... Let's get
		into the vans --

				MIRROR MAN
		Where we going -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		We're going shopping -- !

	We PRE-LAP Gary Numan's new-wave rave classic "Cars".

	EXT. LONG BEACH STREETS - DAY

	A MONTAGE of the hard-core old-school preparations...

	THREE MINI-VANS drive off from Otto's Auto - Mirror Man at the
	wheel of one of them - The Sphinx and Donny with him... - Freb
	drives the 2nd van: Memphis, Sway, and Kip with him... Tumbler
	drives the 3rd van: Otto and Toby with him.

	They carry pens and NOTEBOOKS ... And, as they drive around,
	they're searching out cars ... When they see an auto that
	corresponds to the list, they take down its license plate.

	Memphis dials the cell ... Mirror Man answers on the speaker in
	his van ... Tumbler in his ... We'll CROSS-CUT the scene as
	necessary from van to van ...

				MEMPHIS
		How's it going -- ?

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		It's arright ...

	They drive on ... Till --

				DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
		Check it out: 173 Firebird. Know
		who drove one of those ... ?

				OTTO
		Yes, I do, in fact. John Wayne in
		McO...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		That's being obscurest ... Who else?
		Better known. Memphis?

				MEMPHIS
		Jim Rockford. ROCKFORD FILES.

				MIRROR MAN
		For real?

	As the scenes in the vans play out - we should be INTERCUTTING

	with SHOTS of CARS ON THE STREET. LICENSE PLATES. Their NOTEBOOKS.
	As license #s are written down.

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		For real. Okay. Gimme COLUMBO...

				KIP
		Peugot convertible ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		What color?

				KIP
		Gray.

				FREB
		How you know that?

				KIP
		Remember who my brother is?

	INT. OTTO'S BACK ROOM - DAY

	Memphis and Otto go through Otto's BIBLE - an overstuffed LEDGER

	2000 cars. They look for any that correspond to Calitri's 50 ...

	INT. REGISTRY - DAY

	Donny offers the REGISTRY WOMAN a LIST of several cars from the
	shopping spree ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		I'd like the names and addresses of
		the owners of these 20 cars please...

				WOMAN
		It'll take me about 15 minutes.

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		I can wait.

	He smiles kindly at her. And takes a seat. It's that easy.

	INT. OTTO'S BACK ROOM - DAY

	Sway at the board... A grouping of three Mercedes Benz S320 are

	INT. OTTO'S GARAGE - DAY

	Otto shows Freb how to disarm an alarm system by groundingout a
	tail-light with a wire to a mini-battery...

	This dead-shorts the lights, shorts-out the alarm system, which
	chirps for a sustained second and then kills itself. The door
	locks pop open ... Otto grins...

	EXT. JIMMY'S HARBORSIDE - NIGHT

	Mirror Man in the Boxster... Parked, . He takes the KEY from
	the ignition ... And then takes, from under his jacket - a KEY

	INT. THE VANS - MOVING

	Shop and talk, part III ...

				FREB
		Okay, okay. What about MAGNUM P.I.?

				KIP
		Thanks for playing, Freb. That's a
		gimme ...

				OTTO
		Yes, but what was on the license
		plate?

				MIRROR MAN
		The license plate?

				TUMBLER
		I know. "ROBIN 1."

				OTTO
		Very good. But what was the
		significance of "ROBIN 1"?

				FREB
		Was that his first name?

				OTTO
		His first name was Thomas. Thomas
		Magnum...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Thomas Sullivan Magnum, to be exact.

	They look at Donny, impressed...

				TUMBLER
		Robin 1 ...

				MIRROR MAN
		I know! Robin was the name of that
		faggy guy who hung with him...

				KIP
		No. That was Higgins ....

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Jonathan Quayle Higgins ...

	of the Boxster, opens the glove box and grabs the

	He pays her ... Big smile ...

	INT. THE VANS - MOVING

	One more time ...

				OTTO
		Anyone? The significance of "Robin 1" on
		Magnum's license plate? Memphis?

				MEMPHIS
		Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the
		estate they lived on ...

				OTTO
		Ten points for our fearless leader ...
		Sway, how 'bout giving us the honor of
		the Bill Bixby trifecta -- ?

				SWAY
		I don't know that

				KIP
		Stumped -- !

				FREB
		Thank-God, Sway, you ain't all freaky-
		deaky, too

	But Sway grins

				SWAY
		How about: a Corvette in
		MAGICIAN; a Ford pick-up truck in
		INCREDIZLE HULK, and...

				OTTO
		Here's where it gets tricky ...

				SWAY
		... he walked in THE COURTSHIP OF
		EDDIE'S FATHER.

	Kip high-fives her... Freb looks disappointed...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Walked like a bastard... Skippin'
		stones and shit..

				OTTO
		That's a good one, Donny...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		I think so too --

	And they drive... All smiles ... All pleased with
	themselves ... And, after a beat ...

				MIRROR MAN
		Ya'll really need to get the fuck out

	INT. OTTO'S AUTO - BACK ROOM

	Sway has finished the chart ... 50 cars ... Their

	Freb is at his stereo. CDs scattered around him. Tupac.
	Biggy. Puff Daddy ... Making a mix tape... END MONTAGE.

	INT. BACCHIOCHI'S FOREIGN MOTORS - DAY

	A garage dealing exclusively in imports. Memphis enters...

				MEMPHIS
		Hello -- ?

	Sway slides out from beneath a Testarosa ... In her greasy
	coveralls, hair tied back, a motorhead's dream girl ...

				SWAY
		Hey.

				MEMPHIS
		What's wrong with her -- ?

				SWAY
		The right side of the engine is
		running richer than the left. And the
		scope isn't showing shit... I dunno... 

	And she goes to the sink...

				SWAY (cont'd)
		You know Annie's trouble

				MEMPHIS
		Annie -- ?



				SWAY
		You haven't been studying --

	She gestures to where the LIST of 50 is on the counter.

				SWAY (cont'd)
		137 Roadster. Custom. Lives at 1443
		Locklin in Rancho Palos Verdes ...

				MEMPHIS
		Right. Great car. One of a kind. I
		was looking forward to that boost
		myself 

				SWAY
		She was the only "Annie" you could find?

				MEMPHIS
		They only made a handful. We're lucky
		there's even one living in the area...

				SWAY
		Yeah, well ... She lives with District
		Court Judge Seymour Croft ...

	As she speaks we CUT TO:

	EXT. 1443 LOCKLIN - RANCHO PALOS VERDES - DAY

	A massive house of glass and steel in a fancy
	neighborhood. We MOVE FOR THE HOUSE. Over the fine-trimmed
	lawn.

				SWAY (O.S.)
		... and he keeps "Annie' in his
		living room... Like a work of art ...

	INTO THE SPARTAN LIVING ROOM...

	Massive framed Lichtenstein and Haring pieces on the wall
	... Surround the yellow ROADSTER, which sits up on a
	platform ... Check out JUDGE CROFT, a nasty fat man in his
	late 50s ... He sits in the nearly empty room... A complex
	system of directional lighting illuminates the Roadster
	...

				SWAY (O.S.)
		She's got 27 miles on her o-dom.
		Which is exactly how far away the
		custom shop was in 1979 when he
		bought her... He drove her home,
		never drove her again ...

	The judge gazes at the car, admiring its jet-pod
	taillamps... A MAID comes in with a tray of tea service
	... The maid crosses the Judge's line of sight... Watch
	as he curses her out, his face going beet red with fury...

				SWAY (O.S.)
		The man's a freak...

	INT. BACCHIOCHI'S FOREIGN MOTORS

	Sway looks at Memphis ...

				SWAY
		She's trouble --

				MEMPHIS
		I put the boys on it. They're clever
		that way...

	She nods ... Long look ...

				SWAY
		I go with you --

				MEMPHIS
		That what you want?

				SWAY
		That's what I want ...

				MEMPHIS
		Okay.

	She hits the Lava soap and starts washing the grease from her
	hands ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		I missed you, you know -

				SWAY
		You mentioned that in your letters 

				MEMPHIS
		I always thought you'd follow me up.

	She shuts off the taps ... Towels her hands...

				SWAY
		We were good when you bailed, weren't we?

				MEMPHIS
		Very good...

				SWAY
		Cos there were those dark days, when
		I figured - my God, how easy it was
		for him to just give it up; to make the
		deal; take the rot for the whole crew ...
		And give me up in the process.

				MEMPHIS
		No way ...

				SWAY
		No ... ?

				MEMPHIS
		No ...

	And he holds out a hand to her ... And she puts her greasesmeared
	towel into it ...

				SWAY
		Don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me,
		Randall. I'm the jane that was left, and
		you're the jim that did the leaving. So
		save the sanctimonious shit for someone
		who believes. The only reason I ride with
		you, is cause I don't want to spend the
		whole night with any of them other creeps!

				MEMPHIS
		Oh. Okay. Right.

	EXT. BACCHIOCHI'S FOREIGN MOTORS - DAY

	Memphis walks out... Going over to the PARKED CAR across the
	street ... Castlebeck...

				MEMPHIS
		I'm on the move -

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Your girl works in there ...

				MEMPHIS 
		Not my girl anymore

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Yet your still here ... I gave
		you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...

				MEMPHIS
		What do you want from me?

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Honestly? I want to - once every
		few months - get into my car. Pack
		a lunch. And drive on up to Chino.
		On visiting day. Bring you some
		magazines. Maybe some almond clusters.
		And see you all bright and shiny in
		your orange jumpsuit. That's what I want ...

	And with that, he starts his car ... Drives off... Memphis gazing
	after him...

	INT. VAN - MOVING - NIGHT

	Memphis drives. Kip beside him. They drive in silence. At last
	coming to:

	EXT. TEN-TON TRANSFER COMPANY - FRONT GATES

	A huge trucking company warehouse. Kip gets out. Bolt-cuts the
	chain-fence out front.

	And Memphis drives on in, passing the long rows of gargantuan
	CAR CARRIERS here. He picks one ...

				MEMPHIS
		This one ...

	He slim-jims the door ... But the ALARM goes off ... A wild
	whooping alarm ... Deafening... Try as he might, he can't get it
	off. He pops the trunk. Looks for wires ... Nothing.

	Then, at once, it goes off. Memphis turns. Kip is there. He holds
	a little DEVICE.

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		What's that thing -- ?

				KIP
		Reads the infrared. Then kills it. Little
		something the R & D department came up with ...

				MEMPHIS
		How long were you gonna let me try and
		stop it...?

				KIP
		After a while, it became a little pathetic ...
		Figured I'd put you out of your misery ...

				MEMPHIS
		Thank-you ...

				KIP
		De nada ...

	He gets behind the wheel. Pops the ignition. The truck's flipping
	stack belches. Memphis climbs in next to him.

				MEMPHIS
		Ain't we good-timing here ... ?

				KIP
		The family that steals together, deals
		together...

				MEMPHIS
		Dad'd be proud --

				KIP
		Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...

				MEMPHIS
		What era was that -- ?

				KIP
		The era when crime didn't pay --

				MEMPHIS
		As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?

				KIP
		Price of doing business...

				MEMPHIS
		What about just getting a job, 9 to 5,
		five days a week, that whole mystery
		achievement -- ?

				KIP
		It's for assholes. The Legal Buck blows,
		Memphis.  You know that. Doing this, we
		make mad bank, my boys are down, the
		girlies come around and the boosts are
		a breeze. Yeah, sure, you're gonna get
		jacked-up every now and then - but ain't
		that a small price to pay for never,
		never-ever, having to say "paper or
		plastic?"

	And he grins and puts the truck into gear. And off they go

	INT. OTTO'S AUTO - GARAGE - NIGHT

	The Replacements chime in with "Someone Take The Wheel." Memphis
	and the crew ... All but Sway are present.

	Tumbler and Mirror Man follow Memphis to one side of the shop ...
	To a window ... He gestures outside to where we see and UNMARKED
	CAR and the orange glow of two cigarettes ... Staking them out ...

				MEMPHIS
		We've got to shake them tomorrow
		night. I'm making that your problem.
		That's called delegation of duties.
		You like it -- ?

	Mirror Man and Tumbler regard the cops ...

				MIRROR MAN
		Sure, man --

	And they follow him back into the garage ...

				MEMPHIS
		Okay. Tomorrow night it's on. Each
		team has been assigned their ladies.
		The teams are: me and Sway. Donny
		and Freb. Kip and Tumbler. Mirror
		Man, you and The Sphinx ... 

	Mirror Man looks horrified ...

				MIRROR MAN
		Aw, c'mon, man ...

	The Sphinx grins at him...

				TOBY
		What about me?

				MEMPHIS
		You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto
		abreast of our progress ...

				TOBY 
		How come ... ?

				MEMPHIS
		Because you should be home with
		Nintendo, listening to The Spice
		Girls, little man ...

				TOBY
		Come on. Kip, talk to the guy

				KIP
		There's no talkin' to him --

	And Otto and Junie come out with two bottles of champagne and some
	paper cups ...

				OTTO
			(cup raised)
		To a safe and successful session of bumping
		fenders and trading paint.

	Everyone toasts ... Drinks ... Donny goes to the tape deck... Hits
	PLAY ... And "Little Deuce Coupe" by The Beach Boys BLASTS.
	("Little Deuce Coupe/You don't know what I got...")

	And all of our guys dance to it ... Singing along ... Otto dances 
	with Junie; Tumbler with Toby; even The Sphinx lipsyncs the falsetto
	parts ...

				BEACH BOYS 
		"Well, I'm not braggin,' babe So don't put
		me down But I got the fastest set of wheels
		in town, etc."

	Yes, it's the requisite rock-to-an-oldie bit ... But God, it's
	fun. As they exorcise some pre-boost jitters.  Only Kip stands
	aside from the frolic ... We watch them dance and laugh and sing
	for a bit ...

	And then Atley Jackson is there. And behind him, another Calitri
	GOON... And, finally, Calitri himself stands there.
	Someone kills the music. They all look at him... Donny and The
	Sphinx nod to Atley ...

				CALITRI
		This is how you're spending my time?
		Having a sock hop?

				MEMPHIS
		Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the
		community ...

				CALITRI
		Look at this. A multi-generational gathering
		of scumbags ...

				OTTO
		So saith the God of Scumbags --

				CALITRI
		Hello, Otto. My boys at the dock report no
		cars have yet to be delivered. And there's
		only one more night ...

				OTTO
		Getting nervous, Ray? What happens to you, I
		wonder, if delivery isn't made?

	Calitri ignores him... Looks at Kip ...

				CALITRI
		With all the free time I've had not
		counting cars as they're loaded onto
		my ship, I've managed to sand the
		cedar inside your box, Kip. This 
		will protect you from the anaerobic
		bacteria, that normally thrives in
		an airless; environment. Thus
		prolonging decay ...

	He smiles ... And Kip actually makes a run for him... Only to be
	held back by Tumbler and Donny ...

				MEMPHIS
		Get out of here, Ray --

				CALITRI
		One more night --

				MEMPHIS
		Get out --

				CALITRI
		I hope you know what you're doing. God help
		you if you don't ...

	And with that, he leaves, his goons following. Leaving our

	crew to stare after him ... And then we FADE TO BLACK...

	As a SUPER on-screen reads PART III: SWITCHIN'-TO-GLIDE

	INT. HELEN RAINES' HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY

		What are you doing?

				TUMBLER
		Watch and learn, old-timer --

	As Mirror Man points the antennae out the window ... A TOY CAR - a
	1970 HEMI 'CUDA replica ... Radio-operated, the car speeds along
	the curb outside, using parked cars as cover... She really cooks...

				DONNY
		The hell are you doing?

				MIRROR MAN
		Delivering ordnance. Y2K-style.

	ANGLE - THE 'CUDA. As it cruises along. Is stopped by a discarded
	40 oz. empty... But Mirror Man maneuvers and its back on track ...
	At last, parking jammed up to the front, right tire of DRYCOFF AND
	HAWKINGS' UNMARKED.

				TUMBLER
		The Hemi Has Landed --

				DONNY
		Big deal. Now what?

				MIRROR MAN
		What we call: fun and shit.

	And he hits a button on his radio control ... ANGLE - the model
	'Cuda. Wedged in front of the tire. As a quartet of thin steel,
	razor-tipped SPIKES thrust out from the Shaker hood ... A fraction
	away from the tire's skin ... Mirror Man and Tumbler appear
	satisfied ...

				TUMBLER

	And before the Judge can respond, they've clicked him on hold...

		Where should we put him?

		Thief Retirement Home ...

	He uses his screwdriver to REMOVE four rivets on the Mazda's
	Clubbed steering column ... In seconds, the CLUBBED STEERING WHEEL
	IS REMOVED, Club still on it. Memphis pops in the steering wheel
	he brought, jerry-bangs the rivets ...

	INT. RAINES APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Helen Raines is rooting through a crowded closet. At last she
	finds what she's looking for ... A small black boxy DEVICE. She

	... Helen sits down ... And listens... Her face clenched with
	worry ...

	EXT. SAN PEDRO WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

	Mirror Man works the thick steel door ... He's got a sledge and
	center punch... He knocks the knob off with the sledge and then
	goes to work with an ELECTRIC DRILL ...

				MIRROR MAN

	the visor mirror to apply it.

				MEMPHIS
		Gosh, no. Lipstick? What next? Mascara, blush,
		floral-print dresses?

				SWAY
		Deodorant.

	And she looks at him... She's really laid the lipstick on
	thick ... But it's oddly effective ...

				MEMPHIS
		Wow. Bozo, the very sexy clown --

	Beat. She looks out the window, throws the following away.

				SWAY
		So, you seeing anybody?

				MEMPHIS
		No. I had a girl. She was great. The
		problem is: great girls come along once
		every ten years. So I gotta wait
		another three years before I can even
		bother to look...

				SWAY
		She was so great, why'd you leave her?

				MEMPHIS
		Her parole officer strongly recommended 
		it ...

	She looks at him... But he's stopped the car... For Kip and
	Tumbler are waiting at the side of the street. They get in.

	EXT. LONG BEACH STREET - NIGHT

	Freb dead-shorts the alarm system, grounding it out on the car's
	own metal surface, just like they taught him... He's in the
	Porsche ... It's just that he can't figure out how to get her
	started ... The passenger door opens ... Donny...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		What's the matter?

				FREB
		It's all microchips and shit ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Yeah?

	He holds up a screwdriver. Jams it in the steering column.

				DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
		I don't care what kind of car
		it is. How fancy; how expensive;

		Hell, yeah... It's a beautiful business ...
			(realizes his gaffe)

	they pull in to

	EXT. SAN PEDRO WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

	Where Mirror Man is still struggling with the lock, his drills
	and punches, scattered about ...

				MIRROR MAN
		Just give me another --

	only The Sphinx shoves him aside ... Pulls the GUN from his 
	holster and BLANG! blasts open the lock...

	Mirror Man stares at the opened door ...

				MIRROR MAN
		Oh, I get it: old school.

	And Memphis and the others drive up ...

				MEMPHIS
		How's it going?

		It's going fine. The Quiet Riot and me are

	ROW UPON ROW OF GLEAMING FERRARIS

	Flashlight beams dance over car after car. It's a treasure chest
	of automotive jewels ... All of our heroes are in awe. And then a
	soft whimpering. They turn. To see Sway, overcome with emotion.

				SWAY
		It's just... so... beautiful ...

	And it is Kip that puts an arm around her ... She sobs into his
	chest ... Never taking her eyes from the array of Italian grace
	... Indeed, they are all in something of trance. Memphis is the
	first one out --

				MEMPHIS
		C'mon, gang. Let's focus. Sway, can
		you prep 'em -- ?

				SWAY
		I think so... They're just... So ...

				MEMPHIS

	The others are still gazing ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Let's go, people --

	And they set to work...

	EXT. NIGHT CLUB PARKING LOT - NIGHT

	Donny Astricky and Freb have accessed a '61 Jag... Watch as Donny
	takes out 3 screws in the Jag's ignition and removes the whole

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		So? Tell me: how come they call you
		"Freb" anyways -- ?

				FREB
		C'mon, man ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		We're partners here --

	Freb considers ... Then, reluctantly --

				FREB
		My names "Fred." You know: Frederick?
		One drunk night, I decided to give
		myself a tattoo. Hot needle it. I
		used a mirror to guide me ...

	And he pulls up his sleeve - to show the blue "FREB" tattooed
	there ...

				FREB (cont'd)
		The mirror messed me up with the "b" and
		the "d"... Everything's reversed, you
		know? Now, I'm "Freb."

	Donny chooses from a selection of IGNITIONS he's brought along.
	Finds the right one ... Installs it ... Tightens the 3 screws ...
	Starts the car with his own key ...

		Too early to tell. Nervous?

				KIP
		Nah.

				MEMPHIS
		That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous.
		Everyone's nervous. But not you...

				KIP
		I dunno. Whatever will be will be...

	magnificent power. But then Mirror Man SCREAMS -- ! With pure
	terror. For, at his feet, wrapped around his legs, is

	A BOA CONSTRICTOR - some 8-feet long... A mass of heavilykeeled
	scales shimmering on coiled muscle ... Mirror Man screams on and 
	on...

	The Sphinx swerves wildly... Racing through a red light. Barely

				SWAY
		You remember my Gramma? Yeah. I was
		thinking. If she were alive. And she
		asked me. If she came down, right now.
		Asked me. "What do you do, Sara?
		What's your life?" Innocently.
		Nonjudgemental. I think it would break
		her heart if I said I was a thief. I
		steal cars, Gramma. And even though,
		hey, I learned it all from her son.
		My Uncle Eddie. Who taught me the basics. 
		Which you refined. (You remember Randall,
		Gramma? You thought he was neat. Well,

		But ... That said... Car thieves are my

		movies.. And think about my Gramma without
		also thinking "shame on me. Shame on

	Back arched... A small moan escapes her ... Prince wails ... And
	Sway has achieved whatever kind of silly climax they aspired to
	here... She flops back down... Looks at him...

				SWAY
		You're still quite the boost, Randall
		Raines ...
			(he shrugs)
		Except now I've been chopped, and my

	Freb turns back

				DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
		Take Laura with you, you stupid shit!

	Freb blinks. Nods. Oh, yeah. He climbs into the Bentley Drives off...
	As the CRUISERS pull up around him... And the UNIFORMS getout, guns
	drawn, approaching warily -

	To find Donny Astricky ... Splayed-out on the pavement ...
	Laughing at the moon ... And, as Jimi Hendrix' "Crosstown Traffic"
	BLASTS ON TRACK, we CUT TO:

	of the final series of boosts ...

	1) The Maserati parked and empty. Sway breaches it.
	Expert. They drive off ...

	2) Kip and Tumbler. Clocking a VIPER. They circle it..
	It's loaded with bells and whistles and Clubs and a
	metallic voice that warns: "WARNING: YOU ARE TOO CLOSE THE 
	VEHICLE!" over and over ... Kip shakes his head ...
	Ushers Tumbler back ...

	3) Mirror Man and The Sphinx deliver an Aston Martin to the docks
	... Watch as it is driven into a container. The container loaded
	by gantry crane, onto the ship, lashed to the deck by overworked
	LONGSHOREMEN...

	4) Helen Raines. Looking out the window. Listening to
	the scanner for word of her boys...

	5) The Big Board. Female names disappearing like dust..

	6) Castlebeck and Drycoff. Cruising the streets.
	Searching ...

	7) Kip and Tumbler return to The Viper. This time, in a RAMP
	TRUCK. They raise the ramp. Tie down the Viper. A drive off with
	it, to be disarmed at a later, safer venue as it continues its
	robotic exhortation of "WARNING. YOU ARE TOO CLOSE TO THE
	VEHICLE."  Over and over again ...

	8) All our teams... Speeding toward us ... In different
	cars ... As the MUSIC FADES and we END MONTAGE

	FIGURES in the thicket surrounding the property. Memphis,
	Sway, Kip, Tumbler, Mirror Man, The Sphinx...

	Mirror Man has the mansion's ELECTRICAL BOX opened... He' going
	through the wires ... Cutting alarm, phone, etc.

	Memphis is on the cell phone... Face grim... He hangs up.

				MEMPHIS
		Donny got shot ... A jacker ...

				SWAY
		How is he -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		They got him to the hospital. He's stable ...

	Beat ... As they all reflect on this...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		On a brighter note: 47 ladies have
		checked in for their South American
		sea cruise -

	This cheers them slightly. Until, from the electrical box:

				MIRROR MAN
		Got it -- !

	And the few remaining lights of 1443 flicker and fade ... They
	regard the house for a beat ...

				SWAY
		Now what -- ?

	No one's quite sure ... They look at the house ... At all that
	glass ... Then Kip walks to their car ...

				KIP
		Pop the trunk, Tumbler.

				TUMBLER
		What for -- ?

				KIP
		I gotta get my tool --

	And Tumbler and Mirror Man look at each other ...

				MIRROR MAN
		No way, homes ...

	Too late. The trunk is popped. Kip reaches in. Comes up with, yes,
	another BRICK ... And Kip walks toward the house. Toward the vast
	windows ...

				MIRROR MAN (cont'd)
			(to Memphis)
		Ya' gotta stop him, man --

	But Kip forges on, indomitable ... Only he passes the huge glass
	windows ... Walking, instead, up to the front door ... And he
	SMASHES the brick down onto the DOORKNOB. Knocking it clean off...
	Looks back at the others with a wink. And enters the house...
	Tumbler runs after him...

	INT. 1443 LOCKLIN

	Kip walks through the dark house ... At last, coming to the living
	room... To "Annie'. He gets behind the wheel ... Her ignition is
	quick work. He's got her started, loud, in the quiet house. She
	coughs a bit; it's been a long time. Tumbler is there...

				TUMBLER
		Now what -- ?

				KIP
		Now, we go -

	And he drives her off the platform. Tumbler directs him...

				TUMBLER
		This way... This way... This...

	Her nose bumps a zillion-dollar VASE, which topples and shatters...

				TUMBLER (cont'd)
		That way...

	And Tumbler climbs in beside him... Kip drives her around the huge
	living room... And Kip punches the gas ...

	And they drive the Roadster down the hall ... And right through
	the OPEN DOOR... Driving down onto the lawn ... Up to their
	cohorts ...

				KIP
		See ya back at the ranch, kids -- !

	And off they go ... Vanishing down the street ... The others watch
	after him ... Mirror Man to Memphis:

				MIRROR MAN
		Gotta tell ya, man: since you been back?
		You've had a real calming influence on
		ol' Kip...

		He'll live. But it means your boy's

		They just faxed it to us...

	He hands Castlebeck the list. Calitri's 50. Castlebeck notes the

	When, from the back of the Jeep:

				TOBY
		I never been to the suburbs ...

	Toby is there ... Having stowed-away...

				TUMBLER
		What are you doing here, assface?

				TOBY
		Checkin' it out

	He smiles at Kip ... Kip looks at Tumbler ... Drives ... At last,
	pulling up to one HOUSE where the '98 Benz - "'Carol" lives. Kip
	parks, a half block down ... They get out ... Head for the
	house...

	And there she is. "Carol." Obsidian black. In the
	garage. The garage is open. And THREE KIDS, two boys and a
	girl. Late teens. They are standing around "Carol"...
	Drinking beer... Listening to the new Beck album on the
	car's CD player ... The folks clearly out of town ...

	Well-scrubbed, white suburban children of plenty ... The only crew
	they've ever run in is J. Crew... From the hedge, Kip, Tumbler and
	Toby watch the kids ... With equal parts fascination, loathing,
	envy... And then, the kids go inside... Leaving "Carol" exposed...

				TOBY
		I got this one...

	And before the others can respond, he moves for her. And she's
	open... Toby's in ... Butterfly popped - Gizmo in. The others start
	to get in when ONE OF THE KIDS comes out from the house. He stares
	at Toby, who freezes mid-boost ...

		Get her started, man -- !

	And Toby does... And slams her in reverse.  And they're off

	EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREETS - "CAROL" - MOVING - NIGHT

	Toby drives them out, Kip shotgun, Tumbler in the back. But the

				TOBY
		Which way's out, man -- ?

				TUMBLER
		Shit all looks the same here --

	They drive. Only up ahead, blocking the street, LIGHTS blinding...
	Are TWO SECURITY PATROL CARS - SECURITY COPS on the strong ...
	Guns drawn...

				KIP
		Shit ...

				TUMBLER
		Run it...

	Toby looks to Kip...

				KIP
		No...

				TOBY
		What am I supposed to do?

	Toby pins the gas. Straight at the block... The security cops dive
	out of the way. Except for one standing tall and FIRING into the
	windshield... Into Toby... The car swerves. Going off the road.
	Into a bank of mailboxes.

	The security guards run for her... Kip, forehead bloodied,
	switches places with Toby, getting behind the wheel ... Punches
	the gas ... Getting them out of there ...

	Toby ... Front of his shirt covered in blood ... The others gather
	around...

				MIRROR MAN
		Jesus ...

	Memphis climbs into the car ... Kip is holding Toby...

				KIP
		I didn't know... Should we take him to
		a hospital? I didn't know. I didn't.

	Toby is clearly dying in Kip's arms...

				TOBY
		Kip. Kip. Kip. Tell me: what's

	But Kip is lost ... Doesn't know what to say --

				MEMPHIS
		You're gonna be okay, Toby... You are ...
		We'll getcha fixed up...

		No ... No... No ... Tell me what's

		Call 911 -

		DO IT! NOW -- !

	And Mirror Man scurries for the phone... Toby's breathing comes
	out in short staccato bursts ...

				TOBY
		Kip... Kip... Kip... It doesn't
		feel... It doesn't feel... It doesn't
		feel... good

	He looks up at Kip. All of the light goes out of his eyes. And
	Toby is dead... Kip holds him for a beat ... Then passes him to a
	surprisingly emotional Tumbler ... Kip gets out of the car, runs
	for the opposite end of the warehouse ...

	The others are stunned... Mirror Man hangs up the phone ...
	Memphis gets out of the car ... He goes after Kip ... Finds him in
	one of the containers ... Grabs him by the collars ...

				MEMPHIS
		What did I tell you? What? What did
		I tell you?

				KIP
		I don't know. What -- ?

	And Kip looks at him... Tears fall from the younger boy's eyes ...
	And Kip looks so lost ... So like a little kid...

				MEMPHIS
		Come here --

		What?

				MEMPHIS
		Come here -

				KIP
		What?

				MEMPHIS
		Come here -

	And Kip does ... He walks to Memphis ... And Memphis puts his arms
	around him... And that's it. The floodgates open. Kip begins to
	sob. Deep, painful, racking sobs. And then:

				KIP
		I've missed you, man ...

				MEMPHIS
		I know. I've missed you, too 

	And they hold each other ...

				KIP
		Toby...

				MEMPHIS

		Toby...

	And they stay in the embrace... And then Memphis unwraps Kip's
	arms from around him...

				MEMPHIS
		Stay here. Stay here a while. I'll
		be back ...

	Kip nods, sniffles ... Memphis walks out of the container ... He
	strides up to the others ... Glances at Toby's clipboard, with all

		Kip's not clear yet. We got one more

	the busy street, Drycoff on his ass.

	Drycoff pulls up alongside him... So they can see him. But the wig
	and moustache prevent them from recognizing Memphis ... Other cars
	suffer from the pursuit ... They go careening into parked cars,

	-- Matty In The Morning -- The gang at Otto's -- The Carpenter in
	his wood shop -- Helen Raines, in front of her TV -- The chopper
	cops -- Paramedics, cops, injured motorists, fire men --
	Castlebeck and Drycoff... BACK TO

	MEMPHIS RAINES AND ELEANOR...

	Another few beats of silence ... Everyone watching ... He punches
	the gas... Ripping down to the accident site... Heading straight
	for it ... And we fear he aims to smash the site, maybe further
	injure the accident victims -

	Not our Memphis ... He's heading straight for

	THE RAMP TRUCK

	parked ass-end toward Long Beach ... Ramp down ... Memphis rockets
	Eleanor at the ramp truck's ramp... Straight on ... And the ramp
	LAUNCHES ELEANOR in glorious super-sexy-bloodpumping SLO-MO OVER
	THE ACCIDENT SITE some thirty feet in the air ... Evel-style ...

				DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
		You gotta be fucking kidding me --

	Where she lands in a crippling thud... Onto the EMPTY side of the
	Long Beach Bridge... Cheers from the gang at Otto's ... The gang
	at KISS-108 ... Memphis pulls her to a stop... Looks back at the
	scene ...

	Castlebeck squints ... Trying to see if it's his boy... Memphis
	switches the radio back on ... Matty has obliged... Wilson
	Pickett's "Mustang Sallyo ... And Memphis drives over the bridge,
	the only car going northbound... Memphis rides, daddy, rides ...

	INT. WOODBURN CONSTRUCTION - FRONT OFFICES - DAY

	A half-dozen Calitri SOLDIERS are here, answering phones, playing
	cards.

	INT. WOODBURN CONSTRUCTION - WORKSHOP

	The sliding door is open. The CASKET for Kip rests to the side ...
	Calitri uses a router to make a rabbet along the bottom frame of a
	plywood gossip bench. He senses something and turns to

	THE LOADING DOCK - MEMPHIS

	has driven up in the smashed-to-shit Eleanor ... He climbs up,
	entering the workshop... Calitri glances to the wallclock: 7:55
	AM...

				CALITRI
		Well, well. You've caused quite a ruckus ...

				MEMPHIS
		This is number 50. We did it. It's
		over Where's the money ?

				CALITRI
		Right there -

	He gestures to a Haliburton case ... Memphis opens it ... There's
	a lot of cash inside...

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		200 K. Just like we said ...

				MEMPHIS
		You should never have gotten my brother and
		his friends involved ...

				CALITRI
		But I had to. It was the only way to
		get to you --

	Memphis looks at him... Calitri smiles ...

				MEMPHIS 
		Well, now, he's clear. And you'll stay away
		from him...

				CALITRI
		I don't know about that, Randall.
		He did such a good job on this paper.
		And another one just came in ...

	Calitri goes to the FAX machine... Tears off the sheet..

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		It's an easier take. 30 cars. Two
		weeks. Most of them SUVs. Going to
		Russia. Think Kip'll be interested?

				MEMPHIS
		You don't want to even sniff at that --

	Calitri grins. But then his smile goes south, as he sees, for the
	first time -- ELEANOR -- parked out on the loading dock. And she
	is smashed-to-shit.

				CALITRI
		Well, that certainly won't do.

				MEMPHIS
		What do you mean -- ?

				CALITRI
		Look at it. I can't very well make
		delivery of that thing ...

				MEMPHIS
		You got no choice. It's over.

				CALITRI
		Fifty cars. Fifty cars by 8 AM
		Friday. Or Kip goes in that box.
		That was the deal ... Goddamn, it ...
		That was the deal ...

	Memphis is by a TABLE SAW... He flicks it on. The electric MOTOR
	rumbles, so as to obfuscate, any noise in here ...

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		What are you doing -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Tell you what I'm not doing: I'm not
		gonna let you get into my Kool Aid...

	And Memphis is on him... They go rolling about in grunts and
	groans - eddies of sawdust swirling - the NOISE of the table saw
	drowning out the sounds of combat ...

	Calitri is on top, grabbing an AWL from the floor, bringing the
	lethal point down to Memphis' face... Memphis holds Calitri's
	wrist, straining, the point inches from his eye

	ANGLE - FLOOR SOCKET - right above Memphis' head. With a last
	gasp, Memphis misdirects the awl so it STABS THE FLOOR SOCKET - a
	small CLAP OF VOLTAGE shaking through their bodies, as they sprawl
	akimbo ...

	Both men are momentarily paralyzed as the electricity sorts itself
	out inside of them... Calitri is up; and he's found the gun ...

	He crawls over to Memphis, climbing on him, sitting down hard on
	the younger man's chest ... But then Memphis grabs him by the hair
	and tosses Calitri off him ... Memphis POUNDS Calitri's head into
	the floor ...

	Once, twice. Three times. Calitri is out ... Memphis gets to his
	feet, nose bloody. He catches his breath. Only the door opens ...
	And Atley is there ...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Jesus, man ... What'd you do?

				MEMPHIS
		My version of "take this job and shove
		it..."

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Are you crazy? You throw down with The
		Carpenter? You got a grudge against
		your life?

	But before Memphis can respond, there are APPROACHING ENGINE
	SOUNDS from up the alleyway -- as A PANEL VAN arrives. Memphis and
	Atley look at the wall-clock. 8:05. A glance to the unconscious
	Calitri ...

				ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd)
		Now you done it. And with you
		gone - who'll save Kip the next
		time ... ?

				MEMPHIS
		This is all about there not being
		a next time, Atley --

	And the two men hold the look... And the van doors slam, as Digger
	and Butz, Calitri's grave-diggers, get out ... Atley goes to the
	unconscious Calitri ... And he picks him up, straining under the
	dead weight ... Dragging the don over to

	THE OPEN CASKET - One final burst of strength and Atley drops
	Calitri into the casket... Slamming the swell top lid of the
	coffin. He turns to look at the shocked Memphis -- As Digger and
	Butz are there -

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Hello, boys -- !

				DIGGER
		Hey! What happened? Did they make it

				ATLEY JACKSON
		They did not. A tragedy.

				DIGGER
		Mr. C. around?

				ATLEY JACKSON
		He's napping. He said to take it away...

	Atley gestures to the coffin. And they pick it up, move it to the
	van...

				DIGGER
		That'll do ya. Tell Mr. C. we was by.

				MEMPHIS
		Absolutely.

	And they are gone ... And Atley turns to Memphis

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead, right?

				MEMPHIS
		Point-five ...

	And he holds out his hand ... And they shake ...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Get outta here, Memphis --

	And Memphis does ... Nods to Atley...

				MEMPHIS
		Thank you...

	Atley nods ... Memphis walks out to the loading dock... Atley
	watches him go ...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Hoo-boy.

	EXT. CALITRI'S WORKSHOP - LOADING DOCK

	Memphis walks to the battered Eleanor ... As Pearl Jam's
	"Rearviewmirror' crunches and a CAR comes motoring up to him. It's
	ANOTHER 167 SHELBY. ANOTHER ELEANOR, a "For Sale" sign pasted on
	the back window. It's being driven by Kip...

				MEMPHIS
		What are you doing here?

				KIP
		I saw her get smashed-up on the TV.
		Knew there was no way he was gonna
		accept her ...

				MEMPHIS
		Where'd you find this one?

				KIP
		Ya gotta keep tabs on your "Eleanors",
		Memphis. Cos you never know when
		you're gonna need one --

				MEMPHIS
		You boost her -- ?

				KIP
		Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn.

				MEMPHIS
		Move over ...

	Kip does. Memphis gets behind the wheel. Drives...

	EXT. LONG BEACH BOULEVARD - DAY

	Memphis drives... Kip beside him...

				MEMPHIS
		You okay -- ?

				KIP
		I dunno ... I keep thinking about
		him.

	Memphis nods. But then FLASHING LIGHTS behind them ... An UNMARKED
	with Code 3 capabilities - lights & sirens ... Memphis considers
	... He could make another run ... But the looks at Kip... Enough
	is enough ... He pulls over ...

				KIP (cont'd)
		What are you doing? You can outrun
		him...

				MEMPHIS
		It's over. The dumb shit is over ...

	The unmarked pulls up behind him... The cop comes over ... It is,
	of course, Detective Castlebeck.

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		I know you.

				MEMPHIS
		You know my back.

	Castlebeck opens his coat... Showing stuffed holster ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		It's finished, Randall. Get out of
		the car... You, too, kid...

	Memphis starts to get out. When Castleback's RADIO crackles.

				RADIO (O.S.)
		We have suspect vehicle matching description
		at the Woodburn Scrap and Metal ... Repeat:
		the suspect vehicle has just been
		apprehended at the Woodburn Scrap and Metal,
		190 Street and Campanza ...

	Castlebeck frowns, goes to his radio. Memphis looks at Kip.

				KIP
		I reported it ...

	Memphis is impressed...

				MEMPHIS
		Not bad

	ANGLE - CASTLEBECK at his car, on the radio ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Dispatch, what's the license on
		the suspect vehicle... ?

				RADIO (O.S.)
		License is California 6-1-4 HSO. Repeat:
		California. 6-1-4 Henry Sam Ocean.

	And Castlebeck looks at the license on this Eleanor... A vanity
	plate that says - MY 67 ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		10-4.

	And he goes back over to Memphis ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (cont'd)
		Looks like we live to fight another
		round. You're free to go ...

	Memphis can barely believe it. Castlebeck leans down, to Kip:

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (cont'd)
		Your brother's a clever man and a
		talented thief, Kipling. But as role
		models go, you should observe the man,
		not the thief ...

				KIP
		Yes, sir ...

	Castlebeck sighs...

				MEMPHIS
		Don't look so glum, Detective. It's a
		beautiful day, the birds are singing,
		and there's a container ship on
		Pier 14, that's guaranteed to bring you glee ...

	Castlebeck nods ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		I want you gone, Randall. Settle your
		affairs. Make it right with those you
		love. Hell, take 'em with you. But I
		want you out of here. Out of here for
		good this time ...

				MEMPHIS
		Consider me gone, Detective --

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		I'll catch you later, Randall --

				MEMPHIS
		Double-meaning intended --

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		You betcha --

	And Memphis races off ...

	EXT. OTTO'S SALVAGE - DAY

	Otto, The Sphinx, Tumbler, Freb and Mirror Man are sipping coffee
	and eating donuts ... They are exhausted... Memphis and Kip pull
	up in Eleanor... He hands Otto the briefcase. Otto opens it... All
	that cash...

				MEMPHIS
		Split it up. Any word on Donny?

				OTTO
		He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.

				MEMPHIS
		What happened to Sway?

				OTTO
		She left...

	He nods ... The boys are huddled together...

				MIRROR MAN
		Poor Toby, man...

	A few beats of silence as they remember; then shockingly:

				THE SPHINX 
		If his premature demise has, in some way,
		enlightened the rest of you as to the
		grim finish below the glossy veneer of
		criminal life, and inspired you to change
		your ways, then his death carries with it
		an inherent nobility. And a supreme
		glory. We should all be so fortunate.
		You can say 'Poor Toby." I say: "Poor us.."

	They all stare at him, stunned...

				FREB
		You spoke

	The Sphinx shrugs...

				TUMBLER
		Say something else, man

	But The Sphinx lapses back into his silence ... Nibbles a donut
	... Sips coffee ... Memphis smiles ... He takes a stack of bills
	from the briefcase... To Kip:

				MEMPHIS
		You remember where you got this
		Eleanor -- ?

				KIP
		Sure, man --

				MEMPHIS
		She's for sale. They're asking forty thousand.
		Give 'em sixty ...

	And he hands Kip the cash ...

				KIP
		You want me to buy her?

				MEMPHIS
		Shocking, huh? We're clear now. It's done.
		I've never actually paid for a car. I want
		to see what it feels like

	Kip nods ... Memphis looks at a grinning Otto ...

				OTTO
		Dinosaurs. All of us. The Ice Age is
		now...

				MEMPHIS
		I'll see you soon --

				KIP
		Where you off to -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Thought I'd go for a ride -

	He smiles. The others do, too. Memphis heads for Eleanor.

				KIP
		Hey, Memphis -- ?

	Memphis turns back...

				KIP (cont'd)
		I'll see you, right?

	Memphis nods ...

				MEMPHIS
		You'll see me ...

	And we PRE-LAP Sammy John's "Chevy Van" and CUT TO:

	INT. BACCHIOCHI'S FOREIGN MOTORS - DAY

	Sway, underneath a Daytona... We only see her from the waist down
	... Hands on her waist ... Pulls her gently out. Memphis. He
	brings her to her feet ...

				SWAY
		What are you doing... ?

				MEMPHIS
		Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?

	And he uses a rag to tenderly wipe a small black smear of oil from
	her cheek...

				SWAY
		I can't. I got a back load of repairs
		and one of the mechanics called in
		sick and I haven't slept and--
			(stops short; sees the new Eleanor
			outside)
		Where to -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		I dunno. I know a place.

	She looks at him... Long and hard...

				SWAY
		This time it's for real?

				MEMPHIS
		Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.

	EXT. BACCHIOCHI'S - DAY

	And Memphis opens the passenger door for her ... And she gets
	in... And she smiles ... And Memphis climbs behind the wheel. He
	neutral-drops Eleanor, chirping off ...

	EXT. CONTAINER SHIP - LONG BEACH HARBOR - DAY

	As two TUGS guide the giant freighter away from the docks ... All
	those containers ... Filled with cars ... But here comes a COAST
	GUARD CUTTER ... Churning for the ship ...

	Detectives Castlebeck and Drycoff on the deck ... Stopping this
	one cold...

	EXT. LANDFILL - RHODE ISLAND - DAY

	A vast expanse of trash and garbage and layers of earth. Deserted,
	except for THE PANEL VAN parked dead center. Digger and Butz slide
	the casket from the van, parked before an ALREADY DUG GRAVE.

	As they move the casket, a KNOCKING from inside. A POUNDING. And
	muffled CRIES. Digger and Butz exchange a horrified glance... They
	stare at the casket, spooked.

				BUTZ
		Do you believe this?

				DIGGER
		What should we do?

				BUTZ
		We gotta do what we gotta do --

				DIGGER
		Shit. I hate the screamers, man. Why
		can't he finish the freakin' job?

				BUTZ
		Forget about it. Occupational hazard,
		Digger. C'mon...

	And just as we think they're sure to open it -- they DROP THE
	CASKET INTO THE HOLE -- !

	And begin to dump shovelfuls of earth upon it; its unseen occupant
	thumping and pounding and yelling -- And soon the casket is
	covered in dirt. Gone.

	And we PRE-LAP The Turtles' pop gem "Eleanor" ("You got a thing
	about you/I just can't live without you/I really want
	you/ Eleanor near me...")  CUT TO:

	EXT. THE 405 FREEWAY NORTH - ELEANOR - MOVING - DAY

	Memphis driving. Sway riding shotgun. Long Beach at their backs
	... Memphis looks quite enthralled behind the wheel... He loves
	driving this car. Sway watches him. He feels it --

				MEMPHIS
		What -- ?

				SWAY
		Nothing. Just that if I was less
		secure, I might think you were more
		into Eleanor than you are me...

				MEMPHIS
		She does have one thing you don't.

				SWAY
		What's that?

				MEMPHIS
		Bench seats.

	And he grins ... Pats the seat beside him... And Sway slides
	close... He throws his arm around her ...

	And off they go ... As The Turtles' ("Eleanor/Gee, I think you're
	swell/And you really do me well/You're my pride and joy, etc.")
	SING ON... And we hear:

				MEMPHIS (O.S.)
		You like bingo -- ?

	And Eleanor drives away from us ... Into the searing horizon line
	... Becoming just another single, yellow dot in the pointillist
	pattern that is the American road.

	THE END

          FADE IN:

          INT. CHURCH

          We're at the funeral of Dorothy Kowalski. In attendance
          are mostly old folks, their offspring and several bored
          teenagers.
          WALT KOWALSKI stands towards the front of the church. He
          speaks to an older MAN in a bulky, out-of-date suit.

          OLDER MAN
          I'm real sorry about Dorothy,
          Walt. She was a real peach.

          WALT
          Thanks for coming, Al.
          Walt Kowalski looks young for his age. He has slate blue
          eyes, physically fit and has had the same buzz cut
          hairstyle since getting out of the military in 1953.
          Walt is also a perfectionist. Nothing escapes his
          hawklike eyes, eyes that pierce and judge.
          Walt looks around at how the young people have dressed at
          his wife's funeral. His eyes narrow at his
          GRANDDAUGHTER's belly button ring.

          WALT
          Jesus Christ.
          Walt's two sons, MITCH and STEVE, watch their father from
          across the pews.

          MITCH
          Look at the Old Man glaring at
          Ashley. He can't even tone it
          down at Mom's funeral?

          STEVE
          What do you expect? Dad's still
          living in the 50s. He expects
          his granddaughter to dress a
          little more modestly.

          MITCH
          Yeah, well your kid's wearing a
          Timberwolves jersey. I'm sure Dad
          appreciates that.

          STEVE
          My point is that there's nothing
          anyone can do that won't
          disappoint the Old Man.

          (CONTINUED)

          PAGE 3
          It's inevitable. That's why we
          stopped doing Thanksgivings; the
          deal with the boat motor, the
          broken bird bath, it's always
          something.

          MITCH
          What are we going to do with him?
          Don't you think he'll get in
          trouble by himself over in the old
          neighborhood?

          STEVE
          Why don't you have him move in
          with you?

          MITCH
          Ha ha.

          INT. CHURCH - LATER


          The choir sings the Beatitudes.
          Walt looks around disgustedly at the people gathered as
          one woman looks through her day planner, an old guy dozes
          and his Granddaughter Ashley applies nail polish.
          FATHER JANOVICH, the very young parish priest, steps up
          to the altar and delivers the eulogy for Walt's wife.
          Walt sits ramrod straight and listens to the thin, weak,
          unconvincing words of Father Janovich.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          Death... is often a bittersweet
          occasion to us Catholics. Bitter
          in the pain it causes the deceased
          ... and their families. Sweet to
          those who know the salvation that
          awaits them. And some may ask,
          what is death. Is it the end? Or
          is it the beginning? And what is
          life? What is this thing we call
          life?

          WALT
          Jesus.
          Walt coughs. He takes a handkerchief and wipes his lips.
          He looks down and notices a speck of BLOOD on the white
          cloth.

          CONTINUED:


          INT. WALT'S HOUSE - SAME TIME

          The house is crammed with people following the service.
          Walt doesn't know what to do with himself. He has to
          keep busy. Steve steps over to his father.

          STEVE
          A lot of people showed up after
          the service.

          WALT
          Yeah, well, I s'pose they knew
          there'd be plenty of ham. I think
          I'll go downstairs and get some
          more chairs.

          STEVE
          I'll do it, Dad.

          WALT
          Naw, we need them now, not next
          week.

          INT. CELLAR - SAME TIME

          Grandsons JOSH, DANIEL and DAVID look through boxes in
          the cellar. A box of old Korea War photos are pawed
          through.

          Josh holds up a black-and-white PHOTO -- a young WALT
          looks utterly exhausted, behind him six bodies are
          sprawled dead on the ground.

          DAVID
          Is that Dad?

          DANIEL
          No, it's Grandpa Walt.
          Josh turns the photo over and reads it...

          JOSH
          Third Platoon, E company, March
          second, 1952, Korea.'

          DANIEL
          Where's Korea?

          JOSH
          Hell if I know?
          David holds up a MEDAL.

          3.

          (CONTINUED)

          PAGE 5

          DAVID
          Cool, I found a medal.
          They hear someone coming downstairs. By the time Walt
          descends the staircase, the boys sit on the couch,
          pretending to be doing nothing.
          Walt gives them a hard look as he grabs some chairs.

          UPSTAIRS

          5

          5
          People eat and chat. Ashley marches over to her parents,
          KAREN and Mitch.

          ASHLEY (GRANDDAUGHTER)
          How long do we have to stay, this
          ghetto is a dead zone for my cell
          and I'm bored.
          Walt stands behind them with an armful of folding chairs,
          he overheard his Granddaughter. Mitch and Karen are
          embarrassed.

          MITCH
          Ashley, honey. Why don't you help
          Grandpa Walt with the chairs?

          ASHLEY
          Me?

          KAREN
          Yes you.

          ASHLEY
          Grandpa Walt, can I help you with
          the chairs.

          WALT
          I'll take care of it, you just
          painted your nails.
          Walt opens the folding chairs and looks out the window.
          It's snowing. Walt puts on his coat, he almost looks
          relieved to get out of the house.

          WALT
          I'd better salt the sidewalk
          before someone falls and breaks a
          hip.
          Walt taps the floor with his boot and DAISY, his very,
          very, very old DOG follows him outside.

          4.

          Walt carefully shovels his sidewalk. He deliberately
          stops at the boundary of his property.
          The reason for this is that Walt's neighbors are now
          mostly Asians who moved into the house that once belonged
          to Polish families.
          Next door to Walt's house some sort of party is going on.
          Walt can see through the window that the living room is
          jammed with at least forty people, all Asians, all Hmong.
          And this is a problem for Walt, because Walt is a full-
          blown, unrepentant racist.
          Walt lights a cigarette and speaks to his dog, Daisy.

          WALT
          Jesus Christ, how many swamp rats
          can they cram into a living room?
          Walt spits in the snow and walks back to the garage.

          Walt steps inside and catches Ashley sneaking a
          cigarette. She has pulled back the canvas tarp that
          covers his pride and joy, his beloved 1972 GRAN TORINO.
          The Gran Torino is in mint condition. It has been babied
          since the day it rolled off the line.
          Ashley tosses her cigarette when she sees Grandpa Walt.

          ASHLEY
          Wow, Grandpa, when'd you get the
          vintage car?
          Walt looks at her for a second, then steps on her still
          burning cigarette before answering.

          WALT

          1972.

          ASHLEY
          I never knew you had a cool old
          car.

          WALT
          It's only been in here since
          before you were born.

          Walt lights up a smoke --

          WALT
          Jesus, Joseph and Mary.
          Walt pulls the cover back over the Gran Torino.

          ASHLEY
          Then what about that super cool
          retro couch in the den, I'm going
          to State next year and I don't
          have, like, any furniture?
          Walt walks out without commenting.

          The doorbell rings and Walt opens the door. Standing
          there is TAO, a sixteen-year-old HMONG boy. Walt scowls.
          TAO is slight, he has long hair, long lashes, but is very
          good-looking -- like an Asian Johnny Depp.

          WALT
          Who the hell are you?

          TAO
          (very quietly)
          I'm Tao, I live next door.

          WALT
          What?! Speak up, boy, get the
          shit out of your mouth. What do
          you want?

          TAO
          Do you have jumper cables? My
          uncle's car is old and...

          WALT
          No. And have some goddamned
          respect, zipper head, we're
          mourning over here.
          Walt slams the door in Tao's face.
          Walt turns and is suddenly cornered by Father Janovich.
          Walt hates situations like this.

          Mr. Kowalski.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          Huh?

          WALT
          It's Mr. Kowalski, not Walt.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          Right, Mr. Kowalski. Your wife
          and I became quite close these
          last few months. She asked that I
          watch over you when she passed on.
          I told her I watch out for my
          entire flock, but she made me
          promise I'd keep an extra sharp
          eye on you.

          WALT
          I appreciate your kindness to my
          wife and now that you've spoken
          your piece, why don't you move on
          to the next sheep?
          Walt starts to step away, but Father Janovich blocks him.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          Dorothy mentioned specifically
          that it was her wish for you to go
          to confession. She said she
          couldn't remember the last time
          you went.

          WALT
          Is that so?

          FATHER JANOVICH
          It is.
          Walt drains his lowball glass.

          WALT
          Well, I confess I never much liked
          church and only went because of
          the wife. And I confess I have no
          desire to confess to a boy who is
          fresh out of the seminary.

          People are leaving Walt's house. A mass of shuffling,
          stiff-jointed old Pollacks.
          Right next door -- walking the opposite direction are
          more Hmong going up the sidewalk. They laugh and chatter
          and carry big dishes of food and fruit. They are a happy
          bunch compared to the dour crowd exiting Walt's home.
          The Hmong are going to a birth ceremony. A three-day-old
          baby is named and three souls are located for the
          newborn.

          CUT TO:

          ANOTHER ANGLE
          Walt leans over a car that contains two shivering old
          ladies from the funeral. He hooks up the jumper cables
          to their dead battery.
          Mitch, Karen, Ashley and Josh pull up next to Walt in a
          brand new Toyota Land Cruiser. Mitch opens the window.

          MITCH
          I'd really like to help, Dad, but
          we have to get the kids home,
          they're getting restless.
          Walt just looks at the TOYOTA EMBLEM on the Land Cruiser
          and then gives Mitch a disgusted glance.

          WALT
          Fine. Go.

          MITCH
          I'll call in a few, see how you're

          Walt gets his guests' engine running.
          As they drive off, Walt hears faint SINGING. Walt looks
          into his neighbor's backyard and can't believe his eyes.
          The Hmong all sing and chant as three CHICKENS have their
          heads sliced off, right there in the yard.
          The chickens are held up and everyone chants louder.
          It's a sacrifice. Walt spits in the snow and says to
          Daisy.

          The house is a buzz of activity. The older Hmong speak
          their native language, the younger generation speaks both
          English and Hmong.
          (NOTE: Hmong is subtitled when necessary.)
          Tao's Grandmother (PHONG) complains to a MAN.

          PHONG

          (SUBTITLED)
          There's no man in this house,
          that's why my daughter should
          remarry. Being a second wife is
          better than having a woman be the
          head of the household. It's not
          our way.

          his sister gives him orders and he
          obeys.
          The CAMERA PANS TO the kitchen where TAO washes a pile of
          dishes. An older relative drops dishes in the sink,
          without acknowledging Tao's presence. It's clearly an
          insult.
          In the LIVING ROOM the Hmong Soul Calling ceremony
          starts its next phase. An elder, the family SHAMAN, is
          present and begins the ritual.
          As the entire Hmong family gathers to watch. Tao slips
          on his coat and goes out the back door.

          contact as Tao passes.
          Walt spits in the snow and looks down at Daisy.

          WHAM! A HOCKEY STICK is thrown through the spokes of his
          front wheel. Tao flies over the handlebars into the
          snow.
          A chorus of laughter is heard. Three LATINOS stand
          around the stunned, prone Tao.

          HEAD LATINO
          Whatta you gonna do, gook? You
          gonna Kung Fu' us?
          Tao just lies there as Latino #2 picks up his bike.

          LATINO #2
          Surprised it ain't a girl's bike.
          The Latinos laugh. Tao remains on the ground.

          HEAD LATINO
          You gonna get up or what?
          Tao doesn't move.

          HEAD LATINO
          Tell you what, I'll let you take
          the first swing. You drop me and
          you can have your bike back.
          Tao smiles, he can't help it.

          HEAD LATINO
          What the fuck you smiling at,
          gook? Something funny?
          He grabs Tao by the jacket and pulls him to his feet.

          HEAD LATINO
          You better get the fuck outta
          here, bitch.
          He pushes Tao backwards. Tao falls back into the snow.

          Walt's property is perfectly kept, whereas his neighbors'
          houses are rundown.
          Walt's eyes linger on every defect, gutter hangs, ripped
          screen doors, peeling paint. One neighbor has installed
          a chicken coop.
          Walt looks down at Daisy --

          Damn chinks let their yards go to

          behind him.
          The blue Chevy is now parallel with Tao and keeps pace
          with his step. Tao looks over to the occupants of the
          Chevy.
          It's two LATINOS. Tao quickens his pace, but the Chevy
          easily keeps up with Tao.

          That's right, you keep walking.

          Latinos. SPIDER, the driver, squints and then points at

          Oh goody, more Rice Niggers.
          The Latino Driver smiles and flashes a PISTOL.
          A Hmong kid in the back seat opens the door and displays
          a sub-machine gun. The Latinos are way out-gunned.

          LATINO #2
          Fucking Viet Cong swamp rats. Go
          back to your fucking rice paddy.
          The Latinos screech their tires and are gone. The Hmongs
          in the car smile and congratulate themselves.
          Tao simply keeps walking down the street!

          SMOKIE
          Where the fuck does he think he's
          going? Turn us around and go
          after that cousin of yours.
          They swing a U-turn and pull up to Tao, keeping pace with
          him as he walks.

          SPIDER
          Hey, cuz, slow down, where you
          going? You should really think
          about hanging with us, man. If we
          all stick together, shit like that
          won't happen, with those Spicks.
          Tao nods as he walks, but doesn't answer.

          SPIDER
          You can't be such a little girl.
          You join up with us, we'll keep
          you out of trouble, cuz.

          Tao looks at the sub-machine gun cradled by the Hmong
          gangbanger in the back seat.
          Smokie takes this all in. He looks down the street and
          sees that in a half block, Tao will have to pass a group
          of Latino gangbanger types.

          SMOKIE
          You think about it and we'll see

          Tao digs in the garden. Tao's younger sister SUE sits
          and reads JANE magazine on the porch.
          The tricked-out Honda with Blue Neon lights pulls up.
          Spider, Smokie and two other Hmong gangbangers get out.

          SPIDER
          Hey, cuz. Hey, Sue.

          SUE
          What do you want?

          SPIDER
          Came to talk to my cousin Tao.
          Smokie looks over to Sue.

          SMOKIE
          Spider, who's the other cousin?
          SUE laughs at the name Spider. Sue is seventeen, has
          long straight hair with red highlights.

          SUE
          Spider'? Is that what he just
          called you, Fong?

          SPIDER
          This is my little cousin, Sue.
          Smokie takes off his sunglasses and smiles at Sue.

          SMOKIE
          Hey, Sue... how old are you, girl?

          SUE
          Mentally, I'm way too old for you.
          I'm going inside.

          men talk.

          SUE
          Yeah, that's exactly what I'm
          doing, Fong.
          Sue rolls her eyes and goes inside. Smokie stares at
          Tao.

          SPIDER
          You think about what we talked
          about?
          A PAUSE. Smokie watches Tao carefully, offers him a
          cigarette. Tao shakes his head no and looks at the
          ground.

          SMOKIE
          That's exactly the point, Tao.
          Spider told me how everyone thinks
          you're a pushover, how everybody
          walks all over you and shit. I
          mean, look at you, out here
          working in the garden like a
          woman.
          Tao nods silently, but still looks at the ground.

          SMOKIE
          It ain't no big thing. You just
          need a little guidance.
          Tao looks up at Smokie. Tao looks a little skeptical.

          SMOKIE
          It's true, man. Shit, I used to
          be kind of a quiet little punk
          like you, everybody fucking with
          me. But finally I said no more.'
          You, you're lucky, Tao, we got
          your back. Me? I didn't have
          nobody. Had to mold my own tribe.

          SPIDER
          Smokie's right. We're family,
          right? You with us or what?

          SMOKIE
          I swear, brother, we're the best
          friends you'll ever have. And
          anyone fucks with you, they're
          fucked.

          TAO
          What do I have to do?
          Smokie points to Walt's open garage.

          SMOKIE
          Spider mentioned that neighbor of
          yours.

          ZOOM IN -- There it sits with the tarp rolled back,
          Walt's gorgeous, shining GRAN TORINO.

          SMOKIE (O.S.)
          Now that's a car.

          Next to the garage, Walt is bent over planting tomatoes.
          Walt notices the Hmong punks looking at him.

          Walt sits at the bar in the VFW (Veterans of Foreign
          Wars) drinking with the old buddies and cracking off-
          color jokes.

          WALT
          I got one. A Mexican, a Jew and a
          colored guy walk into a bar, the
          bartender looks up at them and
          says -- get the fuck out.'
          The gang laughs, until they see Father Janovich step up
          to the bar. He smiles as he recognizes several faces.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          So, here's where my flock
          congregates when they're not in
          church.

          DARREL
          Hello, Father.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          Hi, Walt.
          Walt says nothing. He just sips his beer.

          DARREL
          What brings you in here, Father?
          The meat raffle?

          FATHER JANOVICH
          No. I came down to talk to Walt,
          if that's okay.
          Mel and Darrel look at Walt. It puts him on the spot.

          WALT
          I have to hand it to you, Padre.
          You are persistent.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          I promised your wife.
          Walt looks over at Mel and Darrel and then back at Father
          Janovich.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          I'll have a Diet Coke.

          The waitress leaves.

          WALT
          So, what do you want?

          FATHER JANOVICH
          I promised your wife I'd get you
          to go to confession.

          WALT
          Jesus Christ, why'd you do that?

          FATHER JANOVICH
          She was very insistent. She made
          me.

          WALT
          You sure are fond of promising
          people stuff you can't deliver on.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          Let's talk about something else.

          WALT
          Like what?

          FATHER JANOVICH
          Life and death.

          WALT
          What would you know about it?

          FATHER JANOVICH
          I'd like to think I know a lot.
          I'm a priest.

          WALT
          You stand at the altar and preach
          on and on about life and death
          without knowing anything other
          than what you learned in priest
          school. Everything you say sounds
          like it's out of the Rookie
          Preachers Handbook.

          WALT
          Death is bittersweet? Bitter in
          the pain, sweet in the salvation.'
          That's what you know of life and
          death? Good God, it's pathetic.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          What do you know, Mr. Kowalski?

          WALT
          Plenty. I lived with death for
          three years in Korea. We shot
          people, we stabbed them with
          bayonets, we hacked seventeen-year-
          old kids to death with shovels,
          for Christ's sake. I did things
          that won't leave me till the day I
          die, horrible things, things I
          have to live with.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          And what about life?
          Walt has to think for a second. He struggles with his
          answer.

          WALT
          Well... I survived the war... got
          married... and raised a family.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          Sounds like you know more about
          death than you do living.
          Walt downs a shot.

          Maybe so.

          Walt hears a sound and wakes up. He's very groggy, he
          had plenty to drink at the VFW.

          WALT
          Daisy?
          The dog sleeps in her bed in the corner. Walt looks at
          the clock; it's 3:48 am.
          Walt looks out his bedroom window. He sees the faint
          beam of a flashlight in his garage.

          Walt pulls on his robe, opens the closet and pulls out
          the big, 30-06 M1 Garand Rifle he took home from Korea.
          Walt slides a magazine into the top of the M1 and
          chambers a round with a loud SNAP.

          The light flips on and before he can blink, Tao is face
          to face with the barrel of Walt's M1 RIFLE.
          Walt is silent, he has one eye closed so he can better
          aim at Tao's forehead -- which is nine inches away. Tao
          drops the tool he was holding, it bounces with a loud
          metallic clang.
          Tao backs away, his eyes wide with terror. As Tao backs
          up, Walt advances, step for step.
          Tao trips over a garden hose, which causes Walt to trip.
          They both start to fall. The lightbulb is bumped with
          the rifle barrel and swings back and forth.
          As Walt hits the garage floor, he accidentally FIRES THE
          RIFLE. The bullet goes through a big, metal Hamm's Beer
          sign on the wall.
          Tao scrambles to his feet and jumps like a deer over
          Walt. Tao runs out of the garage and into the night.
          Walt lies on the floor for a second, stunned. Sweat runs
          down his forehead. He coughs up blood. The lightbulb
          still swings, casting odd shadows in the garage.

          WALT

          Spider's Honda. Spider opens the door.

          SPIDER
          Get in, get in!
          Tao runs right past him. Spider guns the motor and pulls
          in front of Tao. Smokie, Spider and another gangbanger
          get out.

          Me? Nothing. What would I want?

          I don't know. Your wife already

          jewelry.

          MITCH
          No. I was just wondering how you
          are, what's going on, anything new
          in the old neighborhood?
          Walt looks at the bullet hole in his Hamm's Beer sign.

          WALT
          Nope.

          MITCH
          Great. Smooth sailing then?

          WALT
          Yup.
          There's a very painful pause in the conversation.

          Well good... Say, Dad?

          Uh-huh.

          Walt looks up again and his eyes sweep the neighborhood
          in defiance. A couple of Hmong teenagers look at the
          car.

          chair and walks stiffly back into the garage.
          Walt flips on the outdoor light, highlighting the Gran
          Torino still sitting at an angle in the driveway. The
          whole scene looks like a mid-sixties car ad in Popular
          Mechanics.
          Walt goes in the back door and a moment later the kitchen
          light comes on. The Gran Torino remains in the driveway.
          It's a challenge, an invitation. Walt is daring the

          The tricked-out Honda drives up, but doesn't stop at
          Walt's. It pulls up in front of Tao's house. Tao and
          Sue exchange looks out on the front step.
          Smokie, Spider and two others get out, walking
          confidently up the sidewalk towards them. They grin,
          they're cocky.

          SPIDER
          Hey, cuz. What's up?

          TAO
          What are you doing here?

          SPIDER
          Be happy. We've got good news.

          SUE
          Oh really? What's that?

          SMOKIE
          We're giving you another shot.

          TAO
          I don't think so.

          SMOKIE
          You blew it the first time. We've
          got another little inauguration
          planned for you. This time
          there'll be no mistakes.

          SUE
          Another big, tough gangbanger with
          little-man' complex.
          Smokie leers at Sue. It makes her uncomfortable.

          SMOKIE
          I got my eye on you too, little
          girl.

          SUE
          Whatever.

          SMOKIE
          Come on, Tao. Let's go.
          Tao says nothing. He looks at the ground.

          SPIDER
          He said, let's go.

          SMOKIE
          Come on, man. Nobody's gonna get
          hurt. We'll take care of you.

          SUE
          Don't go, Tao.

          SMOKIE
          You mind your own business, girl.
          Two Hmong gangbangers grab Tao by the arms.
          The front door swings open and there stands a glaring
          Phong.

          I know what you are. Go away and

          SMOKIE
          That old woman's got bigger balls
          than you. You always let little
          girls and old ladies fight for
          you?
          Tao tries to squirm away. Smokie grabs him by the hair
          and opens his coat to reveal the PISTOL in his belt.

          SMOKIE
          I'm not gonna say it again. Let's
          go. Now.
          Tao is shoved towards the car.
          Suddenly -- Sue jumps on the back of one of the
          gangbangers and knocks him to the ground. Tao breaks
          free.

          SUE
          Run, Tao, run!
          Sue is slapped to the ground.

          SUE

          RUN!!
          Tao is tackled by Smokie and punched in the face. Tao's
          mother comes out the front door.
          Smokie and Spider pull Tao towards the car as the other
          gangbangers keep Mom, Grandma and Sue at bay.
          A middle-aged Hmong Man from across the street comes into
          the yard. All the gangbangers overreact and pull their
          pistols. The middle-aged Hmong Man gets in Spider's face
          and is cracked across the jaw with a pistol barrel.
          Tao back-pedals away from Spider and Smokie. It becomes
          a pushing, rolling, surging melee.
          This mess boils over and spills into Walt's front yard.

          And before anyone can blink, WALT has the muzzle of his
          big 30-06 M1 Garand Rifle pointing at Smokie's face.

          WALT
          Get off my lawn.

          SMOKIE
          Listen, old man, you don't want...

          WALT
          I said get off my lawn. Now.
          Walt's calm demeanor is unnerving to the gangbangers.
          The guns in their hands seem tiny compared to the big
          military rifle Walt holds.

          SMOKIE
          Are you fucking crazy? Go back in
          your house, old man.

          WALT
          Get off my lawn.

          Walt spits out the side of his mouth. He grins.

          Don't think for a second I won't
          blow a big hole in your face and
          it won't bother me a bit, not any
          more than if I shot a deer. Now
          get off my goddamned lawn.
          Two of the Hmong gangbangers take a step back. Walt
          senses their fear. Only Smokie holds his ground.

          WALT
          Believe me, kid, I'll blow your
          damn head off, go back to bed and
          sleep like a baby. I couldn't
          care less.

          SMOKIE
          I'm not gonna warn you again!
          Walt laughs...

          WALT
          You're nothing to me. In Korea,
          we stacked fucks like you five
          feet high and used you as

          Walt CLICKS OFF the safety on the M1 Garand Rifle.
          Smokie and the gangbangers give Walt fierce looks, but
          melt back towards their car.
          As they get into the car -- Smokie has to say something.

          SMOKIE
          You better watch yourself, old
          man.
          The Honda screeches its tires and goes off down the
          street.
          Walt looks at Tao, Sue, Mom and Grandma who stand in
          stunned silence in his front yard.
          A PAUSE. Finally, Sue speaks up...

          SUE
          Thank you.
          Walt lowers his rifle and spits on the ground.

          piled there.
          Daisy comes out and stretches on the porch, before
          putting her nose in a food basket.

          Walt carries three big bouquets of flowers to the trash.
          He dumps them on top of other gifts he received from the
          Hmongs. His garbage is overflowing.
          Coming down the alley is another Hmong couple, they smile
          carrying a basket filled with Asian vegetables.
          Walt holds up his hand like a traffic cop.

          WALT
          No. No more.
          The Hmong couple nod, say something with a smile and turn
          around.

          NEXT DOOR
          Tao, his mother and Sue argue in the yard. They gesture
          towards Walt's house. The women buzz around Tao, all
          speaking in his ear at the same time.
          Phong yells at them from the porch, but they ignore her.
          Walt watches as the mother and Sue march Tao towards his
          house. Tao looks like a whipped dog.

          WALT
          Why won't these people leave me
          alone?
          Walt walks out to meet them at his property line and puts
          up his hands, indicating they've come far enough.
          Sue holds up a plant.

          SUE
          We brought you some shallots to
          plant in your garden.

          WALT
          I don't want them.

          They're perennials, they come back
          every year.

          No. You keep them. Why do you
          people keep giving me all this

          bunch of jabbering gooks off my
          lawn.

          SUE
          Well, you're a hero to the

          No, I'm not.

          Good afternoon, Walt.

          I mean, Mr. Kowalski.

          I already told you I'm not going

          Why didn't you just call the
          police?

          Pardon?

          FATHER JANOVICH
          I do work with some of the Hmong
          gangs and I heard there was some
          trouble in the neighborhood. Why
          didn't you call the police?

          WALT
          Oh, I prayed for them to show up,
          but guess what? No answer.

          What were you thinking? Someone
          could have been killed. We're

          Not that it's any of your
          goddamned business, but when
          things happen quickly like that,
          you have to react. In Korea, we
          never called the police' when a
          swarm of screaming gooks came
          pouring into our lines. We
          reacted.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          We're not in Korea, Mr. Kowalski.
          Walt says nothing.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          I've been thinking about our
          discussion on life and death.
          About what you said. About how
          you carry around the horrible
          things you were forced to do.
          Horrible things that won't leave
          you. It seems that it would do
          you good to unload some of that
          burden. Things done during war
          are terrible, being ordered to
          kill, killing to save others,
          killing to save yourself. You're
          right, those are things I don't
          know anything about. But I do
          know about forgiveness. And I've
          seen a lot of men who have
          confessed their sins, admitted
          their guilt and left their burdens
          behind them. Stronger men than
          you. Men at war who were ordered
          to do appalling things and are now
          at peace.
          Walt nods. Father Janovich threw a bull's-eye. Almost.

          WALT
          I'm impressed. You came with your
          guns loaded, for once.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          Thank you.

          WALT
          You have balls, Father. And what
          you said, you're right. I'm sure
          stronger men than me have found
          their salvation. Hallelujah. But
          there's one thing you're way wrong

          backwards.

          Hey, girl, you come over here and
          talk to me. Come on, baby, don't
          be shy.
          Trey and Sue move as far over on the sidewalk as they can
          to avoid the black guys. They try to ignore them.

          TALL BLACK GUY
          Come on, sweetie, don't be like
          that. You talk to me, don't be
          all stuck up and shit.

          Walt waits at a stoplight. He watches Sue and Trey and
          the three black guys who block their path.
          One black guy flips Trey's VISOR onto the ground. The
          Tall Guy makes kissy faces at Sue as he touches his

          What the fuck are you doing in my
          neighborhood, boy?

          TREY
          Nothing. We're going to Red Roost
          to get some CDs. That place is
          trippin', bro.

          TALL BLACK GUY
          What you call me, you fucking with
          me, bitch? You think you're
          funny?

          TREY
          Nothing. No.

          TALL BLACK GUY
          I'm warning you, boy. What you
          all come up in here for? You here
          to bring me this present?

          TREY
          Huh?

          TALL BLACK GUY
          This Oriental yummy for me? Don't
          worry, I'll take good care of her.

          SUE
          Great, another asshole with a
          fetish for Asian girls. God, it
          gets so old.

          TALL BLACK GUY
          What's your name, girl?

          SUE
          My name? It's take your crude,
          overly obvious come-on to every
          woman who walks past and cram it.'
          That's my name.

          TALL BLACK GUY
          You should keep your bitch on a
          leash, put a choke chain on this
          whore and yank.

          SUE
          Oh, of course, right to the
          stereotype thesaurus. Call me
          whore' and bitch' in the same
          sentence.

          The Tall Black Guy grabs Sue by the arm. Trey moves
          slightly towards Sue and is pushed down into a pile of
          garbage.

          TALL BLACK GUY
          You think you're pretty funny,
          don't you?

          SUE
          What, are you gonna hit me now?
          That'd pretty much complete the
          picture.
          The Tall Black Guy pushes Sue hard against the wall.

          TALL BLACK GUY
          You don't know when to quit.
          The old, black pickup pulls up and stops next to them.
          Sue, Trey and the black guys look over.
          Walt sits behind the wheel, he looks right through the
          Tall Black Guy.

          TALL BLACK GUY
          What the fuck you looking at, old
          man?

          WALT
          You... and your buddies. What's
          the matter with you? Don't any of
          you work? I see you lazy show-
          offs in the middle of the day,
          slowly walking across the street
          or harassing women. Nobody owes
          you bastards anything so go out
          and get a job instead of pushing
          little girls around, for Christ's
          sake.

          TALL BLACK GUY
          Why don't you get the fuck out of
          here, while I'll still let you.

          BLACK GUY #2
          That's right, bitch.

          WALT
          What makes you spooks think you
          can bully a couple kids with
          impunity?

          TALL BLACK GUY
          What?! Are you fucking crazy?

          Look at me, Slick. You're crazy
          if you thinking I'm fooling
          around.

          TALL BLACK GUY
          You are fucking crazy.

          WALT
          You have to be pretty goddamned
          dumb to think you can push people
          around without running into
          someone who will push back.
          The black guys are a bit dumbfounded. Walt stares them
          down.

          WALT
          But you might just be dumb enough
          not to recognize that your luck
          just ran out.
          All bravado drains away from the black guys. Walt is a
          rock.
          Walt grins slightly and spits on the ground.

          TALL BLACK GUY
          Fuck this guy. He ain't worth it.
          The trio walks slowly across the street, forcing a car to
          miss a green light.
          Trey puts his hand out to shake Walt's...

          TREY
          Man, thanks a lot, mister.
          Walt doesn't extend a hand, he lets Trey stand there like
          an idiot. Trey slowly lowers his arm.
          Walt looks at Trey's outfit.

          WALT
          Go home, clown... and pull up your
          goddamned pants.
          Walt turns to Sue.

          Walt and Sue drive in silence. Finally Sue speaks up.

          SUE
          So, what's with you, you have some
          sort of savior complex or
          something?

          WALT
          What in the hell's the matter with
          you? I thought all you Asian
          girls were supposed to be so
          smart. What are you doing walking
          around in that neighborhood?
          That's how you end up in the
          obituaries, that is, if they can
          identify your body once they pull
          it out of the goddamned river.

          SUE
          I know, I know. Take it easy.
          Walt looks at her for a second. She's not ruffled at
          all.
          They drive.

          WALT
          So, that goofball back there.
          He's your boyfriend?

          SUE
          Yeah, kind of, his name is Trey.

          WALT
          Why in the hell would you go out
          with a clown like that. Why don't
          you date one of your... own...one
          of those other... Hu-mungs.

          SUE
          You mean, Hmong? We're Hmong, not
          Hu-mung.

          WALT
          Right. Hmong. What is a... where
          is Hmong or whatever?
          Sue laughs.

          SUE
          Wow! You're so enlightened.
          Hmong isn't a place, it's a
          people.

          China.

          WALT
          Then why are you in my
          neighborhood, instead of back
          there?

          SUE
          It's a Vietnam thing. We fought
          on your side and when America
          quit, the Communists starting
          killing the Hmong, so we came over
          here.
          Walt is quiet for few seconds.

          WALT
          Why'd you pick the Midwest, for
          Christ's sake? There's snow on
          the ground near half the year.
          Jungle people on the frozen
          tundra?

          SUE
          Hill people. We were hill people,
          not jungle people. Boo-ga, boo-
          ga, boo-ga.

          WALT
          Whatever.

          SUE
          Blame the Lutherans. They brought
          us here.

          WALT
          Still, you'd think the cold would
          keep all the assholes away.
          Sue laughs again at Walt's conscienceless racism.

          SUE
          Thanks for the ride.

          WALT
          Sure... You know, you seem okay.
          What the hell's the matter with
          your half-wit brother? He a
          little slow or something?

          WALT

          SUE
          It's really common. Hmong girls
          over here fit in better, we

          Walt drinks coffee and reads the newspaper. He flips
          from section to section. Daisy's at his feet.
          Next door, Phong sits watching Walt. He can see her
          mumbling under her breath.

          WALT
          Old hag, giving me the evil eye?
          Walt opens the paper to the TV guide section and lingers
          at the HOROSCOPES for a second.

          WALT
          Aw, what the hell...
          Walt reads aloud to himself.

          WALT
          Your birthday today; This year you
          have to make a choice between two
          life paths. Second chances come
          your way. Extraordinary events

          99.

          porch.

          What a load of crap.
          Walt lights up a cigarette and exhales.
          Walt watches as the only white woman on the block
          struggles to unload her groceries from her car. One of
          her bags rips.

          Christ all Friday. What's wrong

          Walt gets up to go help, but before he can get to the
          sidewalk, another neighbor has gone over to help...
          It's TAO. Tao bends down and carries her bags up to her
          door.

          Mitch and Karen sit across from Walt. A small store-
          bought birthday cake sits in front of Walt.
          Walt reads his birthday card. It's signed; Love Mitch,
          Karen, Ashley and Josh. ALL the signatures have been
          written in a woman's cursive style and with the same pen.
          Mitch slides a wrapped gift across the table to Walt.

          MITCH
          Go ahead, Dad. Open it.

          WALT
          What is it?

          MITCH
          Just open it.
          Walt opens the package, it's a Gopher Reaching Tool --
          the kind that has an alligator clamp so you can pick up
          objects that have fallen behind the stove, etc.
          Walt looks at his son and daughter-in-law.

          MITCH
          It's a Gopher. It's so you can
          reach stuff. You know, it makes
          things easier.

          KAREN
          Here's one from me.
          KAREN slides over a another wrapped gift. Walt opens it.
          It's a PHONE with really big numbers for old people.

          I just thought... we thought that

          Yeah, I see that.

          There's nothing wrong with making
          things less hard on yourself.

          MITCH
          Karen's right, Dad. You've worked
          hard your whole life. Maybe you
          should think about taking it a
          little easier?
          Walt lights up a cigarette.

          MITCH
          And that's another thing, Dad.
          You should get rid of the coffin
          nails.

          MITCH
          And the house, now that Mom's
          gone, it's got to be a lot to
          maintain, let alone clean... and
          you're all alone in here.
          It's worse than Walt thought. He puffs smoke.

          KAREN
          There's these great places now,
          these communities where you don't
          have to worry about mowing the
          lawn or shoveling snow. People
          who are like you, alert, active,

          To hell with him, kicking us out

          Walt looks in the refrigerator, Sue looks over his
          shoulder.

          WALT
          You do have a lot of beer, but no
          Pabst.

          SUE
          As they say, When in Hmong.

          WALT
          Ha ha. Are you sure it's okay I'm
          here? Everyone keeps looking at
          me and when I look back, they look
          at the ground.

          SUE
          It's fine.
          Phong appears from the crowd and points at Walt.

          Walt cringes at her presence.

          WALT
          What'd she say?

          SUE
          She said welcome to our home.

          WALT
          No she didn't.

          Several relatives usher Phong away from Walt. The
          relatives are embarrassed at the outburst.

          WALT
          She hates me.

          SUE
          Yes, she hates you.

          WALT
          What did I do?
          A little Hmong girl walks past and Walt pats her on the
          head. Everyone in the room looks in horror at Walt.

          WALT
          What?! What the hell are all you
          fish heads looking at?!
          Sue looks around and then pulls Walt out of the room.

          SUE
          Maybe we should go in the other
          room.

          SUE
          A lot of the people in this house
          are very traditional. Number one,
          never touch a Hmong person on the
          head, not even a child. Hmong
          people believe that the soul
          resides in the head, so don't do
          that.

          WALT
          That's dumb, but fine.

          SUE
          Hmong people also consider looking
          someone in the eye to be rude.
          That's why everyone looks away
          when you look at them.

          WALT
          Swell. Anything else?

          SUE
          Yeah, some Hmong smile or grin
          when they're yelled at or get into
          a confrontation. It's a cultural
          thing. It expresses embarrassment
          or insecurity, not that they're
          laughing at you.

          Walt interrupts Sue.

          WALT
          Hey, Sue.

          SUE
          What?

          WALT
          You said you guys don't look you
          in the eye, but that guy keeps
          staring at me.
          Sue laughs and gestures to the Old Hmong Man. The Old
          Hmong Man steps over and nods to Walt.

          This is Kor Khue. He's the Lor

          Witch doctor?
          Sue smiles and nods.

          SUE
          Something like that. The Hmong
          hold their clan Shaman in very
          high regards.

          WALT
          Boo-ga, boo-ga.
          Kor Khue says something to Sue in Hmong. She turns and
          translates to Walt.

          SUE
          Kor Khue is interested in you, he
          heard what you did. He says he
          would like to read you.

          WALT
          Huh?

          SUE
          He wants to read you. Tell you
          your soul. It'd be rude not to
          allow him this, it's a great
          honor.

          WALT
          Tell Kor to be my guest, fire
          away.
          Sue speaks Hmong to the Shaman. The Shaman responds and
          sits down across from Walt. He looks at Walt for a long
          time.
          Walt stares straight back at him. The Shaman mumbles to
          himself.
          Finally the Shaman turns to Sue and speaks very rapidly.
          As Sue translates, the Shaman watches Walt's reaction.

          SUE
          Kor Khue says that you think
          you've been disrespected. You do
          not live your life. Your food has
          no flavor. You are scared of your
          past.

          Walt looks like he's been hit by a truck. The Shaman
          watches Walt closely, he knows he hit the nail on the
          head.
          Walt looks pale. He's been spooked good. He wipes sweat
          from his forehead.

          WALT
          Excuse me.
          Walt gets up and steps into the kitchen. He takes
          several deep breaths. He's pretty shook up.

          Walt looks around at all the Hmongs eating and carrying

          Walt sees a young man give up his seat to an Elder.
          Walt sees a young woman go to each of the older folks and
          offer tea and cookies from a tray.
          Walt sees a child help an old man out of the bathroom.
          Walt coughs hard. He wipes blood from his lips. Sue
          comes in and looks at Walt.

          Walt washes his face in the sink and dries his hands.
          He's still pale. He looks long and hard in the mirror.
          Walt is stunned, it all adds up. Walt hasn't really
          lived in 50 years, he hasn't relaxed or exhaled or let
          his guard down since he got back from Korea in 1953.

          Walt sits amongst several old Hmong Women, who take great
          delight in feeding him different Hmong dishes which he's
          obviously never tasted before.
          Walt reacts with great enthusiasm to the food,
          occasionally making jokes like he's choking, etc. This
          corny stuff goes over like gangbusters with the Hmong
          ladies.
          Sue comes in and rolls her eyes at Walt.

          Come on, you glutton, let's go

          To mingle.

          Walt and Sue descend the stairway. Walt is really out of
          his element down with all the Hmong teenagers.
          And the first person he sees across the room is Tao.

          WALT
          Oh great.

          SUE
          Well, look who's over there.

          WALT
          What's-his-name who tried to steal
          my Gran Torino.

          SUE
          My brother Tao.

          WALT
          Yeah, Toad.
          Tao is in the corner, he avoids Walt's gaze. Sue walks
          over to a group of boys, leaving Walt alone.
          Walt doesn't know what to do with himself. He leans
          against the DRYER. The DRYER wobbles.
          Walt gets on his hands and knees. He looks under the
          dryer. He adjusts the short leg to balance out the
          machine.
          He just can't help it.
          All the Hmong kids watch Walt, trying not to laugh at
          this strange white man on his hands and knees fixing a
          dryer during a party. Walt looks up -- deer in the
          headlights.

          WALT
          It was wobbly, but I fixed it.
          It's fine now, shouldn't wobble
          anymore.
          The Hmong kids look away, covering their mouths with
          their hands.
          Walt glares at Tao, who immediately wipes the smile from
          his face. Sue walks over and hands Walt a drink.

          Sue walks off. Walt sips his rice liquor and watches the
          interaction between the boys and girls.
          One particularly gorgeous young willow-wisp of a GIRL
          stares across the room at Tao. Tao looks back at her,
          but then looks away.
          The Girl keeps looking at Tao, smiling and twisting her
          hair.
          Tao doesn't approach her, but three other young men do.
          They do their best to charm her. She's polite, but not
          interested, she keeps looking at Tao.
          Walt laughs at Tao's ineptitude, shakes his head at this
          wasted opportunity. Suddenly the Girl steps over to
          Walt.
          She smiles --

          WA XAM (GIRL)
          My friends and I were just
          wondering what you're doing here?

          Walt pulls up in his pickup truck. Sue and Vu wait on
          Walt's porch. Tao stands out on the sidewalk.
          Walt gets out of his pickup.

          WALT
          What now? What?
          Vu rambles on in Hmong. Walt looks at his watch. He
          looks at Sue for the translation.

          SUE
          Tao is here to make amends, he's
          here to work for you.

          WALT
          No he's not.

          SUE
          Mother says that Tao dishonored
          the family and now he has to work
          off his debt. He'll start
          tomorrow morning.

          WALT
          No. The kid is useless, I don't
          even want him on my property. I
          thought we already went over that.

          SUE
          It's very important to my mother
          that you accept. It'd be an
          insult to refuse.

          WALT
          How is this all of a sudden turned
          around on me? The goddamned kid
          tries to steal my car and somehow
          I'm the bad guy if I don't accept?

          SUE
          My family is very traditional and
          it will very much upset them if
          you don't let Tao repay...
          Tao interrupts from the sidewalk...

          TAO
          Come on, Sue. If he doesn't want
          to, let's just go.
          Sue and Vu yell at Tao to shut up at the same time; Sue
          in English, Vu in Hmong.

          SUE/VU
          Shut up. Shut up! Shut up!!
          Tao looks at the ground.
          A PAUSE. Walt sees the earnest looks on the Hmong
          women's faces. Their expression begs Walt.
          Walt gazes back at Tao. Walt looks disgusted, he exhales
          loudly...

          WALT
          Fine. Great. Tomorrow.
          Walt walks past them and into his house.

          WALT
          Son of a bitch, I didn't think
          he'd show.
          Walt waves Tao over. Tao barely looks at Walt.

          Okay. What are you good at?

          WALT
          That's about what I expected.
          Okay, why don't you go over by the
          spruce tree and count how many
          birds feed at the bird feeder.

          TAO
          Count the birds?

          WALT
          Yeah, you can count? You slopes

          Tao stands in Walt's garden with his arms folded. Walt
          walks over to trim weeds around the garden fence.
          Walt doesn't even look at Tao. Finally...

          TAO
          You want me to do that?

          WALT
          No.

          TAO
          Why not?

          WALT
          I want it done right, that's why.

          TAO
          But you've got me just standing
          here. What am I supposed to be
          doing, anyway?

          Walt waters a flower bed. Tao comes over and stands
          there. Walt finishes watering before even looking at
          Tao.

          TAO
          What do you have for me today?
          You want me to watch paint dry or
          maybe count the clouds that pass

          have no balls.

          TAO
          Look, I'm stuck here. Why don't
          you give me something useful to
          do.

          WALT

          house.

          Tao is at the top of the LADDER. Walt and the Hmong
          neighbor grin at him from the bottom.

          When you're done caulking the
          siding, nail that gutter back up,
          I can see it right out my kitchen
          window, it's been bugging me for

          shaping up.
          Walt sips his coffee with a slight grin. He is really,

          STAFF is African or from India.
          As Walt waits, names are called out such as Alvarez,
          Ngaima, Yang and Abdalla.
          Finally when the name Kowalski is called, the Muslim
          woman can't pronounce it correctly. Walt winces.

          Tao stands, tiptoed on the top of a six-foot ladder,
          trying to cut a high branch with a pole saw.
          Walt shakes his head and walks over to Tao.

          WALT
          Hey, moron.
          Tao is startled and almost falls off the ladder.

          TAO
          What?

          WALT
          I appreciate you're doing
          something on your own, but you're
          the only person I know dumb enough
          to get himself killed trimming
          tree branches.

          TAO
          What now?

          WALT
          You don't stand on the top step of
          a ladder and if you cut through
          that branch you're hacking away
          at, you'll end up kaput.
          Tao looks and sure enough -- a thick, black POWER LINE is
          five feet below the branch he's almost severed.

          WALT
          Go grab the extension ladder from
          my garage and I'll show you how to

          Walt walks back over to his porch, grabs a Pabst from the
          cooler and watches Tao rake.
          A white Honda turns the corner and drives slowly past

          stands there, sipping his beer.

          Walt.
          The REAR WINDOW of the Honda opens.
          Walt holds out his RIGHT HAND like a GUN. He closes one
          eye to better aim his imaginary gun and moves his thumb
          several times as if firing. Bang -- bang -- bang.
          The Honda takes off. Walt watches it drive off and

          his pockets. He's a bit apprehensive.

          TAO
          What do you know about faucets?
          Walt stares at him for a second and then laughs.

          Tao looks on as Walt turns the faucet on and off, it
          drips water at its base. Walt looks under the sink.

          WALT
          For the love of Pete.

          TAO
          What?

          WALT
          It must be a hundred degrees in
          here, turn on the fan.
          Tao flips the switch on the CEILING FAN, the fan wobbles
          and shakes, it looks like it's about to fly off.
          Walt stares up at the fan and shakes his head.

          The CEILING FAN and FAUCET are taken apart on the
          workbench. Walt reinstalls the diverter valve. Tao
          looks at all of Walt's tools.

          TAO
          Man, where did you get all this
          stuff?

          WALT
          What are you talking about?

          TAO
          All the tools and stuff.

          WALT
          Where the hell do you think I got
          them, Toad? This may come as a
          shock to a thief, but I actually
          bought the things I have with
          money I earned.

          TAO
          Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's not what
          I meant. There's just so much
          shit packed in here.

          WALT
          You need the right tool for the
          right job. Every single thing
          here has a purpose.

          Tao points to a tool.

          WALT
          Post hole digger.
          Tao starts pointing at things on the workbench in quick
          succession, questioning Walt with his expression.

          WALT
          Hand spade. Tin snips. Nail
          punch. Tack hammer. Putty knife.
          Wire stripper. Drywall saw. Tile
          spacers.
          Silence. Walt can see something is bothering Tao, but
          he's too uncomfortable to speak up --

          WALT
          What?

          TAO
          I can't afford to buy all this
          stuff.

          WALT
          I didn't buy all this stuff at
          once, blockhead. I've lived here
          for fifty years. A man stays in
          one place long enough he tends to
          attract a decent set of tools.

          TAO
          Yeah, but...

          WALT
          Look, kid, I think I know where
          you're going with this. You don't
          need everything to maintain a
          house. I'm going to let you in on
          a little secret.
          Walt rattles around his tool bench and slaps down THREE
          items in quick succession.

          WALT
          This is for you. Roll of duct
          tape, can of WD-40 and a pair of
          vise-grips. Any man who's worth a
          shit can do half his household
          jobs with these three things. In
          the odd chance that doesn't work
          out, you can borrow something.

          Okay. Cool.
          Walt coughs and covers his mouth. Both Tao and Walt see
          the spot of BLOOD in his hand.

          TAO
          What's with that?

          WALT
          What's with what?

          TAO
          The blood you just coughed up.
          That's not good, you should see a
          doctor.
          Walt quickly changes the subject -- while tightening the
          screws that hold the fan blade to the motor hub.

          WALT
          So... what exactly was the deal
          with those guys out on my lawn
          that night? Who are they?

          TAO
          A gang. Hmong gangbangers.

          WALT
          I gathered that. What did they
          want with you?

          TAO
          They wanted to take me away
          because I blew my first
          initiation.

          WALT
          You joined up with those pukes?
          Damn, you are a pussy. Why in the
          hell did you do that?

          TAO
          I don't know. They were
          persuasive. My cousin's in the
          gang. They just talked me into it
          I guess.

          WALT
          Well, at least you're honest about
          it.
          A LONG SILENCE. Walt finishes fixing the ceiling fan.

          Walt straps an old WESTINGHOUSE FREEZER onto a two-
          wheeled DOLLY. Walt attempts to pull the freezer
          upstairs.
          Walt strains with the heavy appliance. It's too much
          weight for Walt, but this doesn't stop him from heaving
          and pulling.
          Walt could have done this by himself when he was younger.

          WALT
          I just need a little push. All
          the weight is up top, so you stay
          down and give me a little shove at
          each step.

          TAO
          Let me take the top.

          WALT
          Naw, I got it.

          TAO
          No really, I'll take the top. It
          looks pretty heavy.

          WALT
          I'm not crippled. I got it.

          TAO
          If you don't let me take the top,
          I ain't helping. I'll go home.

          WALT
          Listen, zipper head, now's not the
          time to go and...

          car he tried to steal from you.

          WALT
          It seems like justice to me. And
          if he misses a spot, he's doing it
          all over.

          SUE
          It's nice of you to kind of look
          after him like this. He doesn't
          have any real role models in his

          but are able to keep a foot on
          each side of the fence. The boys
          fall through the cracks.

          WALT
          Why?

          SUE
          It's tough. The boys float
          around. The fathers belong in a
          totally different world and the
          boys have no one to turn to. Does
          that make sense?

          Is that why I see you out in your

          want to do with your life?

          WALT
          You've never thought about it?

          TAO
          Of course I have.

          Well, while you're thinking about
          it, try not to stomp all over my
          chives, you dipshit.
          Tao looks down; sure enough, he's standing on Walt's
          chives.

          Put some mulch around the

          save instead of spreading mulch in
          my garden.

          Walt, you cheap asshole, I should
          have known you'd come in, I was
          having such a pleasant day.

          WALT

          out of a few bucks, give him the
          wrong change?
          Walt and the Barber shake hands warmly. Tao is wide-

          Who's the Nip?

          This is Tao. He's a pussy kid who

          Do it.
          Tao shrugs, goes outside, lets the door shut then comes

          Get outta my shop before I blow
          your head off, you long-haired
          faggy little gook!

          Kid, you shoulda just started with
          Hi' or Hello.'

          WALT

          and they SHAKE HANDS.
          It's really quite a moment for both of them.

          82
          Tao gets off the bus, his tool belt over his shoulder.
          Tao looks tired after working, but content. He walks
          past an abandoned lot.
          The tricked-out Honda pulls up and stops. Smokie, Spider
          and company get out. Tao looks nervous, but remains
          calm.

          TAO
          What now?

          SPIDER
          Just seeing what you're up to,
          cuz.

          TAO
          I'm getting home from work, not
          that you guys would know much
          about that.

          SPIDER
          So it's true? You got a job.

          TAO
          Come on, what do you guys want
          with me?

          SMOKIE
          Jesus Christ, Tao. What do you
          think? I've been sooooo easy on
          you, but I can't just go on like
          nothing happened.

          TAO
          You can't just leave me alone?

          SMOKIE
          Afraid not.
          The gangbangers grab Tao. Tao kicks and struggles as
          they yank away his tool belt.

          TAO
          Keep your hands off my stuff.

          SMOKIE
          Your stuff? You and everything
          you have is mine. I own you.
          Smokie pulls the tape measure off the belt and smashes it
          against the pavement. Whatever tools Smokie can't
          destroy, he tosses onto the roof of the closest building.

          SMOKIE
          You can't just walk away from us,
          Tao. It looks bad. It makes me
          look bad.
          Smokie lights a CIGARETTE and exhales...

          SMOKIE
          What's the phrase I'm looking for?
          Oh yeah, I need to save face.'
          Smokie grabs Tao by the neck and presses the lit
          CIGARETTE into Tao's cheek.
          Tao screams as his flesh burns.

          WALT
          Hey there.
          Tao looks to the ground and heads in the other direction.

          TAO
          Hey, I gotta run.

          WALT
          Wait a minute. Where have you
          been, I haven't seen you in days?

          TAO
          Busy.
          Walt squints at Tao. He steps closer. Tao looks away.
          Walt tilts Tao's head up, he sees the burn.

          WALT
          What in the hell happened to you?

          TAO
          Don't worry about it.

          WALT
          Don't worry about it? Look at
          your goddamned face!

          TAO
          I said don't worry about it. It's
          not your problem.
          Walt looks at the ground and spits.

          WALT
          When?

          TAO
          Couple days ago. Grabbed me after
          I got off the bus coming home from
          work.

          Cowards.

          TAO
          I did everything I could possibly
          do. They broke some of your

          No, Walt, I can manage. I don't
          want you doing anything.
          Walt is angry, but eventually nods at Tao.

          WALT
          Alright. You need any other tools
          for work?

          TAO
          I could use a roofing hammer.

          WALT
          Go in the garage and get whatever
          you need.

          Tao leans over his desk with a black Sharpie marker. He
          carefully writes Tao Vang Lor in black ink on the face
          of his smashed-up tape measure. He puts it back into the
          tool belt and grabs another tool to label.

          Walt sits in the dark, the only light is from the radio
          tuned to baseball. Daisy lies in the front seat. Next
          to Daisy is the M1 RIFLE.
          Walt watches as Spider and another Hmong gangbanger step
          out of the rundown duplex, get in their Honda and drive
          off.

          WALT
          That's the last of them.
          Walt pulls out his Colt .45 automatic and chambers a
          round.

          Walt drags the 105 pound Smokie out of his house and
          tosses him off the front porch onto the front sidewalk.
          Smokie is stunned. Walt kicks him hard in the ribs.

          SMOKIE
          How the fuck did you get here?!

          WALT
          You aren't that hard to track
          down.
          Walt boots him again. Smokie curls up in the fetal
          position.

          SMOKIE
          What do you want?
          Walt kicks him a second time.

          WALT
          I came to give you a chance.
          SOMETHING comes out of the shadows under the porch.
          Walt swings the barrel of the big Colt .45 at the
          movement.
          It's a cat. Walt puts his pistol away. Smokie exhales.

          WALT
          It's just you and me. Nobody
          knows or has to know I was here.
          You lay off Tao. Tell your guys
          he ain't worth it or whatever the
          hell you want. You don't talk to
          him, you don't go near him. This
          is your one chance. You lay off
          and no one will ever be the wiser.
          Smokie says nothing.

          WALT
          I'll take that as a yes. I don't
          want to come back here. But if I
          do, believe me, it'll be goddamned
          ugly.
          Walt kicks Smokie again and stalks off into the dark.

          Walt pulls up his driveway and parks. Daisy jumps out
          and Walt carries his rifle into the house. Walt walks
          stiffly.
          Walt gets to the door and drops his keys. When he bends
          down to pick them up, you can really tell he's sore and
          hurting.
          Walt groans as he goes inside. He's feeling his age.

          Vu, Sue, Tao and Wa Xam all sit in lawn chairs, talking

          Weber.

          WALT
          How do you want your dog... I mean
          steaks cooked? Medium, medium
          well?

          TAO
          Funny.
          Walt pops open a beer and grabs an appetizer that Vu
          made.

          WALT
          Is this Hmoog or Laab?

          SUE
          Laab.

          time. You're sure pleased with
          yourself today.

          Aw, go on.

          No, admit it. You are. You're

          Well, who wouldn't? I'm
          surrounded by beautiful women,
          it's a beautiful day. Great food,
          good friends. Hell, even Toad
          isn't driving me nuts for once.

          It never ends.

          WALT
          I'm just kidding. Let me tell you
          something, Yum-Yum. If Tao
          doesn't ask you out soon, I will.

          SUE
          Don't listen to him, Wa Xam. He's
          a white devil.

          WA XAM

          I'd love to, Walt, but he beat you

          TAO'S HOUSE is raked with GUNFIRE coming from a VAN!

          It's a miracle no one was killed.

          WALT
          They aimed high.
          Sure enough -- most of the bullet holes are above head
          level on the walls.

          Tao scrambles for the phone and dials.
          Tao speaks Hmong to whomever answered. Tao starts to
          speak faster. He looks at Walt and shakes his head no.

          wails, crying for Tao, Sue, his wife, kids and himself.

          What would you do?
          Father Janovich shakes his head.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          I know what I'd do if I was you,
          or at least what you think you
          should do. If I was Tao I guess
          I'd want vengeance. I'd want to
          stand shoulder to shoulder with
          you and kill those guys.

          WALT
          And you?

          FATHER JANOVICH
          What would I do? I'd come over
          here and talk to you I guess. I
          know you're close with these
          people, but this pisses me off
          too, Mr. Kowalski.
          Walt nods.

          WALT
          Wanna beer?

          FATHER JANOVICH
          I'd love one.

          WALT
          They're in the cooler, grab me one
          too.

          He opens a Pabst and takes a big swig.

          Nothing's fair, Father.

          Kowalski?

          Alright, what are you going to do,
          Walt?

          WALT
          I'm thinking.

          away from what's happened, Tao.

          TAO
          No. Don't let me down, Walt. Not
          you. This is going to end, today.
          Walt stands up and pulls out a chair for Tao to sit in.

          Sit down.

          I know what needs to be done. I
          need to prepare, this needs to be
          carefully planned. You know I'm

          down for a little while and meet
          me back here at 4 P.M. I promise
          you, what needs to be done, will
          be done.

          your cousin and those other Zips.
          Mr. Tough-Guy-All-Of-A-Sudden is

          never ordered a straight shave,
          ever.

          WALT
          That's right. I always wondered

          I made nine hundred dollars profit
          selling a boat and motor and never

          for you.

          TAO
          What?

          WALT
          In Korea, October, 1952. We were
          sent up to sweep a Chink machine
          gun nest that had carved us up
          pretty bad. I was the only one
          who came back... I received the
          Silver Star. I want you to have
          it.

          TAO
          Why?

          WALT
          When we went up that hill, we knew
          it was ten to one against us, but
          we went anyway. This trouble now,
          it's similar. We're walking right
          into it. We might not be coming
          home tonight.

          TAO
          The hell we won't. We're going to
          roll in there and tear ass.

          WALT
          Don't be a fool, these guys are
          waiting for that exact reaction.

          him. Walt slides the BOLT LOCK into place with a loud

          CLICK.

          and authority which startles Tao.

          scared kid when he tries to give
          up. A dumb, scared, little gook,

          bottles sits a bottle of Johnnie Walker Blue.

          WALT
          Think I'll try that Johnnie Walker
          Blue Label.

          Whatta ya win the lottery, Wally?

          WALT
          Naw, just having something
          special.
          Walt sips his Scotch and nods. It's good.

          WALT
          Why don't you get all the guys the
          same.

          BARTENDER
          You sure?

          WALT
          I'm sure. This is too good not to
          be shared.
          Walt finishes his Scotch and points for one more.
          Several regulars hold up their drinks towards Walt.

          Sue weakly answers the phone next to her bed.

          SUE
          Hello?

          WALT (V.O.)
          It's Walt. The key to my front
          door is under the ceramic turtle.
          Open the door and go let your
          brother out of the cellar. I have
          to go.
          The line goes dead as Walt hangs up. Sue jumps up out of
          bed, pulls on some clothes and runs downstairs.
          Phong blocks her path. Phong grabs Sue by the arms.

          Sue squirms away from Phong and runs outside. On her way
          over to Walt's house, she sees Daisy leashed to Phong's
          chair. It scares Sue even more.

          106
          Father Janovich paces back and forth. The SQUAD CAR
          pulls up to him, which is exactly what he's been afraid
          of all day.

          OFFICER
          Sorry, Father, we have to go.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          I'm telling you. If we're not
          here, there will be bloodshed.

          OFFICER
          We've been here for hours. We
          can't afford to anchor a unit to
          one location.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          I'm begging you to stay.

          OFFICER
          I just got word from my Sergeant,
          we're pulling the plug.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          I'm staying.

          OFFICER
          No you aren't. My orders are
          specific. You came with us,
          you're leaving with us.
          Father Janovich looks hard at the duplex before getting
          into the SQUAD CAR. The SQUAD CAR drives off.
          Walt pulls up in front, gets out of his pickup and slams
          the door. He looks at the duplex. It's a total eyesore.

          WALT

          (MUTTERS)
          What a goddamned mess. You slopes
          should be ashamed of yourselves.

          Walt walks up the sidewalk and stops twenty feet from the
          duplex.
          Six very scared, very jittery Hmong gangbangers look out
          at Walt from various doorways and windows.

          WALT
          Is that all you swamp rats or is
          there more vermin scurrying in the
          shadows?
          Smokie and Spider step out and stand on the porch.
          Smokie smiles at Walt. Walt spits on the ground.

          SMOKIE
          I wasn't sure that you'd...

          WALT
          Shut up, gook. I'm not here to
          listen to one goddamned syllable
          of what a shrimp-dicked little
          baby midget like you has to say.
          Spider pulls his PISTOL.

          WALT
          That's right, boy. Defend your
          boyfriend after he or you or
          whoever rapes a member of your
          family. Your own blood, for
          Christ's sake. Go ahead, pull
          your pistols, just like a bunch of
          ridiculous miniature toy cowboys.
          Smokie and several other Hmong gangbangers pull their
          guns.

          WALT
          You have no honor. You're the
          scum of the earth and when you're
          gone, do you think anyone will
          care? No one will mourn. You
          won't be missed.
          All the Hmong are spooked at Walt's absolute lack of
          fear.

          SMOKIE
          Where's Tao, old man? He too
          scared to come and stick up for
          himself?

          No. Tao is too good for this.
          You pukes aren't worth one second
          of his time.
          Walt slowly puts a CIGARETTE in his mouth. Even this
          slight movement has the gangbangers waving their PISTOLS
          around.
          Walt laughs.

          WALT
          You boys are a little bit jumpy.

          SPIDER
          You watch it, old man.

          WALT
          No, I think you'd better watch it.
          Walt looks around. Other than the gangbangers, a small
          group of people have gathered to watch this showdown.

          pounds down the stairs.

          Tao? Tao, are you alright?

          TAO (O.S.)

          I'M DOWN HERE! LET ME OUT!!
          She unlocks the CELLAR DOOR. Tao comes out in a rage.

          SUE
          What's going on?

          from them, Tao! I don't want

          NO, TAO. NO!
          They struggle at the top of the stairs and spill into the
          kitchen floor. Tao runs for the door when something
          catches his eye...
          The kitchen table.
          The RIFLE and PISTOL are still there.
          Walt purposely left the guns at home.

          WALT
          Hail Mary, full of grace.
          Walt reaches into his coat pocket. Six Hmong gangbangers
          simultaneously level their PISTOLS and FIRE.
          BULLETS FLY. Walt is struck down. People scream.
          Walt falls dead. A ZIPPO lighter clutched in his hand.

          Tao and Sue arrive just as Smokie, Spider and company are
          being driven away in Police cars.
          Tao looks at Smokie in the squad car. Smokie no longer
          looks tough or hard, he just looks scared.
          On the street, Walt is being bagged by the ambulance
          crew. Father Janovich prays over him.
          Tao steps up to a POLICE OFFICER.

          TAO
          What happened?

          POLICE OFFICER
          You have to step back.

          TAO
          He was a friend of mine.

          POLICE OFFICER
          I said step back.
          Tao turns to the HMONG POLICE OFFICER.

          TAO
          What happened, man?
          The Hmong Police Officer looks at the WHITE POLICE
          OFFICER and then to Tao.

          HMONG POLICE OFFICER
          You heard him, step back.
          Tao speaks to the HMONG OFFICER in their native language.

          TAO

          Officer Chang, get those people
          back.

          HMONG POLICE OFFICER
          Yes, sir. You have to step back
          now.
          Tao hugs his sister. Sue openly weeps. Tao holds it in.
          He looks at his friend Walt as the bag is zipped over

          in.
          Sitting on the porch is Phong who rocks back and forth in
          her rocking chair. Phong holds Daisy in her arms, gently

          Along with the crowd you'd expect, Tao and Sue are seated
          near the front.
          Walt's sons and family are there. Mitch gives Tao a
          dirty look. Tao looks back at him, his gaze bores right
          through Mitch. Mitch looks away.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          Walt Kowalski once said to me I
          didn't know anything about life or
          death because I was an
          overeducated, 27-year-old virgin
          who held the hands of
          superstitious old women and
          promised them eternity.' Walt
          definitely had no problem calling
          it like he saw it.' But Walt was
          right. I knew really nothing
          about life or death until I got to
          know Walt. And boy, did I learn.

          Which brings us to our last item.
          And again, please forgive the
          language used in Mr. Kowalski's
          will. I'm simply reading it as it
          was written.
          The LAWYER takes a sip of water before reading...

          LAWYER
          And to my friend, Tao Vang Lor, I
          leave my 1972 Gran Torino on the
          condition that you don't choptop
          the roof like a damned spick,
          don't paint any idiotic flames on

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	FADE IN:
	
	EXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
	
	AN ANGLE establishing the race track, Ruidoso Downs
	(pronounced Ree-oh-do-so), set among the beautiful mountains
	of New Mexico's Lincoln National Forest, as a white Chrysler
	turns in with a stream of cars moving toward the parking
	area.
	
	AN ANGLE through the open driver-side window of the Chrysler
	at LILLY DILLON, 39 but looking younger, beautiful but cold
	and watchful.
	
	WIDE SHOT, track in b.g. as Lilly parks the Chrysler, gets
	out, locks the car. As she walks toward the track, WIPE
	RIGHT, as SCENE TWO WIPES IN from the left. SCENE ONE CAMERA
	FOLLOWS Lilly as she walks across the large parking area.
	SPLIT SCREEN.
	
	SCENE TWO:
	
	EXT. SIDE STREET - DAY
	
	Downtown Los Angeles, near the courts and the business
	section. ROY DILLON, 25, handsome and charming but self
	indulgent, parks his orange Honda convertible, gets out,
	picks up a large ledger book from the back seat, goes around
	to open the trunk.
	
	AN ANGLE on the trunk, establishing the tools of the
	salesman's trade: catalogs, samples, ledgers full of manuals
	and product sheets. Roy adds the ledger from the back seat,
	shuts the trunk, walks away.
	
	EXT. 6TH STREET - DAY
	
	Roy walks around the corner near a bar/restaurant. As he
	approaches it, WIPE LEFT, the two half-width scenes
	contracting to one-third each as SCENE THREE WIPES IN from
	the right.
	
	SCENE ONE: Lilly approaches the track's entrance doors.
	
	SCENE TWO: Roy approaches the bar.
	
	SCENE THREE:
	
	EXT. SANTA MONICA BOULEVARD - DAY
	
	A baby blue Cadillac parks in front of a jeweler.
	
	AN ANGLE on the driver's door as MYRA LANGTRY, 36, beautiful
	in an impersonal calculating way, gets out, carrying a small
	jewelry care, and locks the car. At first glance, Myra looks
	rather like Lilly. (Myra always wears large dangly earrings,
	and usually wears big-lensed dark sunglasses.)
	
	SIMULTANEOUSLY:
	
	SCENE ONE: Lilly enters the track.
	
	SCENE TWO: Roy enters the bar.
	
	SCENE THREE: Myra enters the jeweler's.
	
	WIPE RIGHT AND LEFT, as SCENE TWO takes FULL SCREEN.
	
	INT. BAR - DAY
	
	AN ANGLE on a hurried bartender in a full bar, crowded with a
	NOISY lunchtime crowd. In b.g., Roy slithers his way to the
	bar, waving a bill in the air to attract the bartender's
	attention.
	
	AN ANGLE on Roy as the bartender comes to him. Roy puts the
	bill on the bar, holding it down with one finger, as he
	SHOUTS his order. The bartender looks down.
	
	BARTENDER'S POV: Roy's finger holds down a twenty dollar
	bill.
	
	AN ANGLE steep over Roy's shoulder, the twenty visible, as
	the bartender hurries away to get the drink. Roy's hand makes
	a fist, swallowing the twenty, opens, pushing a ten out onto
	the bar, holding it there with one finger.
	
	AN ANGLE on the bartender returning with a draft beer,
	nodding to other ORDERS shouted to him along the way, putting
	the beer down, grabbing the bill without looking at it,
	hurrying away.
	
	AN ANGLE on Roy, content, smiling, sipping his beer.
	
	AN ANGLE on the bartender, hurrying by, slapping Roy's change
	down, moving on, Roy nodding acknowledgement, reaching out.
	
	CU, the change, a ten dollar bill on top. Roy's hand closes
	over it.
	
	EXT. TOTE BOARD - DAY
	
	WIDE SHOT, the tote board at the track, showing the shifting
	odds on the horses for the next race, the amounts bet.
	
	CLOSE SHOT, number 3. Not much bet, odds 70-1.
	
	EXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
	
	AN ANGLE on Lilly, frowning at the tote board. She carries a
	large heavy shoulder-bag, which she opens, looking in it as
	though it were a file drawer.
	
	AN ANGLE on Lilly studying the contents of her bag, the track
	beyond her, the mountains visible out beyond the track wall.
	Lilly moves.
	
	AN ANGLE on a high-dollar betting window, as Lilly
	approaches, taking bank-banded wads of bills from her bag.
	
	EXT. TOTE BOARD - DAY
	
	A change of numbers sweeps across the board.
	
	EXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
	
	Lilly moves away from the betting window, tucking betting
	tickets into her bag.
	
	ECU, Lilly's bag, compartmented, with stacks of money, small
	envelopes and notes on notepaper in each compartment. Lilly
	carefully files the betting slips.
	
	AN ANGLE on Lilly looking out at the tote board.
	
	EXT. TOTE BOARD - DAY
	
	CU, number 3. Odds 32-1.
	
	EXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
	
	AN ANGLE on Lilly, not satisfied. She turns and goes back.
	
	AN ANGLE at the betting window as Lilly arrives and makes
	more bets.
	
	EXT. TOTE BOARD - DAY
	
	CU, number 3. Odds 32-1. CROWD NOISE INCREASES. The numbers
	shift: odds 26-1.
	
	                    CALLER (O.S.)
	          And they're off!
	
	INT. JEWELER'S OFFICE - DAY
	
	Very quiet, stately; abrupt contrast with the track. A slow
	ticking clock.
	Myra sits in the client's chair, while at the desk sits the
	JEWELER, a pleasant but overweight man of 40, who studies a
	jeweled bracelet through a loupe. He sighs, drops the loupe,
	shakes his head regretfully.
	
	                    JEWELER
	          Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Why? What's wrong?
	
	                    JEWELER
	              (personal emotion mixed
	               in)
	          You are a valued customer, as you
	          know.
	
	                    MYRA
	          But what's wrong?
	
	                    JEWELER
	          I can't understand a thing like
	          this. It's something you almost
	          never see.
	
	                    MYRA
	          What is?
	
	                    JEWELER
	              (holding up bracelet)
	          This is some of the finest
	          filigreed platinum I've ever seen.
	          But the stones, no. They're not
	          diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.
	
	                    MYRA
	          But they must be! They cut glass!
	
	                    JEWELER
	              (wry)
	          Glass will cut glass, Mrs. Langtry.
	          Do you know where it was purchased?
	
	INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
	
	An expensive hotel room, with a sunstruck day beyond the
	windows. Myra, naked, a few years younger, sits cross-legged
	on the bed and laughs at COLE "FARMER" LANGLEY, 55, stringy
	bodied, who stands naked, his back to us, hands on hips,
	presenting himself to Myra. She reaches forward, hand hidden
	by his body as she lifts something that was hanging on
	something at the front of him. She brings back the bracelet,
	looks at it, is delighted, puts it on, and then leans forward
	again toward the unmoving Cole, her head hidden by his body.
	
	INT. JEWELER'S OFFICE - DAY
	
	                    MYRA
	          It was a gift. It isn't worth
	          anything at all?
	
	                    JEWELER
	              (warm, encouraging)
	          Why, of course it is. I can offer
	          you -- well, five hundred dollars.
	
	Myra expected -- and needed -- a lot more. She's worried,
	tense, but stuck. She nods.
	
	                    MYRA
	          All right.
	
	                    JEWELER
	              (rising)
	          I'll get you a check.
	
	He leaves the room. Myra grimaces, in almost physical pain.
	
	INT. SECOND BAR - DAY
	
	Another crowded lunchtime bar. A big beefy BARTENDER moves
	quickly, carrying a draft beer.
	
	AN ANGLE on Roy, in position, finger holding bill down, as
	the bartender arrives, puts down the beer, reaches for the
	bill, stops, stares at the bill.
	
	TWO SHOT, the bartender and Roy, as the bartender gives Roy a
	very cold look. He knows, and Roy knows he knows. Roy tries
	an innocent smile, which doesn't work. Roy moves.
	
	CU, the ten dollar bill, as Roy grabs it, but the bartender
	simultaneously grabs Roy's wrist.
	
	AN ANGLE on Roy and the bartender as Roy tries to pull away
	and the bartender holds him with his left hand while reaching
	under the bar with his right. He comes up with a sawed-off
	baseball bat. Roy, seeing it, throws his free arm up to
	protect his head, but the bartender pushes the blunt end of
	the bat straight across the bar at a downward angle and hard
	into Roy's solar plexus, driving the air out of him and
	propelling him back away from the bar, leaving the ten. The
	nearest CUSTOMERS on both sides become aware that something
	happened, but nothing follows and they're already involved in
	conversations. The bartender scoops up the ten as he puts the
	bat away under the bar.
	
	AN ANGLE on Roy, arms folded across his torso, staring in
	shock toward the bar, where the space he filled has already
	been closed in by other bodies. Nearly retching, he stumbles
	toward the door.
	
	EXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
	
	AN ANGLE on four PEOPLE at a table, CHEERING a race,
	switching to disgust and despair when they lose, moving away
	from the table, leaving their betting tickets behind. Lilly
	passes by, smoothly and casually scoops up the tickets, moves
	on along a row of tables, and there finding more tickets.
	
	INT. JEWELER'S OFFICE - DAY
	
	Myra sits as before. The jeweler enters with a check, which
	he hands her. She looks up at him, making no move to leave.
	
	                    JEWELER
	          I hope you're not too badly
	          disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.
	
	                    MYRA
	          It's not your fault.
	
	                    JEWELER
	          You'll give us an opportunity to
	          serve you again, I hope. If there's
	          anything you think we might be
	          interested in...
	
	                    MYRA
	          I have only one thing now. Are you
	          interested?
	
	                    JEWELER
	          Well, I'd have to see it, of
	          course.
	
	                    MYRA
	          You are seeing it. You're looking
	          right at it.
	
	The jeweler is puzzled, then startled.
	
	                    JEWELER
	          I see.
	
	He turns away, goes behind his desk, sits down, looks at
	Myra.
	
	                    JEWELER
	          You know something, Mrs. Langtry? A
	          bracelet like that very rarely
	          happens. A fine setting and
	          workmanship usually mean precious
	          stones. It always hurts me when I
	          find they're not. I always hope -- 
	              (faint sad friendly smile)
	          -- I'm mistaken.
	
	Myra likes him better now, even though he hasn't solved her
	problem. She rises.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Thank you. For everything you felt
	          you could do.
	
	EXT. STREET - DAY
	
	Roy has been throwing up but is finished now. He's sprawled
	like a shot deer across the hood of his Honda, still
	clutching his stomach. A police car stops, the passenger COP
	gets out. He's suspicious at first.
	
	                    COP
	          Sir? Everything all right?
	
	The sight of the uniform forces Roy into gear. He
	straightens, smiling through his pain.
	
	                    ROY
	          Getting better. A bad shrimp, I
	          think.
	
	The con's suspicion changes to concern.
	
	                    COP
	          Want us to take you to a doctor?
	
	                    ROY
	          No no, I'm fine now, thanks,
	          anyway. Still got a lot of clients
	          to see.
	
	                    COP
	          Take it easy, now.
	
	                    ROY
	          Oh, I will.
	
	EXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
	
	Late afternoon. AN ANGLE on the parking area, where almost
	all the cars are gone and the few remaining are widely
	separated. The white Chrysler is one of these. Lilly walks to
	it from the track entrance.
	
	AN ANGLE on the Chrysler as Lilly opens the trunk, puts her
	bag inside.
	
	CLOSE UP, Lilly and the trunk. She takes betting tickets from
	her bag, sorts them, files them in envelopes in different
	compartments, puts some to one side, then sorts through these
	separated tickets, throwing some away, keeping some. She
	takes money from the bag, puts tickets in, closes the bag
	with the money on the trunk floor. Reaching farther in, she
	lifts the pad deep inside the trunk, lifts the metal floor
	panel, and reveals a cache mostly filled with money. She adds
	today's skim, puts everything away, puts the bag back on her
	shoulder, closes the trunk.
	
	EXT. MADERO APARTMENTS - DAY
	
	A shabby apartment hotel on Wilshire. An exterior hall
	balcony on each floor has the entrance doors to the front
	apartments. Roy's Honda makes the turn and enters the
	basement garage.
	
	INT. MADERO LOBBY - DAY
	
	Modest but clean. The owner, SIMMS, a sloppy garrulous old
	bore, talks with a potential RENTER.
	
	                    SIMMS
	          Put it this way, now. Say I rent to
	          a woman, well, she has to have a
	          room with a bath. I insist on it,
	          because otherwise she's got the
	          hall bath tied up all the time,
	          washing her goddamn hair and her
	          clothes and everything she can
	          think of.
	
	In b.g., Roy, still in pain, comes out of the elevator, waves
	to Simms, who waves back without pausing in his monologue,
	and crosses to the mailboxes.
	
	                    SIMMS
	          Now, your minimum for a room with
	          bath is three hundred a month, just
	          for a place to sleep and no cooking
	          allowed.
	          And just how many of these tootsies
	          make that kind of money and have to
	          eat in restaurants and buy clothes
	          and --
	
	Roy, carrying his junk mail and pretending not to be in pain,
	crosses to Simms.
	
	                    ROY
	          Mr. Simms.
	
	                    SIMMS
	              (fawning)
	          Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a
	          potential new neighbor, looking at--
	
	                    ROY
	              (uninterested)
	          Uh-huh. Mrs. Langtry may drop by.
	
	Simms doesn't like Mrs. Langtry, but can't say so.
	
	                    SIMMS
	          I'll send her right up.
	
	Roy goes back to the elevator. Simms continues his monologue.
	
	                    SIMMS
	          I had my first hotel thirty-seven
	          years ago in Wichita Falls, Texas,
	          and that's where I began to learn
	          about women. They just don't make
	          the money, you see, not regular
	          they don't, and there's only one
	          way they can get it.
	
	Roy enters the elevator.
	
	                    SIMMS
	          Now, that Mr. Dillon there, that's
	          the fine type of person I have in
	          mind for here. Like yourself, I
	          have no doubt. He's a salesman,
	          regular as clockwork, has a suite
	          here. Fine man. Now, about these
	          women. At first, you know, they
	          just go out and do it now and then,
	          just enough to make ends meet. But
	          pretty soon they got that bank open
	          twenty-four hours a day, and then
	          you've got trouble. Hookers and
	          hotellin' just don't mix.
	          You'd think the cops'd be too busy
	          catching real criminals, not
	          snooping around after working
	          girls, but that's the way the gravy
	          stains, as the saying is, and I
	          don't fight it. An ounce of
	          prevention is my motto.
	
	Myra enters from the front, looks across at Simms, points
	upward. Simms calls to her.
	
	                    SIMMS
	          Oh, yes, Mrs. Langtry, he's up
	          there, he's expecting you.
	
	Myra crosses to the elevator. Simms speaks more softly.
	
	                    SIMMS
	          If you keep out the women in the
	          first place, see, you keep out the
	          hookers, and then you keep out the
	          cops, and that's how you have a
	          clean place.
	
	EXT. ROY'S APARTMENT - DAY
	
	AN ANGLE along the balcony, with Roy's apartment door in f.g.
	and Los Angeles in b.g. Myra crosses to the door, opens it
	with her key, enters.
	
	INT. BATHROOM - DAY
	
	A small crowded old-fashioned bathroom. Roy, shirt open and
	trousers pushed down almost to his crotch, looks in the
	mirror at purplish greenish bruises on his stomach. He
	touches his stomach, winces.
	
	                    MYRA (O.S.)
	          Roy?
	
	He looks at the door, then grins at his reflection.
	
	                    ROY
	          Your medicine is here.
	
	He leaves the bathroom.
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
	
	Hotel furniture, shabby and anonymous. On the walls,
	contrasting with everything else, are two crying-clown
	pictures on black velvet, mounted in big boxy frames. Myra
	stands in the middle of the room, and Roy enters, shirt and
	trousers still disarranged.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (amused by clothing)
	          Well, well. In a real hurry, are
	          we?
	
	                    ROY
	          Always, for you, baby.
	
	He reaches for her, but she playfully holds him off.
	
	                    MYRA
	          You aren't taking me for granted,
	          are you?
	
	                    ROY
	          Taking you for granite?
	
	He grins, as his fingertip prods her breast.
	
	                    ROY
	          That isn't granite. If that fell on
	          me, it wouldn't hurt at all.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (playing along)
	          Are you sure?
	
	                    ROY
	              (pulling her close)
	          Let's find out.
	
	EXT. HIGHWAY PHONE BOOTH - DAY
	
	Lilly's white Chrysler is parked next to an open-air phone.
	Traffic whizzes by. Lilly talks on the phone, with pen and
	notebook at the ready. The racetrack is visible in the b.g.
	
	                    LILLY
	          I'm done here. Do I come back to
	          Baltimore?
	
	INT. OFFICE - DAY
	
	It could be an expensive, if gaudy, lawyer's office.
	Baltimore harbor is visible past the windows. IRV, the
	accountant, sits at a desk covered -- but neatly covered --
	with ledgers, computer printouts, etc. He speaks on the
	phone.
	
	                    IRV
	          Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.
	
	INTERCUT PHONE BOOTH AND OFFICE
	
	                    LILLY
	          Delmar? I never go out to
	          California. That's a thousand miles
	          from here.
	
	                    IRV
	          Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody
	          to handle playback this time. Come
	          on, Lilly, you don't argue with
	          Bobo.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (fatalistic)
	          I know.
	
	                    IRV
	          Take two, three days. Call when you
	          get there.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang
	          gleez on the way.
	
	This is Lilly making the best of the situation. She listens a
	bit more, GRUNTS a farewell, hangs up, moves to her car.
	
	INT. BEDROOM - DAY
	
	Again, anonymous hotel furniture. Roy and Myra naked in bed,
	he on his back, she straddling him, both moving gently. He's
	half feeling pleasure, half unconscious.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Roy?
	
	                    ROY
	          Mm?
	
	                    MYRA
	          Look at me.
	
	                    ROY
	          Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Roy? It this all we have?
	
	                    ROY
	          All? It ain't bad.
	
	                    MYRA
	          No more than this? 
	
	He tries to concentrate on her.
	
	                    ROY
	          What are you talking abut, Myra?
	          Marriage?
	
	                    MYRA
	          I didn't say that. You aren't
	          marriage material.
	
	He keeps watching her, ironic, hips moving. Looking for a
	distraction, she notices the bruise on his stomach.
	
	                    MYRA
	          What's that?
	
	She touches it; he flinches back, in real pain.
	
	                    ROY
	          Ow! Hey, what are you trying to do,
	          throw me off my game?
	
	                    MYRA
	              (laughing)
	          No, baby. Come to Mama.
	
	She folds forward onto him. He puts his arms around her. They
	rock together slowly.
	
	EXT. MOTEL - DAY
	
	The same mountains in b.g. as at the track. Lilly carries two
	small bags from her motel room, puts them on the back seat of
	the Cadillac, gets behind the wheel, drives away.
	
	INT. BATHROOM - DAY
	
	Myra, dressed, primps at the mirror, surveys herself
	critically, is reasonably satisfied, leaves.
	
	INT. BEDROOM - DAY
	
	Roy lies supine on the bed, semi-conscious, half-covered by a
	sheet. Myra, casual, not noticing his condition, leans her
	head in through the doorway.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Wore you out, did I? It's a good
	          woman you can't keep down, baby.
	
	He moves fitfully, CROAKS an attempt at speech.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Have a good sleep, baby. Call you
	          tomorrow. 
	
	He sits up, trying to grin and be easy.
	
	                    ROY
	          Wait'll next year.
	
	AN ANGLE across Roy's profile, with open bedroom door beyond
	him. Through it, the living room and outer door can be seen.
	Myra crosses the living room, opens the door. Bright sunlight
	pours in, emphasizing the sweat on his face. She closes the
	door, and he gives up trying to smile. Gingerly, he touches
	his bruised stomach, winces.
	
	                    ROY
	          Damn that guy.
	
	He's going to get out of bed, but movement creates pain. He
	sits back against the headboard, looks around, reaches
	painfully to the bedside table drawer, takes a quarter from
	it, studies the quarter, feels it with fingertips, places it
	on the back of his left hand, slowly moves the soft pads of
	his right palm over it, then turns the quarter over and
	repeats. Then he takes the quarter in his right hand, flips
	it, slaps it down onto the back of his left hand, SPEAKS
	simultaneously with the hands coming together.
	
	                    ROY
	          Smack.
	
	He looks away, right hand moving minimally on left hand.
	
	                    ROY
	          Heads.
	
	He lifts the right hand, nods, then flips the coin again,
	looks away, moves the right hand slightly.
	
	                    ROY
	          Heads.
	
	Again he's right. Again he repeats.
	
	                    ROY
	          Tails.
	
	He's about to repeat when a wave of weakness comes over him.
	He sits back, gasping, but won't acknowledge the problem.
	He forces himself to flip the coin, misses catching it, finds
	it on the blanket, flips it again, slaps it onto the back of
	the other hand, looks away.
	
	                    ROY
	          Tails.
	
	Right again. He prepares to flip the coin, but then his hand
	sags onto the covers, his chin drops, his eyes glaze.
	
	                    ROY
	              (whispered)
	          How much can I bet?
	
	INT. PASSENGER TRAIN - DAY
	
	The train runs through a forest, tree shadows making a light
	and-dark pattern. Roy, four or five years younger, sits with
	a three-core-monte gang, consisting of a DEALER, a spectacled
	SHILL beside him, Roy facing the dealer, a ROPER next to Roy.
	On a briefcase on the dealer's lap are three cards, face up:
	An ace and two deuces. Across the aisle, alone in the seats,
	sits MINTZ, a conman in his fifties, pretending not to watch,
	but watching with amusement.
	
	                    DEALER
	          That's between you two. I got
	          nothing at stake here, I'm just
	          dealing.
	
	                    SHILL
	          What if we both guess wrong? You
	          aren't gonna take...
	
	The dealer turns aside, allowing himself to be distracted. He
	and the shill ARGUE nonsensically. The roper nudges Roy, then
	reaches out and crimps the ace. Roy's doing a wide-eyed
	bumpkin kid; he stares at the roper in delight and amazement.
	
	AN ANGLE on the shill, arguing with the dealer but looking
	toward Roy and the roper, then increasing the force of his
	argument.
	
	AN ANGLE across the amused Mintz at the roper whispering to
	Roy.
	
	TWO SHOT, Roy and the roper.
	
	                    ROPER
	          We got him now! Put down that big
	          bill you got.
	
	                    ROY
	              (whispered)
	          The fifty or the hundred?
	
	                    ROPER
	          The hundred! Hurry!
	
	                    ROY
	              (doubtful)
	          The ace is what I want?
	
	The roper's having trouble keeping his patience.
	
	                    ROPER
	          Sure it is!
	
	TWO SHOT, the dealer and the shill, fake-squabbling, Roy and
	the roper seen in b.g. between their faces, Roy finally
	bringing out his wallet, withdrawing a bill. Relieved, the
	dealer and the shill cut the crap.
	
	AN ANGLE on the group as Roy puts his hundred dollar bill on
	the briefcase.
	
	                    ROY
	          Is that okay?
	
	The shill pulls a messy wad of bills from his inner pocket,
	uses most of it to cover the bet.
	
	                    SHILL
	          You're damn right that's okay.
	
	                    DEALER
	              (picks up the cards)
	          Whoever finds the ace, wins.
	
	ECU, the dealer's hands, shuffling the cards at lightning
	speed. He deals the cards out face down.
	
	INT. BEDROOM - DAY
	
	CU, Roy's sweat-covered face, eyelids fluttering.
	
	                    ROY
	              (whispered)
	          Dark in here.
	
	INT. PASSENGER TRAIN - DAY
	
	AN ANGLE on the group. Roy squints at the cards, light and
	dark playing on his face.
	
	                    ROY
	          Too dark. I just can't see.
	
	Casually, but too quickly to be stopped, he reaches across
	and plucks the shill's glasses off.
	
	                    ROY
	          Let me borrow these, will you?
	
	AN ANGLE across Mintz, surprised and amused, at the group in
	b.g., in consternation as Roy puts on the glasses and looks
	down at the cards.
	
	                    ROY
	          Now, that's better.
	
	ROY'S POV: The glasses are 'readers.' Through them, a large
	gray 'A' can be seen on the back of one of the non-crimped
	cards. Roy's hand reaches out and flips it over. It's the ace
	of spades.
	
	INT. BEDROOM - DAY
	
	AN ANGLE across Roy toward the doorway. Roy, eyes closed,
	smiles in triumph, then winces in pain. Mintz partially
	appears, hovering beside the bed, grinning at Roy.
	
	                    MINTZ
	          I didn't teach you that.
	
	                    ROY
	              (whispered)
	          You taught me a lot. Then I
	          invented.
	
	INT. AIRPORT DEPARTURE LOUNGE - DAY
	
	Weary bored people sit around waiting. Roy, 17, lugging a big
	suitcase, walks through, takes a seat near Mintz, who's doing
	card tricks for his own pleasure. Roy watches, then moves
	closer.
	
	                    ROY
	          Let me see how you did that one.
	
	                    MINTZ
	          Scram. Go home.
	
	                    ROY
	          I can't. I just left home.
	
	                    MINTZ
	          You're too young. You should be in
	          school.
	
	                    ROY
	          I am in school.
	
	Mintz peers at him, taking an interest. Then he holds up the
	five of spades, shows it to Roy, puts it back in the deck,
	shuffles, shows Roy the deck.
	
	                    MINTZ
	          Where's the five?
	
	                    ROY
	          In your other hand.
	
	Mintz grins slowly, turns his hand over with the palmed card
	showing.
	
	INT. BEDROOM NIGHT
	
	Roy slumps, eyes closed, half-smiling, with the fever Mintz
	hovering. Roy's smile fades, his fluttering eyelids grow
	still, his face slack. The fever Mintz fades and disappears.
	
	EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
	
	AN ANGLE on a large sign indicating "Los Angeles" straight
	ahead. CAMERA PANS DOWN and around 180 degrees to face the
	several lanes of heavy Los Angeles-bound traffic. LONG BEAT.
	Hundreds of cars rush by. CAMERA PANS with Lilly's white
	Chrysler as it comes along in the stream.
	
	AN ANGLE through the Chrysler's left side window at Lilly,
	driving, concentrating, biting her left thumbnail. She
	becomes aware that's what she's doing, shakes her head in
	irritation: She's trying to break herself of this habit.
	Ostentatiously she tucks the thumb into her fist, rests the
	fist on top of the steering wheel, where she can keep an eye
	on it.
	
	HIGH ANGLE on the westbound lanes. The Chrysler passes. Soon
	it's out of sight among all the other cars. LONG BEAT.
	
	INT. BEDROOM - DAY
	
	AN ANGLE across the unmoving unconscious Roy toward the
	doorway. The apartment door beyond the living room opens,
	throwing light on Roy, who doesn't react. Lilly enters, in
	silhouette, closes the door, crosses toward the bedroom.
	(Until she speaks, we can't be quite sure who this is. With
	the similarity between herself and Myra, this could be Myra.)
	
	                    LILLY
	              (hesitant)
	          Roy?
	
	No reaction. Lilly, getting worried, moves closer, through
	the bedroom doorway.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Roy? You asleep?
	
	His head moves slightly. He barely has strength to speak.
	
	                    ROY
	          Myra?
	
	She moves forward to the side of the bed, only her torso IN
	FRAME. She touches a hand to his forehead.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (startled)
	          My God!
	
	She turns, hurries back to the living room, looks around for
	the phone, crosses to it, dials, SPEAKS. Roy's eyes open, he
	frowns.
	
	                    ROY
	          Lilly?
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
	
	Lilly, hard and fast and urgent, on the phone.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Tell the doctor I work for Bobo
	          Justus, and this is an emergency.
	          Don't worry, he knows who Bobo is.
	
	INT. BEDROOM - DAY
	
	AN ANGLE down toward Roy, from above, he's weak but troubled.
	Eyes closed, frowning, whispering.
	
	                    ROY
	          Go away, Lilly. Go away.
	
	Roy's eyes close. He looks dead. SLOW FADE.
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
	
	The DOCTOR, a nervous heavyset man in his fifties, a drinker
	from the look of him, is on the phone in b.g., while Lilly
	prowls the room, looking at everything with distaste, then
	stopping to frown at the box-framed clown pictures. She
	doesn't get it. She touches one of the pictures, trying to
	understand. The doctor hangs up, turns to Lilly.
	
	                    DOCTOR
	              (lugubrious)
	          The ambulance is on the way, for
	          what good it will do.
	
	                    LILLY
	          What? He's going to be all right!
	
	                    DOCTOR
	          Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some
	          sort of accident. He's had an
	          internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding
	          to death inside.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Well, make it stop!
	
	                    DOCTOR
	          His blood pressure is under a
	          hundred. I don't think he'll live
	          to get to the hospital.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (icy, stern)
	          You know who I work for.
	
	He's uncomfortable, wants to dismiss that part of his life.
	
	                    DOCTOR
	          Yes, yes, but that's --
	
	                    LILLY
	          My son will be all right. If he
	          isn't, I'll have you killed.
	
	The doctor stares at her in astonishment, then in belief.
	SOUND of ambulance siren. To break the moment, he crosses to
	the door, opens it. Light bathes Lilly. The doctor steps back
	across the threshold, waiting for the ambulance. He looks
	back at Lilly, who stares at him.
	
	INT. AMBULANCE - DAY
	
	ECU, Roy, skin pallid, eyes closed and sunken, lips white.
	SOUND of siren LOUDER. SOUND SEGUES to CHILD CRYING. CRYING
	FADES.
	
	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
	
	A clumsy slum hotel fifteen years ago, with a tiny lobby, the
	DESK CLERK at a half-door in one wall. Lilly, at 24, enters
	from the street. This is a definite hooker, with bright
	maroon hair and a black-and-white miniskirt. She stops
	wordlessly at the desk for her key.
	
	                    CLERK
	              (handing key)
	          Your kid's in the back here. He's
	          crying.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Roy? He's always crying.
	
	                    CLERK
	              (sympathetic to Roy)
	          The kids beat him up, because his
	          home life is, uh, different.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (ironic)
	          I like you, too.
	
	The clerk shrugs. He doesn't like this tough broad. He turns
	and calls back into his office.
	
	                    CLERK
	          Roy, your mother's here.
	
	Roy, 10, comes reluctantly out to Lilly, sniffling and
	rubbing his arm.
	
	                    LILLY
	          So what's your story today?
	
	                    ROY
	          They twisted my arm.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (laughing lightly)
	          Only one arm?
	
	He tries not to cry, and shows her a space between his teeth.
	
	                    ROY
	          They knocked out my tooth!
	
	                    LILLY
	          Only one tooth?
	
	Roy's frustrated, unhappy, having nowhere else to turn.
	
	                    ROY
	          You always say that!
	
	Lilly won't take him seriously, but she relents enough to
	stop teasing him, and to pat his head, ignoring how he
	flinches away.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Come on, kid, let's see if there's
	          any food in the house.
	
	                    CLERK
	              (there's no food)
	          Hah.
	
	Lilly gives him a jaundiced look, walks Roy to the stairs and
	up. The clerk, scornful but sexually interested, watches her
	go.
	
	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
	
	ECU, Roy in a hospital bed, with more color in his face,
	breathing more normally. He begins to react to the sound of
	people speaking.
	
	                    MYRA (O.S.)
	          No, really, you're Roy's mother?
	          That's impossible!
	
	                    LILLY (O.S.)
	          Not quite. But I'm not sure who you
	          are, Mrs... Langtry, was it?
	
	Roy's eyes open, he looks toward the voices.
	
	                    MYRA (O.S.)
	          I'm Roy's friend.
	
	WIDE SHOT, Lilly and Myra facing one another across the foot
	of Roy's bed, in a two-bed hospital room. (The OLD MAN in the
	other bed sleeps through the scene.) Neither woman is yet
	aware that Roy's awake. Lilly looks Myra up and down, with
	obvious contempt.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Yes. I imagine you're lots of
	          people's friend.
	
	Myra moves one pace to the side, studying Lilly's face.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Oh, of course, now that I see you
	          in the light, you're plenty old
	          enough to be Roy's mother.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (sweet smile)
	          Aren't we all?
	
	                    ROY
	              (very weak, but amused)
	          Play nice. Don't fight.
	
	The women, startled, both move toward Roy, one on each side
	of the bed.
	
	THREE SHOT, Myra and Lilly both leaning over to look down at
	Roy's sleepy face.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Darling!
	
	                    LILLY
	          Roy. You're going to be all right.
	
	                    ROY
	          Sure I am. What made you turn up,
	          after all these years?
	
	                    LILLY
	          I'm working down in San Diego. Just
	          for a few weeks.
	              (awkward laugh)
	          Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost
	          son.
	
	                    ROY
	              (cold)
	          Nice to see you.
	              (turns to Myra)
	          What am I doing in here?
	
	                    MYRA
	          You were bleeding inside, honey.
	          Remember that bruise you had?
	
	                    ROY
	          You called the doctor, huh?
	
	                    MYRA
	              (reluctant)
	          Well, no, Roy. Your mother found
	          you.
	
	                    ROY
	              (tossing It away)
	          Oh, yeah?
	              (very casual, to Lilly)
	          Thanks.
	              (back to Myra)
	          How long do they say I'm in here?
	
	Myra's willing to fight with Lilly, but Roy's attitude toward
	his mother makes her uncomfortable.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Roy... Your mom saved your life.
	
	Roy turns his head, gives Lilly an ironic smile. Lilly waits,
	holding herself in.
	
	                    ROY
	          Yeah? Only one life?
	
	She nods, accepting that, but then responds.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Second time I gave it to you.
	
	Roy gives her a cold smile, then turns to Myra for the ironic
	explanation.
	
	                    ROY
	          I was kind of... inconvenient...
	          for Lilly.
	
	Lilly has nothing but contempt for Myra. To be humiliated in
	front of Myra -- and by her son -- is the worst thing that
	could happen to her. She makes as dignified an exit as she
	can.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Well... You're all right now, I
	          guess. I have to get down to the
	          track.
	
	                    ROY
	              (reluctant, but it's
	               necessary)
	          Thanks, uh, Lilly.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (awkward laugh)
	          Don't mention it.
	
	                    ROY
	          I guess I owe you my life.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (faint smile)
	          You always did.
	
	Lilly exits. Myra looks after her, curious.
	
	                    MYRA
	          "Down to the track?"
	
	Roy will not talk about this, with anyone. His response is
	cold, closing the subject.
	
	                    ROY
	          Her job.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (bright smile)
	          I want to know everything about
	          you.
	
	                    ROY
	              (easy grin)
	          You do. And once I'm out of here,
	          I'll remind you of the best parts.
	
	They smile flirtatiously at one another, both with their
	minds on other things.
	
	INT. BATHROOM - DAY
	
	Very messy, small. Myra showers. She finishes, emerges, wraps
	herself in a towel, opens the crowded messy medicine cabinet,
	removes cosmetics and other items, starts to tweeze her
	eyebrows. Doorbell RINGS. She looks irritated, ignores it.
	Long doorbell RING. Exasperated, she slaps the tweezers down,
	exits.
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
	
	Another furnished apartment, this one with Myra's clothing
	and dishes and glasses and other junk all over it.
	She crosses to the door, pulls it open. The APARTMENT MANAGER
	enters; a sullen, nervous, heavyset man.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (angry, but defensive)
	          You heard the shower, didn't you?
	
	                    MANAGER
	          I don't care about that. This time,
	          I gotta have the rent.
	
	Myra forces herself to be more pleasant.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Joe, I thought I was gonna be all 
	          right by now, I just need a little
	          more --
	
	                    MANAGER
	          It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my
	          wife. She knows what's going on.
	          This time, I gotta have the money.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Joe, you know you'll --
	
	In gesturing, Myra "accidentally" loses the towel, then wraps
	it around herself again as the manager stares nervously away.
	She smiles, knowing she's got him.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Joe, could we talk it over? Do you
	          want a drink?
	
	                    MANAGER
	          My wife sent me here, Myra. For the
	          money. She's waiting.
	
	                    MYRA
	          I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock?
	          Ten?
	
	                    MANAGER
	              (trying to be determined)
	          This time...
	
	                    MYRA
	          We'll work something out, Joe.
	
	She strokes his arm, smiling. He flees. She smiles till he's
	gone, then looks worried, leans her head against the door.
	
	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
	
	Roy, very comfortable in pajamas and robe, sits in a
	wheelchair beside the bed, with magazines lying handy on the
	bed. Myra, irritable, paces beside him.
	
	                    MYRA
	          I don't see why you're still here.
	          You look healthy to me.
	
	                    ROY
	          I just do what the doctor says,
	          babe.
	
	                    MYRA
	          You're just comfortable, that's
	          all. You don't even ask to go home.
	          You just lie around, let your mama
	          take care of you.
	
	                    ROY
	              (truly astonished)
	          Mama!
	
	                    MYRA
	          Who else is paying for all this?
	          You badmouth the woman all the
	          time, but you sure do take the
	          payoffs she gives you.
	
	                    ROY
	              (insulted)
	          I'll pay Lilly back, don't you
	          worry about that.
	
	                    MYRA
	          I don't like to come here, Roy.
	          Every time I do, your mother comes
	          in and makes remarks.
	
	                    ROY
	          That's just Lilly's way.
	
	                    MYRA
	          And you never defend me. You're
	          afraid of her.
	
	                    ROY
	          Oh, don't be stupid.
	
	                    MYRA
	          You're a mama's boy, if you want
	          the truth. 
	
	This is so absurd, Roy doesn't know how to respond.
	
	                    ROY
	          Are you kid --? I hadn't even seen
	          her in seven years!
	
	Lilly enters, smiling in self-confidence. A large ugly burn
	is on the back of her right hand.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Should my ears be burning?
	
	                    MYRA
	              (surly)
	          They might as well.
	
	Lilly gives her a mock-admiring look.
	
	                    LILLY
	          I heard those skirts were coming
	          back.
	
	Myra's not quite up to direct confrontation with Lilly. She
	glowers at Roy instead.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Get well soon.
	
	                    ROY
	              (easy)
	          Every day in every way.
	
	                    MYRA
	          I'll see you when you get home.
	
	Myra stalks out. Acting as though Myra hadn't existed, Lilly
	puts her bag on the bed, takes mail from it.
	
	                    ROY
	          What happened to your hand?
	
	                    LILLY
	              (casually dismissive)
	          Just a little accident. I went by
	          your place, picked up your mall.
	          Just bills, I'll take care of them.
	
	                    ROY
	          I can take care of my own bills,
	          Lilly.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (indifferent shrug)
	          Whatever you say. The manager says
	          your boss called.
	              (crooked grin)
	          Really pulled the wool over
	          everybody's eyes, huh?
	
	                    ROY
	          What are you talking about? So I've
	          got a job. So what?
	
	                    LILLY
	          Stop kidding me! Four years in a
	          town like Los Ang-gleez, and a
	          peanut selling job is the best you
	          can do? You expect me to believe
	          that?
	
	                    ROY
	              (spreads hands; it's
	               obvious)
	          It's there. The boss called, you
	          said so yourself.
	
	                    LILLY
	          And that dump you live in! Those
	          clown pictures on the walls!
	
	This reference alerts and worries Roy, which he tries to
	hide.
	
	                    ROY
	          I like those.
	
	                    LILLY
	          You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball
	          clown pictures? Commission
	          salesman? It's all a front, isn't
	          it? You're on the grift, I know you
	          are. You're working some angle, and
	          don't tell me you're not because I
	          wrote the book!
	
	                    ROY
	              (defensive)
	          You're one to talk. Still running
	          playback money for the mob.
	
	                    LILLY
	          That's me. That's who I am. You
	          were never cut out for the rackets,
	          Roy, and if you --
	
	                    ROY
	          How come?
	
	She considers him. His expression is jaunty, daring her. She
	gives him a somber answer.
	
	                    LILLY
	          You aren't tough enough.
	
	He's afraid she's right. He covers the doubt with a display
	of self-assurance.
	
	                    ROY
	          Not as tough as you, huh?
	
	                    LILLY
	              (dead serious)
	          No. And you have to be.
	
	She holds up her burned hand, showing it to him.
	
	                    LILLY
	          You asked me about this. You really
	          want to know what happened?
	
	He isn't sure he does; but what choice does he have?
	
	                    ROY
	          Up to you.
	
	                    LILLY
	          My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus,
	          back in Baltimore. When a long shot
	          gets too much action, I have to put
	          money on that horse at the track,
	          because it's the only way to get
	          the odds down.
	
	                    ROY
	          Sure.
	
	                    LILLY
	          The first day of the Delmar meet,
	          there was a nag called Bluebell. I
	          should have been on it. But that
	          was the day after you came in here,
	          so I stuck around to see how you
	          were gonna be.
	
	He would speak protest, deny, explain, but she cuts him off.
	
	                    LILLY
	          That was my choice, nothing to do
	          with you. I took a chance, and it
	          didn't work out.
	
	                    ROY
	          Bluebell came in?
	
	                    LILLY
	          I sent Bobo ten grand of my own
	          money, like it was the winnings
	          from my bets. I hoped that would
	          cover me.
	              (shrug)
	          It didn't.
	
	EXT. DELMAR DAY
	
	AN ANGLE on the exit doors toward the parking lot. Lilly
	comes out, self-absorbed, then sees something ahead of her,
	falters briefly, keeps walking, tries a very shaky smile.
	
	REVERSE ANGLE, as Lilly approaches her car. BOBO JUSTUS, 50,
	a blunt hoodlum in a good suit and a civilized veneer, stands
	leaning against the car, arms folded, squinting behind
	sunglasses.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Hi, Bobo.
	
	                    BOBO
	          Did I buy you that dress, you piece
	          of shit?
	
	Lilly's scared, startled, but trying to figure out how to
	play this.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Well, I guess so. You're the guy I
	          work for.
	
	                    BOBO
	          You work for me, huh? Then I just
	          may flush you down the toilet.
	          Drive me to the Durando.
	
	Bobo gets into the passenger seat, while Lilly nods
	convulsive agreement and hurries around to get behind the
	wheel. The car jolts forward, then smooths, and heads for the
	gate.
	
	INT. CHRYSLER - DAY
	
	Driving along the highway. Lilly concentrates on traffic.
	Bobo heavily watches her profile, finally speaks.
	
	                    BOBO
	          Bluebell.
	
	Lilly's eyes briefly close, her shoulders sag. Then she goes
	back to the silent alert person she'd been. Bobo nods.
	
	                    BOBO
	          How'd you figure you were gonna get
	          away with that?
	
	                    LILLY
	          I'm not getting away with anything,
	          Bobo.
	
	                    BOBO
	          You're fuckin right you're not. How
	          much did your pals cut you in for
	          on that nag, huh? Or did they give
	          you the same kind of screwing you
	          gave me?
	
	                    LILLY
	          I was down on that horse, Bobo. Not
	          as much as I should have been, but
	          there was a lot of action on those--
	
	Bobo taps a fingertip against the side of her head to shut
	her up. She shuts up.
	
	                    BOBO
	          One question. Do you want to stick
	          to that story, or do you want to
	          keep your teeth?
	
	                    LILLY
	          I want to keep my teeth.
	
	                    BOBO
	          Now I'll ask you another. You think
	          I got no contacts out here? That
	          nag paid off at just the opening
	          price. There wasn't hardly a
	          flutter on the tote board from the
	          time the odds were posted. There
	          ain't enough action to tickle the
	          tote, but you claim a ten grand
	          win!
	          You send me ten thousand dollars,
	          like I'm some mark you can blow
	          off!
	
	                    LILLY
	              (terrified, broken)
	          Bobo, no, I --
	
	                    BOBO
	          You wanna talk to me straight up?
	
	                    LILLY
	          My son --
	
	                    BOBO
	          Your what?
	
	                    LILLY
	          My son was in the hospital --
	
	                    BOBO
	          What the fuck are you doin with a
	          son?
	
	                    LILLY
	          He left home a long time ago. He
	          was in the hospital, up in Los Ang
	          gleez, real sick.
	
	                    BOBO
	              (utter scorn)
	          Motherhood.
	
	                    LILLY
	          I never fucked up before, Bobo.
	
	                    BOBO
	          You expect me to buy this?
	
	It's time for Lilly to show tough, and she knows it.
	
	                    LILLY
	          You do buy it, Bobo. I cost you,
	          and I'm sorry.
	
	Bobo thinks this over.
	
	                    BOBO
	          I got a lot of people work for me,
	          Lilly. I can't have shit like this.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (begging)
	          It'll never happen again. I swear.
	
	                    BOBO
	          It happened once. With me, that's
	          making a habit of it.
	
	Lilly drops back to her final position; fatalism.
	
	                    LILLY
	          You're calling the shots.
	
	                    BOBO
	          You got any kind of long coat in
	          the car? Anything you can wear home
	          over your clothes?
	
	                    LILLY
	              (deadened with fear)
	          No.
	
	                    BOBO
	              (doesn't matter)
	          I'll loan you a raincoat.
	
	Lilly drives, holding herself together.
	
	EXT. HOTEL DURANDO - DAY
	
	A tall expensive hotel on the coast north of San Diego.
	CAMERA PANS with the Chrysler pulling in and stopping at the
	entrance, then PANS UP the balconied facade.
	
	INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY
	
	Living room of a high-floor suite. CAMERA FACES across the
	room to the balcony and the view of the ocean. Entrance door
	to one side. A supermarket shopping bag is on the coffee
	table. Two THUGS sit on the sofa, watching TV.
	
	The door opens and Lilly enters, followed by Bobo. The thugs
	immediately rise and switch off the TV.
	
	                    BOBO
	              (to the thugs)
	          Take a walk.
	
	The thugs leave the room as Lilly crosses to stand between US
	and the view, followed by Bobo, neither looking out. Lilly
	turns to Bobo, who abruptly punches her hard in the stomach.
	She falls to the floor.
	
	ANOTHER ANGLE as Bobo steps across her and goes over to close
	the drapes over the view. Lilly sits up, watching him,
	waiting obediently. Bobo looks at her.
	
	                    BOBO (CONT'D)
	          Get me a bath towel.
	
	She gets up, hurting, and hurries to the bathroom. Bobo sits
	on the sofa, crosses his ankles on the coffee table next to
	the supermarket bag. He takes out and lights a cigar. Lilly
	comes back with a large white bath towel.
	
	                    BOBO (CONT'D)
	          You ever hear about the oranges?
	
	                    LILLY
	          You mean, the insurance frammis?
	
	                    BOBO
	          Tell me about the oranges, Lilly.
	
	He kicks over the supermarket bag. Oranges roll on the floor.
	
	                    BOBO (CONT'D)
	          While you put those in the towel.
	
	Lilly's very scared. She drops to her knees, spreads the
	towel, crawls around gathering oranges while she talks.
	
	                    LILLY
	          You hit a person with the oranges
	          in the towel, they get big, awful
	          looking bruises, but they don't
	          really get hurt, not if you do it
	          right. It's for working scams
	          against insurance companies.
	
	                    BOBO 
	          And if you do it wrong?
	
	                    LILLY
	          It can louse up your insides. You
	          can get puh, puh, puh...
	
	                    BOBO
	              (impatient)
	          What's that, Lilly?
	
	Lilly pauses, bent over, tightly holding an orange.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Permanent damage.
	
	                    BOBO 
	          You'll never shit right again.
	
	He gets to his feet, leaving his cigar in an ashtray.
	
	                    BOBO (CONT'D)
	              (hard, impatient)
	          Bring me the towel.
	
	Fumbling slightly, she folds the towel edges together to make
	a bag, then stands, brings the towel to Bobo. He makes a
	production out of getting his grip on the edges just right.
	She stands as limp as she can, just wanting to get through
	this. He looks at her without expression, rears back with the
	towel, swings it forward, lets it drop open. Oranges roll on
	the floor. Lilly stares, wide-eyed, recognizing reprieve.
	Bobo tosses the towel behind him onto the sofa, then gestures
	contemptuously for her to pick up the oranges again.
	
	TWO SHOT, closer, as Lilly turns, bending toward the oranges,
	and Bobo picks up his cigar, then lifts a foot and kicks her
	flatfooted, hard, in the back. She sprawls on the floor. He
	follows and drops to his knees on her back.
	
	AN ANGLE close on Lilly on the floor, Bobo's knees grinding
	back and forth into her back.
	
	AN ANGLE on Bobo, grimacing as he bears down, pressing his
	weight onto her back. He leans forward, left hand bracing
	himself on the floor beside her head as he reaches down with
	the cigar held in his right hand and presses the ember
	against the back of her splayed-out right hand.
	
	ECU, Lilly, clenching her teeth, tears squeezing from her
	eyes, simply bearing it.
	
	AN ANGLE on Bobo, catching a bad smell, looking back down
	behind himself at Lilly's body. This is the result he wanted,
	but it disgusts him. He straightens up, still kneeling on
	her, puts the cigar in his mouth, doesn't like its taste,
	removes it, braces his left hand against her back while he
	lifts off her, getting back up onto his feet.
	
	WIDE SHOT, Bobo stepping over her, expression repulsed.
	
	                    BOBO (CONT'D)
	          Go clean yourself up.
	
	He puts the cigar back in the ashtray as she rises, cradling
	her burnt hand. Not looking toward Bobo, hobbling with knees
	together, she starts from the room.
	
	                    BOBO (CONT'D)
	          The raincoat's on the bed.
	
	She leaves. He opens the drapes, then picks up an orange from
	the floor and steps out onto the balcony.
	
	EXT. BALCONY - DAY
	
	Bobo stands looking out at the ocean. He enjoys breathing the
	sea air. He slowly peels the orange, dropping pieces of peel
	over the side.
	
	Lilly appears in the doorway, wearing a too-large man's
	raincoat. Bobo doesn't seem to notice her at first, then nods
	to her.
	
	                    BOBO
	          Almost forgot. That ten grand of
	          yours. It's in the envelope by the
	          door.
	
	                    LILLY 
	              (tries for animation)
	          Oh, thanks, Bobo.
	
	                    BOBO
	          You want a drink?
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I
	          still gotta drive back up to Los
	          Ang-gleez.
	
	                    BOBO 
	          See your son, huh? Well, that's
	          nice. A side of you I didn't know,
	          Lilly.
	
	Lilly chances taking a step out onto the balcony. It's vital
	that she encourage this forgive-and-forget dialogue.
	
	                    LILLY
	          He's a good kid. A salesman.
	
	                    BOBO 
	          On the square, huh? And how are you
	          making out these days? Stealing
	          much?
	
	Bobo's being jolly now. Lilly's scared, but has to be jolly,
	too.
	
	                    LILLY
	          From you? My folks didn't raise any
	          stupid kids.
	
	Bobo's joshing now. He raises a humorous eyebrow.
	
	                    BOBO 
	          Not skimming a thing, Lilly?
	
	                    LILLY
	          Oh, well, you know. I just clip a
	          buck here and a buck there. Not
	          enough to notice.
	
	                    BOBO
	              (honest approval)
	          That's right. Take a little, leave
	          a little.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          A person that don't look out for
	          himself is too dumb to look out for
	          anybody else. He's a liability,
	          right, Bobo?
	
	                    BOBO
	              (this is his creed)
	          You're a thousand percent right!
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Or else he's working an angle. If
	          he doesn't steal a little, he's
	          steeling big.
	
	                    BOBO 
	          You know it, Lilly.
	
	                    LILLY
	          You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I
	          don't know what there is about it,
	          but it somehow makes you look
	          taller.
	
	                    BOBO
	              (delighted)
	          Yeah? You really think so? A lot of
	          people been telling me the same
	          thing.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Well, you can tell them I said
	          they're right.
	              (looks at sky)
	          I better get going. Roy'll wonder
	          where I am.
	
	                    BOBO 
	          Worries about his mother, eh? Give
	          him a hug for me.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          I will. So long, Bobo.
	
	Lilly leaves the balcony. Bobo eats more orange, looking out
	at the ocean. His expression is stern but calm.
	
	INT. CHRYSLER - DAY
	
	Lilly drives along the highway, weeping, shaking, teeth
	chattering. Her hands are both high on the wheel, the back of
	the right hand developing a large red burn.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Lucky! Lucky! Oh, am I lucky.! Am I
	          lucky!
	
	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
	
	Roy's appalled and embarrassed and ashamed by this story; the
	surface result is, he's mad at Lilly.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Lucky? You call that lucky?
	
	                    LILLY
	              (simply)
	          He let me live. He let me be his
	          friend.
	
	Roy in his agitation wheels himself back and forth in the
	wheelchair, bumping into things.
	
	                    ROY 
	          You don't put up with that! Nobody
	          has to put up with that!
	
	                    LILLY
	          You do if you're where I am. Where
	          you want to be. How'd you get that
	          punch in the stomach, Roy?
	
	He closes down, sullen, not caring if she believes him or
	not.
	
	                    ROY 
	          I tripped over a chair.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (calm maternal advice)
	          Get off the grift, Roy.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Why?
	
	                    LILLY (CONT'D)
	              (faint smile)
	          You don't have the stomach for it.
	
	He stares at her, hurt and angry. She stares back,
	unflinching. Angrily, he spins the wheelchair around, his
	back to her.
	
	Now she's hurt. She shrugs, speaks indifferently to his back.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          I just give you your life. What you
	          do with it is up to you.
	
	                    ROY
	              (his back turned)
	          That's right.
	
	She hesitates, then stalks out, shutting the door.
	
	Hearing the door close, Roy spins around in the wheelchair to
	face where she'd been. He starts to get up, pauses midway.

	Roy, on his feet now, stands still, indecisive.
	
	INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY
	
	Lilly shakes her head, turns firmly away, marches down the
	corridor.
	
	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
	
	Roy makes an angry gesture, drops back into the wheelchair,
	spins it around and wheels over to the phone. Quick and
	angry, he makes a call. SOUND of ring; SOUND of click.
	
	                    MYRA  (V.O.)
	              (filtered; little-girl
	               flirtatious)
	          Myra here. Sorry you missed me.
	          Tell me how to reach you and I
	          will, just as soon as I can.
	
	SOUND of answering machine beep.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Babe, I'm gettin out of here, and
	          that's it. Let's take some time out
	          this weekend, go down to LaJolla,
	          hit the beach, have some fun.
	          Forget all this other stuff, huh?
	
	Roy hangs up, sits in the wheelchair looking determined.
	
	INT. MADERO LOBBY - DAY
	
	Simms talks with a MAID.
	
	                    SIMMS
	          Your difference between your folded
	          towel and your clean towel is a
	          trip to the laundry. When you're
	          cleaning those bathrooms, what you
	          do, you pick up the towel, you give
	          it a good shake and a good look,
	          and you say to yourself, 'Would I
	          dry myself on this towel?' If the
	          answer's yes, fold it.
	
	Roy comes out of the elevator, crossing toward Simms.
	
	                    MAID 
	          What if it's wet?
	
	                    SIMMS
	          Mr. Dillon! Welcome back! You look
	          fine, just fine.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Thanks, Mr. Simms, I'm feeling
	          fine.
	
	                    MAID 
	              (shy)
	          I'm glad you're better.
	
	Simms hands Roy a stack of mail.
	
	                    SIMMS
	          You're well liked around here, Mr.
	          Dillon. The entire staff will be
	          pleased to see you're back.
	
	Roy's touched and embarrassed by this reaction.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Well, thank you. And thank them.
	
	                    SIMMS 
	          Sickness comes to us all, Mister
	          Dillon.
	
	                    ROY 
	          That's true, Mr. Simms.
	
	                    SIMMS
	          We never know when and we never
	          know why. We never know how. The
	          only blessed thing we know is,
	          it'll be at the most inconvenient
	          and unexpected time. Just when
	          you've got tickets to the World
	          Series. And that's the way the
	          permanent waves.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Well, I'm back now. I just wanted
	          you to know. Gotta rush.
	
	                    SIMMS
	          Happy to see you looking so good.
	
	Roy crosses back to the elevator, enters it. Elevator door
	closes. Simms looks after him, avuncular.
	
	                    SIMMS (CONT'D)
	          That fellow could be a congressman.
	              (turns to maid)
	          If it's wet, you don't fold it. You
	          shake it, and hang it neatly on the
	          rod provided.

	A long low stucco building in an industrial section of Los
	Angeles. The company name is on the glass of the main door.
	KAGGS, a humorless hotshot of 28, dressed in short-sleeved
	white shirt and narrow dark tie, prowls the cracked sidewalk
	in front of the place, MAKING REMARKS into a small cassette
	recorder. Roy's Honda arrives and drives into the company lot
	at the end of the building. Kaggs watches, then goes on
	patrolling and TALKING into the recorder. Roy comes out to
	the sidewalk and heads for the entrance. Kaggs stops and
	watches him approach.
	
	                    ROY
	              (cheerful, confident)
	          Whadaya say?
	
	                    KAGGS
	              (uptight, minimal)
	          Hello.
	
	Roy continues on and enters the building.
	
	INT. SARBER & WEBB - DAY
	
	A low rail separates the visitors from an area of desks with
	CLERKS typing or adding up figures or TALKING on the phone.
	Beyond them are floor-to-ceiling bins and shelves with narrow
	aisles between, in which more CLERKS move busily, filling
	orders or doing inventory. A great sense of activity and
	hubbub. Roy enters, looks around in surprise. A clerk at a
	front desk sees him, stands happily.
	
	                    CLERK 
	          Roy! Welcome back.
	
	                    ROY
	              (approaching him)
	          What's going on? This is usually
	          coffee break time.
	
	                    CLERK 
	          Not since Kaggs showed up.
	
	Other clerks, aware of Roy, come over with AD LIB GREETINGS.
	
	                    ROY
	              (happily basking)
	          Hey, yeah, I'm fine, everything's
	          great. What's this Kaggs? Sounds
	          like a disease.
	
	                    2ND CLERK 
	          It is.
	
	                    CLERK 
	          Troubleshooter from the main
	          office. Came out here right after
	          you went into the hospital, and he
	          ain't had a kind word for anybody
	          yet.
	
	                    3RD CLERK 
	          Nobody knows anything but him.
	
	                    CLERK 
	          He chopped off half a dozen
	          salesmen; won't wholesale to them
	          any more.
	
	                    2ND CLERK 
	          What kind of sense does that make?
	          They're all on commission.
	
	                    ROY
	              (unworried)
	          You think he'll chop me?
	
	                    CLERK
	          If he does, he's crazy.
	
	                    2ND CLERK 
	          Here he comes!
	
	The clerks all hurry back to their desks as Kaggs enters. He
	crosses to Roy, hand stuck out.
	
	                    KAGGS
	          Kaggs. Home office.

	                    KAGGS
	              (keeping Roy's hand)
	          I know that. Knew it when I saw you
	          out there. The best salesman here,
	          which isn't saying much. Want to
	          talk to you, Dillon.
	
	Kaggs moves toward the gate in the rail, still holding Roy's
	hand, to move him along. Roy stands still, which yanks Kaggs
	back. Kaggs frowns at him, releases his hand.
	
	                    KAGGS (CONT'D)
	          What's up?
	
	                    ROY 
	          That was a pretty backhanded
	          compliment. If I let people get
	          away with things like that, I
	          wouldn't be a good salesman.
	
	                    KAGGS
	              (brisk)
	          You're right. I apologize. But I
	          still want to talk to you.

	Small, crowded, efficient, with interior windows showing the
	aisles of bins. Kaggs leads Roy in, shuts the door, gestures
	at the second chair as he goes behind the desk.
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          Take a seat.
	
	They both sit, Roy amused and observant.
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          When I said you being the best
	          salesman here didn't say much, I
	          meant for us. I know your record
	          with Sarber and Webb, and I'd say
	          you're a top-flight man, but you've
	          had no incentive. No one walking on
	          your heels. Just a lot of half
	          asses, so the tendency's been not
	          to stretch yourself. I'm bouncing
	          the slobs, incidentally.
	
	                    ROY 
	              (dry)
	          So I heard.
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          Makes no difference to me if
	          they're only on commission. If they
	          don't make good money, they're not
	          giving us good representation, and
	          we can't afford to have them
	          around. Ever supervise salesmen?
	
	                    ROY 
	          Just myself.
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          That's right, you've had to
	          supervise yourself. This place
	          needs a sales manager. Somebody
	          who's proved he's a salesman and
	          can handle other salesmen. He'd
	          have a lot of deadwood to clear
	          out, new men to hire. What do you
	          think?
	
	Roy doesn't yet know he's being offered the job.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Sounds like a good Idea.
	
	                    KAGGS
	          I don't know offhand what your best
	          year's been, we can look it up. The
	          idea is, we'll top it by fifteen
	          percent.
	
	Now Roy gets it. He's startled, almost scared, thinks
	automatically of escape.
	
	                    ROY 
	          What? Me?
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          That's just the first year. If you
	          aren't worth a lot more than that
	          the second year, I'll kick you out.
	          What do you say?
	
	                    ROY 
	          Well, uh... No.
	
	                    KAGGS
	              (astonished)
	          No?
	
	                    ROY 
	          I can't take that job! I mean, I
	          mean, I can't take it right away.
	          I'm still recuperating, I just
	          dropped in to say hello, see
	          everybody --
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look
	          a little pale. How soon will you be
	          ready? A week?
	
	                    ROY 
	          But you need a man right now. It
	          wouldn't be fair to you to --
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          I take care of the being-fair-to-me
	          department. Things've gone to hell
	          this long, they can go a little
	          longer.
	
	                    ROY
	              (trapped)
	          Well...
	
	Kaggs gets to his feet, terminating the meeting.
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          See you in a week, Roy. I can call
	          you Roy?
	
	                    ROY
	              (rising)
	          Oh, sure. Fine.
	
	Kaggs sticks his hand out for another shake. Roy obliges.
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm
	          afraid.
	
	                    ROY
	              (distracted)
	          Perk.
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
	
	Roy's place. Roy enters from the bedroom, carrying a
	suitcase, which he drops on the sofa. He goes to one of the
	box-framed clown pictures, takes it off the wall, puts it
	face down on the coffee table, removes two wing nuts holding
	the back, lifts off the back, and reveals stacks of money
	hidden inside. He takes two wads of money out, counting them,
	putting them on the coffee table, then fits the back in
	place, reattaches the wing nuts, and hangs the picture on the
	wall. Stuffing the wads of money into the suitcase, he
	leaves.
	
	EXT. UNION STATION - DAY
	
	A cab pulls up to discharge passengers. Roy and the DRIVER
	get out. Roy pays the driver, who opens the trunk to take out
	several pieces of luggage. Myra leans hesitantly out, as
	though afraid it's raining out there.
	
	                    ROY 
	          This really is it. Union Station.
	
	Myra comes out of the cab. She's feeling testy. Roy's in a
	good mood and ignores her bad temper.
	
	                    MYRA
	          I don't see why we have to take the
	          train.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Because it's comfortable.
	
	Myra and Roy burden themselves with the luggage.
	
	                    MYRA
	          What if we want to drive somewhere
	          while we're there?
	
	                    ROY
	          We'll rent a car.
	
	They start for the station.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Big spender.
	
	                    ROY
	          You ain't seen nothin.
	
	INT. TRAIN DAY
	
	AN ANGLE from outside the passenger car through the window at
	Myra, mulish, watching the scenery go by. Beyond her Roy's
	easy, content. He moves to get up.
	
	TWO SHOT, within the train. Myra looks questioningly at Roy
	as he stands.
	
	                    ROY
	          Stretch my legs. Come along?
	
	She's not ready to relent and enjoy herself.
	
	                    MYRA
	          No.
	
	                    ROY
	              (unruffled)
	          See you soon.
	
	He walks down the aisle behind Myra, who sighs and looks out
	the window again.
	
	INT. BAR CAR - DAY
	
	Four young SOLDIERS sit at a table in a rudimentary bar car.
	They're drinking bloody Marys out of plastic glasses and
	having a good time together. In b.g., several customers are
	clustered at the small service bar, waiting for drinks.
	
	AN ANGLE on Roy, at the service bar, looking back past other
	people at the soldiers. He gets his mixed drink, in a plastic
	glass, and turns away.
	
	AN ANGLE on the soldiers as Roy starts by. The train lurches,
	and Roy falls heavily against their table, slopping their
	drinks and spilling some of his own on the table.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Oh! Ow, I'm sorry! Oh, look, I
	          spilled your drinks!
	
	                    SOLDIER
	          That's okay, don't worry about it.
	
	                    SOLDIER 2
	          You okay, pal?
	
	                    ROY
	          Let me buy you a new round.
	
	                    SOLDIER
	          Hey, no, no problem.
	
	                    SOLDIER 3
	          You didn't like spill much at all.
	
	Roy firmly places his own glass on their table.
	
	                    ROY 
	          What are those, bloody Marys? Watch
	          this, I'll be back.
	
	He leaves, while the soldiers are still PROTESTING.
	
	INT. TRAIN - DAY
	
	Myra applies makeup, watching herself in her compact mirror.
	She becomes aware of eyes, and looks around.
	
	TWO SHOT, Myra and a BUSINESSMAN, sitting across the way,
	grinning at her. Myra registers him.
	
	CU, Myra, considering the possibilities. Then she shrugs,
	shakes her head at the businessman almost reluctantly, and
	goes back to applying makeup.
	
	INT. BAR CAR - DAY
	
	Roy now sits with the soldiers, eagerly listening to them
	talk. There are plastic glasses enough on the table for three
	rounds of drinks.
	
	                    SOLDIER 3
	              (to Soldier 2)
	          Yeah, but it was you like told the
	          sergeant your grandmother was dead.
	
	                    SOLDIER
	              (laughing)
	          Again!
	
	                    SOLDIER 2
	              (to Soldier 3)
	          And you jumped right in.
	              (broad imitation)
	          I'll drive him, Sarge, he's too
	          distraught.
	
	                    SOLDIER 4
	              (astonished)
	          Distraught? You said distraught?
	
	They all laugh, Roy laughing with them.
	
	                    ROY
	          Boy! You guys could've got in a lot
	          of trouble.
	
	                    SOLDIER 3
	          Nah. Old Sarge, he's slowing down.
	
	                    ROY
	          I don't know. I wouldn't take a
	          chance like that.
	              (looks at floor)
	          What's that?
	
	They watch as he bends, picks up one die from the floor,
	holds it where they can all see it, his manner open,
	guileless.
	
	                    ROY (CONT'D)
	          One of you fellows drop this?
	
	INT. TRAIN - DAY
	
	Myra walks down the aisle, demurely looking at no one.
	
	INT. BAR CAR - DAY
	
	Roy's getting to his feet, the soldiers protesting.
	
	                    SOLDIER 2
	          You can't buy every round!
	
	                    SOLDIER 3 
	          Like our turn!
	
	                    ROY 
	          Tell you what. We'll roll for it.
	          Low number buys.
	
	He hands the die to Soldier 2.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Go ahead. You roll for the four of
	          you.
	
	The soldiers are confused but agreeable, seeing this as some
	kind of fun.
	
	                    SOLDIER 2 
	          Here goes.
	
	He tosses the die on the table.
	
	                    SOLDIER 3 
	          That's a four!
	
	Roy picks up the die.
	
	AN ANGLE close on Roy, his eyes glittering, his fist with the
	die shaking beside his head.
	
	WIDE SHOT. Roy throws. They all look at the die. Roy spreads
	his hands; the good sport.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Told you I'd buy.
	
	                    SOLDIER 
	          It just doesn't seem fair, Tom.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Tell you what. Give me a chance to
	          get even when I come back.
	
	INT. TRAIN - DAY
	
	Myra reaches the end of one car, starts through.
	
	INT. BAR CAR - DAY
	
	AN ANGLE on Myra about to enter. She stops, looking through
	the glass in the door.
	
	Myra's POV: Roy and the soldiers rolling the die for money.
	
	ECU, Myra, absorbed, watching.
	
	Myra's POV: MOS through the glass. ECU, Roy's hand with the
	die. ECU, Roy's profile, his smile, his innocent distress
	when he wins. ECU, Roy's hand scoops money.
	
	ECU, Myra, smiling, pleased.
	
	INT. DINER - NIGHT
	
	A brightly lit Hopperish place. Lilly sits alone in a booth
	eating a bowl of chili and reading a newspaper folded beside
	the bowl. A DRUNK with a great deal of faith in his own charm
	sits with a male FRIEND at the counter, drinking coffee. The
	drunk keeps looking toward Lilly, grinning, COMMENTING
	playfully to his friend, who's bored by it all. Lilly doesn't
	seem to be aware of him.
	
	The drunk rises from his stool, turning toward Lilly,
	staggering slightly. His friend makes a small move to stop
	him, then shrugs and lets him go. The drunk makes his way to
	Lilly's table, leans on it.
	
	                    DRUNK 
	          Pretty woman like you shouldn't eat
	          alone. Whadaya wanna eat alone for?
	
	Lilly gives him a flat look.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Go away.
	
	She looks past him toward the WAITRESS behind the counter.
	
	                    LILLY (CONT'D)
	              (calling)
	          Could I have some coffee, please?
	
	                    WAITRESS 
	          Right away.
	
	                    DRUNK 
	          We could have coffee together. My
	          name's Kenny.
	
	Lilly looks over at the drunk's friend, who pointedly ignores
	the situation.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Your pal wants you.
	
	The drunk could turn mean; his gesture brushing away the idea
	of his friend is stronger than necessary.
	
	                    DRUNK
	          Let him find his own pretty woman.
	
	The waitress arrives, with the coffee pot and a mug. She puts
	the mug on the table, pours coffee.
	
	                    WAITRESS
	          This fellow bothering you, Ma'am?
	
	                    LILLY
	          Yes.
	
	                    WAITRESS
	              (to the drunk)
	          Why don't you go sit down?
	
	                    DRUNK
	          I'll sit here. Move over.
	
	The drunk wants to sit beside Lilly, who looks to the
	waitress to solve the problem, but the waitress stands there
	with the coffee pot, looking helpless. The drunk bends to
	slide onto the seat. Lilly, exasperated, rabbit punches him
	in the throat.
	
	The drunk, astounded and in pain (and not breathing),
	staggers back, flailing, hitting the waitress's arm so that
	she slops coffee on him as his feet tangle and he falls
	heavily onto the floor.
	
	Lilly, suddenly concerned, slides out of the booth.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Oh! Are you all right?
	
	She goes to one knee beside the drunk, who clutches his own
	throat with both hands, retching as he tries to inhale. Lilly
	looks up at the astonished waitress.
	
	                    LILLY (CONT'D)
	          I shouldn't have hit him that hard.
	          I guess I don't know my own
	          strength.
	
	The drunk's friend arrives and helps Lilly get the drunk to
	his feet. The drunk is breathing now, but shaken. He looks at
	Lilly with reproachful eyes. His friend transfers his
	annoyance at the drunk to Lilly.
	
	                    FRIEND 
	          You didn't have to do that.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (matter of fact)
	          I thought I did. You should take
	          better care of your friend.
	
	                    DRUNK
	              (mumbled)
	          Outta here.
	
	The drunk and his friend head for the exit, as Lilly turns to
	the waitress.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          I'm sorry a lady can't eat in here
	          without being bothered.
	
	The waitress is apologetic, and also in awe of Lilly.
	
	                    WAITRESS 
	          It won't happen again, Ma'am, I
	          promise. Dinner's on the house.
	          More chili? Dessert? We have lovely
	          pecan pie, my husband makes it
	          himself.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          That sounds nice. Pecan pie. Thank
	          you.
	
	Lilly sits down as the waitress goes back behind the counter.
	
	AN ANGLE on the waitress, as she puts down the coffee pot,
	brings out the pecan pie, prepares to slice it, pauses, looks
	with wonder toward Lilly.
	
	EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
	
	The setting is a wide porch or lanai pretending to be a 19th
	century locale; a mix of western and antebellum south; the
	usual tourist confusion of histories. The effect is both
	romantic and false. Roy and Myra linger over wine, near the
	end of their meal. Roy's relaxed, happy, expansive. Myra's
	pleased but watchful, the bird watching the worm.
	
	                    ROY 
	          You were right, I had to get out of
	          that hospital. Nothing wrong with
	          me any more.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (purring)
	          I'll sign that affidavit.
	
	                    ROY
	          Great to get away, take it easy.
	          Next week, I'll get back to work.
	
	                    MYRA
	          You already went back to work.
	
	                    ROY
	              (confused)
	          What?
	
	                    MYRA
	              (indulgent smile)
	          I watched you. Working the tap on
	          those soldier boys.
	
	                    ROY
	              (elaborate innocence)
	          Working the what?
	
	                    MYRA
	          Oh, come on, Roy.
	
	She mimes rolling the die, slowly, showing how it will roll
	out of her hand just so, then speaks to him as though to a
	bright child.
	
	                    MYRA
	          The tap. What you do for a living.
	
	                    ROY
	          I'm a salesman.
	
	                    MYRA
	          You're on the grift. Same as me.
	
	                    ROY
	              (demonstrating patience)
	          Myra, I'm not following this.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (demonstrating
	               exasperation)
	          Roy, you're a short-con operator.
	          And a good one, I think. Don't talk
	          to me like I'm another square.
	
	Roy leans back, studying her, thinking it over, makes up his
	mind.
	
	                    ROY 
	          You talk the lingo. What's your
	          pitch?
	
	                    MYRA 
	          The long end. Big con.
	
	                    ROY
	              (shaking his head)
	          Nobody does that single-o.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          I was teamed ten years with the
	          best in the business. Cole Langley.
	
	                    ROY 
	          I've heard the name.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          It was beautiful. And getting
	          better all the time.
	
	                    ROY
	              (skeptical)
	          Is that right?
	
	                    MYRA
	              (enthusiasm building)
	          It is, Roy! And now, right now,
	          it's the perfect time, the best
	          time since I've been in the game.
	
	EXT. DESERTED DOWNTOWN - DAY
	
	New skyscrapers are separated by blank fields or small older
	buildings. Almost no traffic. A white limo drives alone down
	the street.
	
	                    MYRA (V.O.) 
	          All over the southwest, you've got
	          these businessmen, they were making
	          money when everybody was making
	          money, they think that means
	          they're smart.
	
	INT. LIMO - DAY
	
	Myra, dressed expensively and fashionably, sits with
	GLOUCESTER HEBBING, a stocky businessman, sixtyish. Their
	manner suggests intimacy.
	
	                    MYRA (V.O.)
	          And now they're hurting. Everything
	          they had was because of oil.
	
	EXT. NEW BUILDING - DAY
	
	Glossy, but no people around. The limo stops, the mustached
	CHAUFFEUR hops out and holds the door as Myra and Hebbing
	emerge and cross to enter the building, Myra carrying an
	attache case.
	
	                    MYRA (V.O.)
	          They still got money, but they need
	          more money, and that's just the
	          kind of guy Cole and me like.
	
	INT. LIMO - DAY
	
	The chauffeur gets back behind the wheel, adjusts the
	interior mirror so he can see himself, peels off his
	moustache, scratches his upper lip, refits the moustache more
	to his liking.
	
	INT. ATRIUM - DAY
	
	This building has a central atrium with corridors circling
	it, waist-high walls on the atrium side, glass-walled
	elevators rising up through the atrium. Myra and Hebbing are
	visible in an elevator coming up to a high floor. It stops
	and they exit, moving down the corridor.
	
	                    MYRA (V.O.)
	          When the oil money was good, they
	          put up all these office buildings,
	          and now they're half empty.
	
	INT. OFFICE - DAY
	
	ECU, translucent glass in door with company name: COE, STARK,
	FELLOWES & ASSOCIATES, STOCK BROKERAGE - London - New York -
	Dallas - Los Angeles - Tokyo. CAMERA PANS to follow Myra and
	Hebbing as they enter the office.
	
	AN ANGLE showing the well-furnished outer office, the
	attractive and competent RECEPTIONIST welcoming Myra as
	someone she knows, gesturing her through, Myra graciously
	accepting, moving on. Hebbing's impressed by everything,
	trying not to show it.
	
	                    MYRA  (V.O.)
	          They'll give you anything to move
	          in; first two months free,
	          redecoration, whatever you want.
	
	AN ANGLE in a clerical office, four CLERKS at well-equipped
	desks with computer terminals, hard at work.
	Maps and clocks on the walls indicate the world. Myra and
	Hebbing pass through.
	
	                    MYRA (V.O.)
	          They help you set up the store!
	
	AN ANGLE in the PRIVATE SECRETARY'S office, she on the phone,
	nodding and smiling at Myra and waving her through. Myra
	leads the way, opening a door marked HENRY FELLOWES, Partner.
	
	                    MYRA (V.O.)
	          I'm the roper, I go out and find
	          them and bring them in. Cole ran
	          the store, and he was the best.
	
	INT. COLE'S OFFICE - DAY
	
	Myra and Hebbing enter an office decorated with sleekly
	understated opulence; the view through large windows is of
	apparently-prosperous skyscrapers. Cole, a plausible rich
	businessman, happily greets Myra.
	
	                    COLE 
	          Mary Beth! As beautiful as ever.
	
	He lifts a dubious eyebrow toward Hebbing.
	
	                    COLE
	              (gentle disapproval)
	          I see you brought a friend.
	
	As Mary Beth, Myra has a faint southern-belle accent and a
	clinging flirtatiousness.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Mister Hebbing is my bodyguard, my
	          strong right arm. Gloucester
	          Hebbing, may I present my fine
	          stockbroker, Henry Fellowes.
	
	The men shake hands, Hebbing open and pleased and dignified,
	Cole clearly holding something back.
	
	                    COLE 
	              (to Myra; gentle warning) 
	          Mary Beth, what we have here, uh...
	
	                    MYRA
	              (gaily innocent)
	          Oh, I told Mister Hebbing all about
	          it, how brilliant you are at making
	          money for your special clients!
	
	                    COLE
	              (alarmed)
	          Mary Beth, I hope you aren't
	          spreading this good news too
	          widely.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Well, of course not! I know how
	          dangerous this is. But I would
	          trust Mister Hebbing with anything.
	              (to Hebbing; suggestive)
	          Wouldn't I, darling?
	
	While Hebbing looks manly and flustered and pleased, Cole
	brings from under his desk a partially full gray canvas sack
	marked Federal Reserve Bank.
	
	                    COLE 
	          Well, I'll have to take your word
	          for it, Mary Beth. Here's your
	          money.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (innocent avarice)
	          Goody!
	
	Myra opens her attache case on the desk. Cole takes banded
	stacks of bills from the sack, packs them neatly in the case.
	Hebbing tries not to look envious and impressed.
	
	HEBBING'S POV: The top bill in each stack is a hundred.
	
	PREVIOUS SHOT. Myra takes a stack, riffles it for Hebbing's
	benefit.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Isn't that just beautiful?
	
	                    HEBBING 
	          Yes, it is.
	
	Myra returns the stack to the case, talks to Cole.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Henry, next time, couldn't Mister
	          Hebbing --
	
	                    COLE
	              (shocked)
	          Mary Beth! This has never been
	          anything but --
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Oh, I know, I know, and you've been
	          wonderful since I was widowed. But
	          Mister Hebbing has--
	              (to Hebbing)
	          -- you don't mind my telling him,
	          darling --
	              (to Cole)
	          -- suffered reverses. If he
	          could...
	
	She gestures vaguely, unable to describe the situation
	accurately. Hebbing fills in, bluff and hearty.
	
	                    HEBBING 
	          Top up the tanks, as It were. Until
	          this little glitch in the oil
	          economy comes to an end.
	              (man to man laugh)
	          Not that I understand exactly what
	          you do, not from Mary Beth's
	          explanation.
	
	Cole broods, studying Hebbing, deciding at last to trust him.
	
	                    COLE
	          Well. If Mary Beth vouches for you,
	          and if she told you the story
	          already...
	
	                    MYRA
	              (girlish laugh)
	          So here we are!
	
	                    COLE
	              (solemn)
	          Mister Hebbing, we are talking
	          about breaking the law here, I want
	          to be sure you understand that. No
	          one gets hurt, but the law does get
	          broken.
	
	                    HEBBING
	              (a real sport; laughing)
	          Well, that's what the law's for,
	          isn't it?
	
	                    COLE
	              (still serious)
	          And I don't just mean the SEC. We
	          could have the FBI breathing down
	          our necks.
	
	                    HEBBING
	              (suddenly serious)
	          I certainly hope not.
	
	                    COLE 
	          Loose talk is the one thing I worry
	          about.
	
	                    HEBBING
	          I can keep my mouth shut, Mister
	          Fellowes.
	
	Describing the scheme, Cole becomes increasingly
	enthusiastic.
	
	                    COLE 
	          Okay, then. Sit down, sit down.
	
	Hebbing sits on the sofa, Myra beside him, holding his arm in
	both of hers. Cole paces, describing.
	
	                    COLE 
	          The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours
	          ahead of us, New York one hour
	          behind. There isn't one hour of the
	          day when both are open. Information
	          moves, but it has to wait. Now, we
	          have a young fellow working here --
	          Do you know what a hacker is,
	          Mister Hebbing?
	
	                    HEBBING
	          One of those computer geniuses,
	          isn't it?
	
	                    COLE
	          You're right! And this boy tapped
	          into that main link between Tokyo
	          and the New York Stock Exchange. He
	          can give us, when it's really
	          useful, a seven second delay in
	          that movement of information. Do
	          you know what that means?
	
	Hebbing doesn't want to admit ignorance.
	
	                    HEBBING 
	          Well, you've got your information
	          ahead of New York, I see that.
	
	                    COLE 
	          Every once in a while, a major
	          change comes through.
	          We have seven seconds to take
	          advantage, put our buy order, our
	          sell order, into the computer in
	          New York before the Tokyo data
	          comes in.
	
	                    HEBBING 
	          Not much time.
	
	                    COLE 
	          We have to be ready. We have to
	          have the money, and we have to know
	          what the information means, and we
	          have to move immediately.
	
	                    HEBBING 
	              (impressed)
	          Seven seconds. I don't see how you
	          do it.
	
	                    COLE 
	          These machines -- They're in here.
	
	Cole crosses to an inner door, pushes it partway open, looks
	back grinning with his hand on the knob.
	
	                    COLE 
	          Want a look?
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.
	
	INT. BARE ROOM - DAY
	
	A bare dusty room. A ladder leans against a wall, a paint can
	on the floor beside it. Only Cole is visible in the open
	doorway. He speaks back into the main office.
	
	                    COLE 
	          Come take a look. An entire-suite
	          of main-frame computer.
	
	                    MYRA (O.S.)
	          We're not really interested, Henry.
	
	INT. COLE'S OFFICE - DAY
	
	Cole remains in the doorway, luring Hebbing with a smile.
	
	                    COLE 
	          It's quite a sight. You sure?
	
	Cole's pushing this too far. Hebbing's thinking politeness
	requires him to look. Myra's nervous, her smile with an edge
	to it.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Henry, don't try Mister Hebbing's
	          patience. He knows what machines
	          look like.
	
	INT. BARE ROOM - DAY
	
	Cole smiles at the empty room again, looks back.
	
	                    COLE 
	          Well, if you're sure.
	
	He shuts the door.
	
	                    ROY (V.O.) 
	          Cole liked to take risks, huh?
	
	EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
	
	Roy and Myra at the table.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          He didn't think they were risks. He
	          was so good, Roy, he could just
	          play with the mark.
	
	                    ROY 
	          And when he got serious?
	
	                    MYRA 
	          He'd explain he had to have cash,
	          so there wouldn't be any paper
	          trail for the SEC. And a lot of
	          cash, or it wasn't worth while. The
	          least we ever took was forty
	          thousand, and the most was one
	          hundred eighty-five thousand
	          dollars! From one sucker!
	
	                    ROY 
	          I thought these people were broke.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They
	          had savings accounts, stocks to
	          sell, houses to mortgage. Sell
	          their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had
	          a lot of money, when they put their
	          minds to it.
	          Or when I put their minds to it. I
	          stayed with them, that's the
	          roper's job, made them get up every
	          penny they could raise, turn it all
	          over to Cole.
	
	                    ROY 
	          And a month later, the sucker calls
	          the cops and you're on the run.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          No no! He never calls the cops, not
	          after we give him the blow-off.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Yeah? How?
	
	INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
	
	Myra puts a blood-filled four-inch-square plastic package
	into her bra on the left side, then puts on a white blouse.
	
	                    MYRA  (V.O.)
	          Three or four days after Cole got
	          the money, he'd phone the sucker,
	          tell him he'd made the move.
	
	EXT. NEW BUILDING - DAY
	
	Myra and Hebbing hurry across the sidewalk from the limo,
	each carrying an attache case.
	
	                    MYRA (V.O.)
	          Our buy was in the computer, we
	          were rich, he should come collect.
	
	INT. COLE'S OFFICE - DAY
	
	Myra and Hebbing enter, Cole meets them, all happy.
	
	                    COLE 
	          Here you are! Two rich people!
	
	                    HEBBING
	          I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I
	          had moments I was worried.
	
	                    COLE
	          You brought a case? Good.
	
	Cole brings out the canvas sack from under the desk, reaches
	in, brings out a stack of bills. The door opens and two men
	in suits and topcoats and hats enter, one of them flashing a
	badge. (These are, altered, two of the clerks from before.)
	
	                    MAN
	          Hold it right there!
	
	                    COLE
	              (cool outrage)
	          What? This is a private office!
	
	                    MAN
	          FBI! Stock fraud, tampering with
	          Exchange communications --
	
	Cole suddenly loses all control, becomes a gibbering wreck.
	
	                    COLE
	          Oh, my God! No! The scandal!
	
	The second man approaches Hebbing, pencil and notebook at the
	ready, manner cold and tough.
	
	                    SECOND MAN
	          Your name?
	
	                    HEBBING
	          My --? I don't I only --
	
	                    COLE
	              (screams at Myra)
	          You! You and your goddamn big
	          mouth!
	
	                    KYRA
	              (terrified)
	          Henry, no, I --
	
	                    COLE
	          Who did you tell? Who?
	
	                    MYRA
	          Just one or two of the girls, just,
	          they wouldn't --
	
	Cole pulls a pistol from his desk drawer.
	
	                    COLE 
	          Don't move!
	
	                    MAN
	          Mister Fellowes, that isn't going
	          to do you any good. Put that down,
	          and --
	
	Cole ignores him, staring in frantic hatred at Myra.
	
	                    COLE 
	          You ruined me! You destroyed me!
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Henry, no!
	
	Cole shoots her, the SOUND very loud, the men flinching away.
	Myra slaps her hand to her breast; blood spurts between her
	fingers. In terror, she turns toward Hebbing, who stares at
	the blood seeping down her white blouse. She tries to speak,
	can't. She reaches out, her bloody hand sliding down
	Hebbing's front without getting any purchase, leaving a swath
	of blood diagonally across his jacket, shirt and tie. She
	topples forward. Hebbing tries to hold her, but she slips to
	the floor.
	
	Cole runs around the desk toward the door, waving the gun.
	
	                    COLE 
	          Get back! Get back!
	
	The men warily move away from the door.
	
	                    COLE 
	          I'll kill the first one that
	          follows me!
	
	Cole runs from the room. The two men pull guns from hip
	holsters under their coat-tails. Hebbing, kneeling beside
	Myra, watches them approach the door, crouch, run through.
	Hebbing rises, looks around, runs to the inner door, finds it
	locked. He crosses to the main door, looks out, cautiously
	creeps from the room.
	
	Myra sits up.
	
	INT. OFFICE - DAY
	
	Hebbing hurries through the empty secretary's office and out
	the other door. The two men enter from a different door and
	cross to re-enter Cole's office.
	
	INT. ATRIUM - DAY
	
	Cole stands behind a pillar, watching. Across the way,
	Hebbing comes out of the office, staring around, trying to
	wipe the blood from his clothes. In obvious panic, he runs to
	the elevator, presses the button.
	
	AN ANGLE through the glass wall into the elevator as it
	stops. The doors open, Hebbing hurries in, frantically jabs
	the button. The elevator descends. CAMERA PANS to Cole coming
	around the corridor, entering the office.
	
	INT. COLE'S OFFICE - DAY
	
	General hilarity. The secretary, two men, other two clerks,
	chauffeur and receptionist are all present, opening
	champagne, Hebbing's money now out of the sack and spread on
	the desk. Myra, stripped to the waist (unconcerned about the
	others present) cleans blood from her breasts with damp
	towels. He and Myra look at one another across the room,
	broadly smile.
	
	EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
	
	Myra's very up, from reliving this story.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Oh, Roy, it was great! We were
	          rolling in dough, lived wherever we
	          wanted, only pulled two or three
	          scams a year.
	
	                    ROY 
	          What happened to Cole?
	
	                    MYRA
	              (suddenly evasive)
	          He retired.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Where?
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Upstate.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Upstate where?
	
	                    MYRA
	          Atascadero.
	
	                    ROY 
	          That's where they keep the
	          criminally insane, isn't it?
	
	Myra turns her face away.
	
	INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
	
	Expensive room. Cole, naked, expression haunted and crazed,
	sits cross-legged on the bed. Myra enters, happy, carrying
	dress shop boxes. She stops, shocked, when she sees Cole.
	
	                    MYRA
	          No, baby. Not again.
	
	He stares at the floor over the edge of the bed, like a
	shipwreck victim in a raft looking at the sea.
	
	                    COLE
	          It's hollow. You'll fall through.
	
	Myra drops the packages on a chair.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?
	
	                    COLE 
	              (frightened but
	               determined)
	          Can't move.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          It's just the strain again, the
	          stress. We'll take a vacation.
	
	                    COLE
	          It's all hollow. Nothing behind it.
	
	She approaches him, scared but needing him.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Cole, you scare me when this
	          happens. One of these times...
	
	She touches him. He suddenly lashes out, knocking her
	backward, glaring at her.
	
	                    COLE 
	          Demon! Demon! That's why you can
	          walk on it! Demon!
	
	                    MYRA
	              (heartbroken)
	          Oh, Cole, please. Please come out
	          of it. What would I do without you?
	
	Distracted, gone, unaware of her existence, he gazes around,
	hugs himself, sits staring at demons. She watches him,
	mournful, knowing he's gone.
	
	EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
	
	Myra looks back at Roy. Her expression makes it clear she
	isn't going to tell him any more than she already has.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          He retired, and that's it. But I
	          didn't. I'm still the best long-con
	          roper you'll ever see.
	
	Roy laughs, genuinely pleased by her and also tacitly letting
	his questions drop.
	
	                    ROY 
	          I just bet you are, too. And now
	          you're trying to rope me.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (pushing enthusiasm)
	          Join up with you! I watched you,
	          Roy, I've been watching you,
	          wondering if I should talk about
	          this at all, or maybe just...
	              (shrug)
	
	                    ROY 
	          Take a hike, you mean?
	
	                    MYRA 
	          I need a partner, Roy. I need an
	          inside man, and you're it. You
	          could be as wonderful as Cole.
	
	                    ROY 
	              (dubious)
	          I don't know, Myra, I never had
	          partners. I never needed them.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Not to take soldiers for a hundred
	          bucks. But how about taking a bank
	          president for a hundred grand?
	
	Roy doesn't like this; he's feeling pressured. Myra sees it,
	but believes she's got him anyway, so she can let up. She
	pats his hand.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Think about it. Okay?
	
	                    ROY
	              (easy to promise)
	          Sure.
	
	INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
	
	A little drunk and happy, Roy and Myra come down the corridor
	together, then make it obvious they're going into separate
	rooms, across the corridor from one another.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (coy, sexy)
	          See you later.
	
	Roy complains, but half-heartedly, half humorously; this
	argument has already taken place.
	
	                    ROY 
	          I still don't see why we have to
	          have separate rooms. You expect
	          your father to come through?
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Separate bathrooms, darling. I will
	          not lay out all my cosmetics for
	          you to knock over.
	
	                    ROY
	              (nevertheless grumpy)
	          Things a man isn't supposed to
	          know.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (soothing)
	          You don't mind, really, do you,
	          Roy? It's been such a wonderful
	          evening, I guess I just wore myself
	          out.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Sure. I'm pretty tired myself.
	
	They unlock the opposing doors, look back at one another.
	Myra's smile and good-night wave are consciously cute. Roy's
	response is a little forced. They go into their rooms.
	
	INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Once he's alone, Roy stops trying to look like a good sport.
	Disgusted, he tosses the room key onto the dresser, then
	crosses to sliding glass doors closed in front of a balcony.
	He's about to close the drapes when he looks out, changes his
	mind, unlocks and opens the door. He steps outside.
	
	EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT
	
	A high floor, with a wide view of ocean and starry sky. Roy
	leans on the rail, looking out, thinking. He mutters to
	himself.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Long con. I'm the one's been
	          conned. Who needs this?
	
	He continues to stand there, taking some solace from the
	night. BEAT. Phone RINGS. Confused, irritated, he turns to
	look into the room. Phone RINGS. At last, he goes back into
	the room.
	
	INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Roy crosses to pick up the phone, grumpy and suspicious.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Yeah?
	
	                    MYRA (V.O.)
	              (filtered)
	          Open your door.
	
	                    ROY 
	          What?
	              (grins; gets it)
	          What for?
	
	                    MYRA (V.O.) 
	              (filtered)
	          Open it and find out.
	
	Roy hangs up and crosses to the door.
	
	AN ANGLE directly at the door as Roy opens it, showing Myra's
	door open across the way, Myra standing in her doorway naked.
	She waves at him to move over.
	
	                    MYRA (CONT'D)
	          Gangway!
	
	Roy steps back, holding his door open.
	
	INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
	
	AN ANGLE down the hall as Myra skips across from her room to
	Roy's, her door slamming behind her.
	
	INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Myra runs in, giggling. Roy shuts the door, laughing at her.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (coquettish)
	          I hope you don't mind, sir. I just
	          washed my clothes, and I couldn't
	          do a thing with them.
	
	Roy's pleased, but at a loss.
	
	                    ROY 
	          You -- I don't know.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (sudden burst of laughter)
	               )
	          If you could have seen your face
	          when I told you good night! You
	          looked so, so... Ah!
	
	                    ROY 
	          Oh, come here.
	
	They embrace.
	
	INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
	
	A clean anonymous Holiday Inn. Lilly, dressed for the track,
	sits at the round table under the swag light, sorting through
	her business purse. There's a folded newspaper on the table.
	KNOCK on the door. She's startled. For just a second, she's
	like a trapped animal. Then she's calm again. She turns the
	purse around, opens another zipper section, removes a pistol
	and a silencer, quickly screws the silencer onto the pistol,
	lays the pistol on the table and covers it with the
	newspaper. Then she crosses to open the door.
	
	AN ANGLE to include Roy in the doorway, grinning, easy.
	Lilly's surprised, pleased, but wary.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Roy! What are you doing in San
	          Diego?
	
	                    ROY
	              (entering)
	          Myra and me come down to LaJolla
	          for the weekend.
	
	Lilly makes a face, but no comment, at Myra's name, as she
	closes the door.
	
	                    LILLY
	          If you come out to the track, don't
	          know me.
	
	                    ROY
	          We won't hit the track. The beach.
	          Couple a nice restaurants.
	
	He takes from his pockets the wads of money held removed from
	the clown pictures, extends them toward her.
	
	                    LILLY
	          What's that?
	
	                    ROY
	          Four grand. For the hospital. Is
	          that enough?
	
	                    LILLY
	              (distressed)
	          Roy, I don't want money from you.
	
	                    ROY
	          I pay my debts.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (level skeptical look)
	          You do?
	
	Since she won't take the money, he turns to put it on the
	table beside her purse, pushing the newspaper out of the way,
	revealing the gun. He gives it a surprised smile.
	
	                    ROY
	          Expecting visitors?
	
	                    LILLY
	          No. That was the point.
	
	She crosses to unscrew the silencer and put both pieces back
	in her purse. Roy, watching, points at the still angry burn
	on her hand.
	
	                    ROY 
	          You ought to put a bandage on that.
	
	                    LILLY
	          No can do. Have to dip in and out
	          of my bag too much. Besides, it'll
	          heal in the air.
	
	Disdainful and hurt, she pushes at the wads of money.
	
	                    LILLY (CONT'D)
	          Roy, take that back.
	
	His own hostility shows through.
	
	                    ROY 
	          No.
	
	She's not used to being vulnerable, can neither hide it nor
	really express it; can't use it as a tactic.
	
	                    LILLY
	          I thought... I was hoping we could
	          play it straight with one another.
	
	                    ROY 
	          I guess not. You'll be heading east
	          from here, huh?
	
	                    LILLY 
	              (dull)
	          After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Well... nice to see you again,
	          Lilly.
	
	                    LILLY
	          You, too, Roy.
	
	Roy finds this parting unsatisfactory, but has nothing to
	add. With a shrug, he leaves. Lilly looks after him, her
	expression becoming resentful, dully angry.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Prick.
	
	EXT. HOLIDAY INN - DAY
	
	Myra sits in the back seat of a taxi parked across the street
	from the motel. The door to Lilly's room is visible in b.g.
	Roy walks toward the street from Lilly's room.
	
	                    DRIVER
	          Here he comes.
	
	                    MYRA
	          I see him.
	
	Reaching the sidewalk, Roy turns to an empty cab parked on
	that side of the street, in front of the motel. Myra's driver
	shifts into gear.
	
	                    MYRA (CONT'D)
	          Wait. Hold it.
	
	                    DRIVER
	          That's the guy we're following.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Just wait.
	
	Roy enters the other cab, which drives away, as Lilly comes
	out of her room in b.g.
	
	                    MYRA (CONT'D)
	          Ah.
	
	Lilly gets into her Chrysler, backs away from the slot,
	drives to the street.
	
	                    MYRA (CONT'D)
	          Now we follow her.
	
	                    DRIVER
	          You're the boss.
	
	AN ANGLE on the two vehicles, as they leave the motel.
	
	EXT. DELMAR - DAY
	
	Where the surf meets the turf. Over the punters' heads, out
	beyond the track, spreads the Pacific Ocean, unnoticed,
	ignored. In every shot in this sequence, the ocean is visible
	but not looked at.
	
	AN ANGLE on Lilly, with her heavy shoulderbag, moving along
	empty tables, here and there picking up used tickets.
	
	AN ANGLE on Myra, on a different level, watching Lilly.
	
	AN ANGLE on Lilly at the betting windows.
	
	AN ANGLE on Myra, on a high vantage point in the stands. A
	MAN near her watches the field through binoculars. Myra ASKS
	if she can borrow them for a minute. Men are always happy to
	do Myra favors; the man gives her the binoculars. She looks
	at the field briefly, then turns and looks through the
	binoculars the other way, outside the track. The man,
	surprised, looks the same way.
	
	MAN'S POV: The parking area.
	
	PREVIOUS SHOT. The man looks in curiosity at Myra, who
	concentrates, adjusting the focus.
	
	MYRA'S POV: Foreshortened through the binoculars, Lilly opens
	the Chrysler's trunk, stashes money.
	
	PREVIOUS SHOT. Myra smiles, turns it into a sweet thank-you
	smile as she returns the binoculars to their owner.
	
	EXT. HOTEL POOL - DAY
	
	Roy dives into the pool, swims underwater to the ladder,
	climbs out near a YOUNG BLONDE on a chaise longue, who's been
	admiring him.
	
	                    BLONDE
	          You stay down real good.
	
	                    ROY
	          One of my talents.
	
	                    BLONDE 
	              (pointing upward)
	          Your mother's calling.
	
	Roy looks up.
	
	AN ANGLE to show Myra waving from her balcony, four flights
	up.
	
	PREVIOUS SHOT. Roy's at first surprised, then amused by the
	blonde.
	
	                    ROY
	          Naughty.
	
	He gathers up his towel and heads for the building.
	
	INT. BATHROOM - DAY
	
	Roy stands in heavy spray in the shower, half asleep, gently
	touching his stomach where the bruise used to be. KNOCK on
	door. He ignores it.
	
	                    MYRA (O.S.)
	          Roy! You drown in there?
	
	He rouses himself.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Be right out!
	
	INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
	
	Myra moves away from the bathroom door. She's in a bad mood.
	She paces back and forth, out onto the balcony, then back
	into the room as Roy comes out of the bathroom wearing a
	towel.
	
	                    ROY
	          You were gone for a while.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (casual)
	          I went out to Delmar.
	
	                    ROY
	              (suddenly wary) )
	          The track? Did you run into Lilly?
	
	                    MYRA 
	          I saw her.
	
	                    ROY
	          She didn't see you, in other words.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          I'm not trying to make trouble,
	          Roy. It's just, she's always so
	          nasty to me, I thought, who is she
	          to be so high and mighty. I saw her
	          out there, and I called a friend of
	          mine in Baltimore, so now I know
	          who she is.
	
	                    ROY
	              (dry)
	          You must have some very
	          knowledgeable friends.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          I'm well connected, Roy, Cole
	          introduced me to a lot of people.
	          Very valuable. Valuable for us.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Running your broker scam, you mean.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (enthusiastic)
	          You and me, Roy. What a team we'll
	          make. We think alike; we get along
	          together.
	          Once or twice a year we take some
	          slob, the rest of the time we live
	          like this. You won't regret this,
	          Roy.
	
	                    ROY
	          Regret what? I didn't say I was
	          coming aboard.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          But why not? I thought it was
	          settled. What's holding you back?
	
	                    ROY 
	          Come on, Myra, don't talk business
	          here. This is time out.
	
	She considers him.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          You mean, it would be too tough to
	          give me a turndown here. Easier on
	          home grounds.
	
	                    ROY
	              (shrug)
	          Yes or no. They're both easier at
	          home. Okay?
	
	Myra makes a visible effort to be accommodating.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Whatever you say, darling.
	
	INT. KAGGS' OFFICE - DAY
	
	Kaggs sits at his computer terminal, bringing up data, not
	pleased by what he sees. Buzzer SOUNDS. He swivels to the
	desk, presses the intercom button.
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          Yeah?
	
	                    RECEPTIONIST (V.O.)
	          Roy Dillon, Mr. Kaggs.
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          Good! Send him in.
	
	With a now-we're-getting-somewhere manner, Kaggs turns back
	to the VDT, punches up a different set of data, sits looking
	at it in gloomy satisfaction. Roy enters, and Kaggs rises,
	extending his hand across the desk. They shake hands.
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          Good to have you back, Roy. I was
	          just looking at --
	
	                    ROY 
	          Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.
	
	                    KAGGS 
	              (keen)
	          You're turning me down? Makes no
	          sense, Roy.
	
	                    ROY 
	          I guess I'm just not a leader of
	          men.
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          Oh, come on, Roy.
	
	                    ROY 
	          The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          Perk, remember?
	
	                    ROY 
	          Okay, fine. Perk, the truth is, I
	          like things the way they are now.
	          Pick my own hours, have time for,
	          uh, other activities...
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          A well-rounded life. I respect
	          that. But it has to have a center,
	          Roy, something you care about,
	          something you can think about.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Maybe I'm just not ready for that
	          yet.
	
	                    KAGGS
	              (deep sigh)
	          Well, Roy, if that's the way you
	          feel, I won't badger you.
	              (forced laugh)
	          Don't want to lose you as a
	          salesman, too.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Oh, I'd like to stay on. Just keep
	          everything the way it was.
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          That's what we'll do, then. But I
	          tell you what, Roy. Before I hire
	          anybody else, I'll ask you one last
	          time. Fair enough?
	
	                    ROY 
	          Fair enough.
	
	They shake hands.
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
	
	Roy's room. He has one of the clown pictures face down on the
	coffee table. He takes money from his jacket pockets, crams
	it into the space, which is now just about full. As he's
	tightening the wing nuts closing the back, doorbell RINGS. He
	hurries, finishing the job, hanging the picture on the wall,
	then crossing to open the door. Myra enters, ebullient.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Darling, guess what? I had to tell
	          you right away.
	
	She gives him an enthusiastic kiss, then marches into the
	living room.
	
	                    ROY 
	              (grinning)
	          And hello to you, too.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          I called a fellow I know in Tulsa,
	          the one who plays my chauffeur.
	          There's a sucker there he says is
	          made for us. And a boroker that
	          just shut down, we can use their
	          office, not change a thing! Now, I
	          can scrape up ten grand without
	          much trouble. That leaves fifteen
	          or twenty for your end. We could
	          start this weekend, get the sucker
	          into position --
	
	                    ROY 
	          Wait a minute! When did this
	          happen, that we're partners?
	
	                    MYRA 
	              (bewildered)
	          What?
	
	                    ROY 
	          The last I looked, we were just
	          talking things over.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          But the setup's there. It's there
	          now.
	
	                    ROY 
	          I don't think I need it.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          You're too good for the small-time,
	          Roy. Move up to where there's big
	          dough to be made, and you don't
	          have to stick your neck out every
	          day.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Maybe I like it where I am.
	
	Myra's need breaks through her good sense.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Well, maybe I don't! I had ten good
	          years with Cole, and I want them
	          back! I gotta have a partner! I
	          looked and I looked and believe me,
	          brother, I kissed a lot of fucking
	          frogs, and you're my prince!
	
	Roy tries to treat this lightly.
	
	                    ROY
	          Don't I get any say in this?
	
	                    MYRA 
	          No! Because I --
	
	                    ROY
	              (pointing at her)
	          That's what I say.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (thrown off course)
	          What?
	
	                    ROY 
	          What I say is, no. We don't do
	          partners.
	
	                    MYRA (CONT'D)
	              (raging)
	          For Christ's sake, why not?
	
	                    ROY 
	          Mostly, because you scare the shit
	          out of me. I've seen people like
	          you before, baby. Double-tough and
	          sharp as they come, and you get
	          what you want or else. But you
	          don't make it work forever.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Bullshit!
	
	                    ROY 
	          No; history. Sooner or later, the
	          lightning hits. I don't want to be
	          around when it hits you.
	
	She stares at him, trying to find a chink in the armor,
	trying to find a reason, trying to find something.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          What is it? What's going on?
	
	                    ROY 
	          I'm happy the way I am.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          By God, it's your mother. It's
	          Lilly.
	
	                    ROY
	              (doesn't get it) )
	          What?
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Sure it is. That's why you act so
	          funny around each other.
	
	He frowns at her, not believing he understands her right.
	
	                    ROY 
	          What's that?
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Don't act so goddamned innocent!
	          You and your own mother, gah! You
	          like to go back where you been,
	          huh?
	
	He takes a step toward her, rising toward fury.
	
	                    ROY 
	          You watch that mouth.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          I'm wise to you, I should have seen
	          it before, you rotten son of a
	          bitch. How is it, huh? How do you
	          like --
	
	He slaps her openhanded but hard, and she staggers back. He
	pursues her.
	
	                    ROY 
	          How do you like this?
	
	He slaps her as hard with the other hand. Astonished,
	frightened, befuddled, she backpedals, bringing her forearms
	up to protect her face. He grabs her two wrists in one hand,
	holds them out of the way, slaps her forehand and backhand,
	forehand and backhand.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          STOP!!
	
	He suddenly gets control of himself, releases her, steps back
	into the middle of the room. He's angry, but also remorseful,
	sorry he lost control but still enraged at the enormity of
	her suggestion.
	
	                    ROY 
	          That's not like me. I don't do
	          violence.
	
	She cowers against the wall, peering in terror at him through
	her raised arms. He settles down, becomes heavily calm.
	
	                    ROY 
	          That's why we wouldn't work
	          together. You're disgusting. Your
	          mind's so filthy, it's hard even to
	          look at you.
	
	He crosses to the apartment door, pulls it open. Sunlight
	pours in.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Goodbye, Myra.
	
	She lowers her arms slowly, as though her whole body aches.
	She's still scared, but angry now, too. She'd like to tell
	him off, but discretion tells her not to. She moves across
	the room toward the open door, but stops, not wanting to be
	that close to him.
	Understanding, he backs away from the doorway, gestures with
	cold irony for her to proceed. She moves to the threshold,
	looks back at him.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          And you don't even know it.
	
	Angry again, Roy steps forward. She hastily steps outside,
	and he slams the door.
	
	EXT. ROY'S APARTMENT - DAY
	
	Myra moves slowly along the balcony, muttering to herself.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Mama. It's Mama. She's the one.
	
	She stops, holding the balcony rail, looking out at the city.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          You'll get yours, Mama. Oh, yes.
	
	INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
	
	Lilly's room; empty. Phone RINGS. Lilly enters, tired, with
	her shoulderbag; the end of her work day. Phone RINGS. She
	frowns at it, expecting nothing good, then drops the
	shoulderbag on the bed, crosses, answers.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Yes?
	
	A sudden smile doesn't entirely hide the wariness.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Roy! An unexpected pleasure.
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
	
	Roy, troubled, paces while talking on the phone.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Lilly, I've got a couple things to
	          think about. Well, kind of job
	          offers, kind of. Different ways to
	          go. I'd kind of like to talk them
	          out, you know? Maybe just hear
	          myself talk.
	
	INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
	
	Lilly's delighted, but can't trust this moment more than any
	other.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Well, sure, Roy. You want me to
	          drive up --? Okay, fine, come on
	          down.
	              (kidding)
	          It won't be a home-cooked meal, you
	          know.
	
	TNT. LIVING ROOM DAY
	
	                    ROY
	              (kidding)
	          Well, that's good news.
	
	He hangs up, but he's nervous, still uncertain, pacing.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Well? Who's a boy gonna talk to, if
	          not his mother?
	
	The sound of the question makes him laugh.
	
	EXT. MOTEL - DAY
	
	Myra's Cadillac eases to a stop across the street, where she
	earlier waited in the cab.
	
	AN ANGLE through the windshield at Myra, settling down to
	wait, looking at the motel.
	
	INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Lilly comes out of the bathroom, putting her lipstick away in
	a small purse. She's dressed carefully for tonight; upscale
	and respectable, without being stodgy. She crosses to the
	window -- night view outside -- and as she pulls the drapes
	shut the phone RINGS. She looks at it in disappointment,
	crosses to answer.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (expecting rejection)
	          Roy?
	
	INT. OFFICE - NIGHT
	
	Irv the accountant's office in Baltimore. He looks secretive
	and scared, talks in a hush.
	
	                    IRV 
	          Lilly, listen, it's Irv. You were
	          always decent with me, I'm taking a
	          hell of a chance here.
	          Somebody blew you out with Bobo.
	          The car full of money. He's --
	          Lilly?
	
	INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Empty. The phone receiver dangles off the table on its cord.
	The door finishes closing.
	
	EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT
	
	Lilly's Chrysler jounces out to the street, moving too fast,
	making the turn, racing away. CAMERA PANS to Myra's Cadillac,
	pulling away from the curb, following. CAMERA HOLDS with the
	two cars receding in b.g.
	
	INT. HONDA - NIGHT 
	
	Roy drives down a San Diego street, is stopped by a red
	light, looks at his watch. He's late.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Damn.
	
	INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Empty; as before. The door opens and the two thugs we saw
	earlier with Bobo enter, one putting a thick ring of keys
	away in his jacket pocket. They close the door, look around
	the room. One goes to the closet, opens it, looks at the
	clothing inside, while the other goes into the bathroom. The
	first crosses to the dresser, pulls open a drawer full of
	clothing. The second comes out of the bathroom. They look at
	one another. The guy from the bathroom shakes his head. The
	other one points at the dangling phone, speaks.
	
	                    THUG
	          Somebody spooked her.
	
	                    SECOND THUG
	          White Chrysler.

	          Full of cash.
	
	They leave the room.
	
	EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT
	
	Roy walks toward Lilly's room as the two thugs pass him, on
	their way out. Roy knocks on Lilly's door, waits, knocks
	again.
	He tries to look through a crack in the drapes into the room,
	then turns to look at the empty place where Lilly's Chrysler
	had been. He shakes his head, knocks once more, looks at his
	watch, turns away.
	
	                    ROY
	              (disgusted)
	          Thanks a lot, Lilly.
	
	He walks off.
	
	EXT. ARIZONA MOTEL - NIGHT
	
	Lilly's white Chrysler pulls off the road into the front
	parking area of a new small motel. The car brakes to a stop.
	
	AN ANGLE from the road as Myra's blue Cadillac drives slowly
	by, while, in b.g., Lilly gets out of the Chrysler, moving as
	though she's stiff and tired. Lilly enters the motel office.
	
	INT. MOTEL OFFICE - NIGHT
	
	The CLERK, an elderly woman, turns away from a small TV set
	when Lilly enters.
	
	                    CLERK
	          Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Good evening. I'd like a single for
	          tonight.
	
	                    CLERK 
	          Oh, everything's the same size,
	          same price.
	
	The clerk extends a registration card and pen to Lilly, who
	takes them but doesn't yet start to write.
	
	                    LILLY
	          I'm a very light sleeper, traffic
	          noise keeps me wide awake all
	          night.
	
	                    CLERK
	              (sympathetic)
	          Those trucks. I know exactly what
	          you mean.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Do you have something around back,
	          facing away from the road?
	
	The clerk turns to consider the key rack.
	
	                    CLERK
	          I'll put you in one thirty-one.
	          Very quiet. Faces the desert.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Sounds perfect. I can park my car
	          back there?
	
	                    CLERK 
	          Right in front of the room.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Fine.
	
	She starts to fill in the registration card.
	
	                    LILLY
	          And I'll want to leave an early
	          wake-up call.
	
	                    CLERK 
	          No problem. My husband gets up the
	          crack of dawn.
	              (confidential)
	          It's his kidneys.
	
	EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
	
	Motel in b.g. The blue Cadillac, having turned around and
	come back, pulls off onto the shoulder of the road about
	fifty yards short of the motel.
	
	INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
	
	Over Myra's shoulder as she watches, through the windshield,
	the Chrysler parked in front of the motel. Lilly comes out of
	the office over there, gets into the Chrysler, backs it up,
	drives it out of sight past the motel. Myra puts the Cadillac
	in gear.
	
	INT. ROOM 131 - NIGHT
	
	A clean anonymous motel room, with two beds. Lilly enters,
	very weary, puts her shoulderbag on one of the beds, goes
	back outside and leaves the door open. She has backed the
	Chrysler into its spot just outside her room, so its trunk is
	visible through the open doorway.
	
	EXT. ARIZONA MOTEL - NIGHT
	
	AN ANGLE on Lilly as she opens the rear door of the Chrysler
	and leans in.
	
	INT. CHRYSLER - MIGHT
	
	Lilly wrestles the rear seat out of position, reaches down
	into the space under and behind it, and brings out a soft
	cloth overnight bag. It seems not too full but fairly heavy.
	She puts the bag on the ground outside the car and then
	pushes and prods the seat back into position.
	
	EXT. ARIZONA MOTEL - NIGHT
	
	Lilly shuts the car door, picks up the bag, and enters her
	room, shutting the door behind her.
	
	INT. MOTEL OFFICE - NIGHT
	
	Myra enters. The clerk looks at her in surprise.
	
	                    CLERK 
	          Something wrong?
	              (embarrassed)
	          I'm sorry. I thought you were the
	          other lady.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          No. I'm me.
	
	INT. ROOM 231 - NIGHT
	
	Lilly puts the bag on the bed with her shoulderbag. She opens
	the overnight bag, takes from it a blond wig, a pair of horn
	rim glasses and a passport. From her shoulderbag she takes
	the pistol and silencer. She attaches the silencer to the
	pistol and puts the pistol under the pillow of the other bed.
	
	INT. MOTEL OFFICE - NIGHT
	
	Myra's checking in. She fills in the registration card while
	the clerk considers her key rack.
	
	                    CLERK 
	          I'll give you one oh seven. That's
	          a very nice room, very handy, in
	          the front, right by the pool.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Oh, don't you have something around
	          back, where it's quieter?
	
	The clerk sighs, looks at the key she'd taken from the rack,
	reluctantly goes back to consider the situation again.
	
	                    CLERK 
	          Everybody wants the back tonight.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          I guess everybody wants privacy.
	
	INT. ROOM 131 - NIGHT
	
	Lilly, in nightgown, yawning, comes out of the bathroom,
	switching off its light. The shoulderbag and overnight bag
	and overnight bag's contents are still on one bed. Lilly gets
	into the other, switches off the light.
	
	INT. ROOM 119 - NIGHT
	
	Virtually identical to Room 131. Myra enters, lugging a
	suitcase, and shuts the door behind herself. She puts the
	suitcase on one of the beds, opens it, paws through it, and
	brings out slippers, nightgown and robe. Briskly, she strips
	and puts on the nightgown, the slippers and the robe.
	
	Back into the suitcase, she brings out a small snubnose
	pistol which she puts in the pocket of her robe. Next out of
	the suitcase is a large ring of keys.
	
	Sitting on the other bed, she compares her room key with keys
	on the ring, takes three keys from the ring, and puts them in
	her robe pocket along with the room key.
	
	Getting to her feet, she crosses to the dresser, picks up the
	ice bucket, and leaves the room, closing the door behind
	herself.
	
	EXT. ROOM 131 - NIGHT
	
	CU, the door, with its number. CAMERA PANS to pick up Myra,
	approaching. She stops at room 132, looks at the Chrysler,
	smiles at it in proprietary fashion, and pats the Chrysler on
	the trunk.
	
	Then she turns to the room. She takes the keys from her
	pocket, looks around to be sure she's alone, and bends over
	the lock.
	
	INT. ROOM 131 - NIGHT
	
	In very dim light, Myra enters the room, closes the door,
	moves toward the beds. CAMERA PANS with her. Keeping her eyes
	on the sleeping form of Lilly, she puts the empty ice bucket
	on the empty bed, then moves closer to Lilly. CAMERA PANS in,
	moving forward as Myra's arms move forward, moving to CU on
	Lilly as Myra's hands (remaining IN FRAME) move forward and
	down. Her hands abruptly clamp on Lilly's throat. QUICK CUT.
	
	EXT. PHOENIX AIRPORT - DAY
	
	ESTABLISHING SHOT. A plane lands.
	
	INT. PHOENIX AIRPORT - DAY
	
	Roy, looking stunned, is among the deplaning passengers
	spreading out across the terminal. He's met by PIERSON, a
	plainclothes detective, and a uniformed COP.
	
	                    PIERSON 
	          Roy Dillon?
	
	                    ROY 
	          Yes?
	
	                    PIERSON 
	          Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police.
	          I have a car here.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Thank you.
	
	INT. POLICE CAR - DAY
	
	The uniformed cop drives. Pierson and Roy sit in back.
	
	                    PIERSON 
	          I realize this is a shock.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
	
	                    PIERSON 
	          That's natural.
	
	                    ROY 
	          No. I mean, I don't believe it.
	          Lilly is not a suicide. I know my
	          mother, nothing would make her
	          check out.
	
	                    PIERSON 
	          I'm sorry, it was her all right.
	          Her gun, even.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Gun?
	
	                    PIERSON 
	          I grant you, it's a little odd,
	          shoot yourself with a gun with a
	          silencer on it, but it was hers,
	          all right. It really is your
	          mother, Mister Dillon.
	
	                    ROY 
	          It may be Lilly, but it isn't
	          suicide.
	
	                    PIERSON 
	              (interested)
	          Do you have any particular reason
	          to say that?
	
	                    ROY 
	          My mother... Well, I guess it
	          doesn't matter now. She worked for
	          gamblers. She always knew they
	          might turn on her some day.
	
	                    PIERSON
	              (thoughtful)
	          A hit, you mean. Honestly, it
	          doesn't have that feel to it, but
	          I'll certainly consider the
	          possibility. Thank you for telling
	          me.
	
	The car stops.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Not that it matters.
	              (looks out)
	          This is the morgue?
	
	                    PIERSON 
	          You up to it now?
	
	                    ROY 
	          Sure. Let's get it over.
	
	                    PIERSON 
	          One thing I have to caution you
	          about. A gunshot wound...
	
	                    ROY
	              (impatient)
	          Yes, I know, I know.
	
	                    PIERSON
	              (reluctant)
	          Well, uh, you know, she ate the
	          gun.
	
	                    ROY
	              (not understanding)
	          What?
	
	                    PIERSON 
	          I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate
	          phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to
	          tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon,
	          this isn't an everyday occurrence
	          around here.
	
	                    ROY
	              (low; getting it)
	          Ate the gun. Oh.
	
	                    PIERSON 
	          Someone who knows her well could
	          still identify her, that's not the
	          problem. It's just there's, uh,
	          it's likely to be a shock.
	
	                    ROY
	              (opening the door)
	          Well, let's get the shock over
	          with.
	
	INT. MORGUE VIEWING ROOM - DAY
	
	A bare bright room with tiled walls, a few plastic chairs, an
	ordinary office door on one side and wide hospital swinging
	doors on the other. Pierson and Roy stand watching.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Not many laughs in this room, eh?
	
	                    PIERSON 
	          Not many.
	
	The swinging doors open and an ATTENDANT wheels in a gurney
	containing a body covered by a sheet. Roy braces himself. The
	attendant pulls the sheet away from the face.
	
	                    PIERSON (CONT'D)
	              (to the attendant)
	          Remove that. We'll want a full, uh,
	          identification.
	
	The attendant removes the sheet. The body wears a nightgown.
	
	AN ANGLE on Roy, swallowing bile, as he forces himself to
	move forward and look down at the face. He immediately looks
	away again.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Oh, Jesus.
	
	                    PIERSON 
	          No question, huh?
	
	                    ROY 
	          No, its -- Why did she--?
	
	He forces himself to look at the body again, his own face
	full of the unanswerable question. He looks her up and down,
	then his eyes stop. He focuses on something, a look of
	surprise coming into his eyes.
	
	Roy's POV: CU, the body's hands, crossed over the stomach,
	the wrists crossed, the palms down, the clear backs of both
	hands visible.
	
	CU, Roy. He knows. Sharpness comes back into his expression.
	
	                    PIERSON  (O.S.)
	          That's that, then.
	
	                    ROY
	              (starting to grin)
	          Oh, yeah. That's that.
	
	TWO SHOT, Roy and Pierson. Pierson wants to leave, but Roy
	stands over the gurney. He chuckles. Pierson looks at him,
	surprised and appalled. Roy ignores him.
	
	                    ROY (CONT'D)
	              (laughing quietly)

	Myra's Cadillac drives slowly past, comes to a stop at the
	curb half a block away.
	
	INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
	
	AN ANGLE through the windshield at the driver, a woman,
	deeply weary. Her forearms are crossed on top of the steering
	wheel, her brow resting on the forearms. The burn on the back
	of her right hand is visible in illumination from a nearby
	streetlight. Traffic goes by. BEAT. Lilly lifts her head,
	looking out at the night. She's very tired, but determined.
	
	AN ANGLE beside Lilly, inside the car. From the seat beside
	her she picks up Myra's large dangly earrings and fixes them
	in place. Then she puts on Myra's big-lensed dark sunglasses.
	(She's wearing the clothes Myra wore when checking into the
	motel.) Lilly checks her appearance in the rearview mirror,
	then gets out of the car.
	
	INT. MADERO LOBBY - NIGHT
	
	AN ANGLE on Simms at the desk, talking to a TELEPHONE
	REPAIRMAN steadily at work fixing the switchboard.
	
	                    SIMMS
	          The last modern thing I liked was
	          the miniskirt. Your technology,
	          now, nobody understands it, and
	          that's the simple fact of the
	          situation.
	
	Lilly enters in b.g., crosses to the elevator, presses the
	button. Simms waves to her.
	
	                    SIMMS
	              (calling) )
	          Evening, Mizz Langley!
	
	The elevator door opens, Lilly boards and presses the button.
	The elevator door closes.
	
	                    SIMMS
	          New things come in here all the

	          your Ph.Ds, your highly educated,
	          intelligent, professional people,
	          you can say to them, how does that
	          work, and you know what they'll
	          tell you? You plug it in. And
	          that's the way the donut dunks.
	
	EXT. MADERO APARTMENTS BALCONY - NIGHT
	
	The balcony leading to Roy's apartment. It's illuminated by a
	light next to the public door from the interior hall.
	AN ANGLE on that door as Lilly cautiously opens it, looks out
	and around while remaining mostly behind the door, then
	focuses on the light. She reaches out and unscrews the bulb.
	GO TO BLACK.
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Roy's place. Dark. SOUNDS of lock being picked. The door
	opens, showing only blackness outside, Lilly enters and shuts
	the door, then switches on the main light.
	
	Ah ANGLE on Lilly, in the middle of the room, distractedly
	biting her thumbnail as she looks around, calculating. She
	looks directly at something.
	
	Lilly's POV: One of the box-framed pictures hanging on the
	wall.
	
	PREVIOUS SHOT. Lilly, making up her mind, crosses to the
	picture and takes it off the wall. She finds it surprisingly
	heavy. She carries it to the coffee table, puts it down there
	on its back, sits on the sofa.
	
	AN ANGLE on Lilly studying the picture. She raps her knuckle
	against the sides, looks to see if the front or sides open
	someway, and finally turns the picture over, laying it face
	down on the coffee table. She sees how to remove the back,
	lifts it off, and looks at the stacks of money lying in
	there.
	
	CU, Lilly, almost fainting with relief.
	
	WIDE SHOT. Lilly looks at the other picture, looks again at
	the money, comes to a conclusion. She rises and leaves the
	room, deeper into the apartment.
	
	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Lilly switches on the light as she enters the room. She looks
	around, crosses to the closet, goes through the stuff in
	there, finds an old attache case on the shelf. She brings it
	out, puts it on the bed, opens it. Inside are a few decks of
	cards and a paperback book. She tosses them onto the bed,
	checks the case, finds that one of the clasps works but the
	other doesn't. One is good enough. She carries the attache
	case out of the room, leaving the light on.
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Lilly enters, puts the case on the coffee table beside the
	picture, scoops the money out of the picture and puts it in
	the case. Then she unceremoniously dumps the picture on the
	floor.
	
	Lilly takes the second picture from the wall, puts it face
	down on the coffee table, opens the back, transfers the money
	to the case. She closes the case, attaches the one clasp that
	works, picks up the case.
	
	                    ROY (O.S.)
	          Hello, Lilly.
	
	TWO SHOT, as Lilly whirls around, terrified and then
	relieved. Roy stands in the open apartment doorway, blackness
	behind him.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Oh! Roy! You scared me.
	
	Roy enters the room and shuts the door.
	
	                    ROY
	          Going somewhere?
	
	                    LILLY
	          Somewhere else, that's for sure.
	
	                    ROY
	          I just came back from Phoenix.
	
	                    LILLY 
	              (anxious)
	          Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
	
	                    ROY
	          Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down.
	          Take a minute, tell me about it.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          I've really got to --
	
	                    ROY
	          You're dead, Lilly, it worked.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Not for long. Not when they do a
	          fingerprint check.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Why should they? The cops are
	          satisfied.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Bobo won't be. He'll spend the
	          money to make sure.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Even so. You still got time. Relax
	          a minute, tell me what happened.
	          Sit down.
	
	He gestures at the sofa. Lilly's holding the attache case.
	The gutted pictures are lying around, one on the coffee table
	and one on the floor. She looks around at everything, awkward
	and embarrassed. But Roy hasn't said anything. And he's
	between her and the door.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Just for a minute.
	
	She backs up, sits on the sofa, puts the case on her lap. Roy
	pulls a chair over so it's directly between Lilly and the
	door. He sits, looking at her with polite interest.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Myra followed you, huh?
	
	                    LILLY
	          She must have been the one that
	          blew me off with Bobo. I guess to
	          get me running. Did you tell her
	          about my stash?
	
	                    ROY
	              (isn't worth discussing)
	          No.
	
	                    LILLY
	          No, you wouldn't. That's what she
	          was after, though. But why hit on
	          me?
	
	                    ROY 
	          I wouldn't go in on a deal with
	          her. She blamed you for it.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (a shaky laugh)
	          As though you do what I say.
	
	                    ROY
	              (cold grin)
	          That's pretty funny, all right.
	          What happened in Phoenix?
	
	Remembered emotion makes Lilly talk in little fast clusters
	of words.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Roy, it was terrible. You read
	          about people killing people and all
	          that, but when it happens, my God.
	
	EXT. ARIZONA MOTEL - NIGHT
	
	Myra, in nightgown, carrying the ice bucket, approaches Room
	131.
	
	                    LILLY
	          She was in her nightgown, you know,
	          the old grifter's dodge, nightgown
	          and the Ice bucket and she just got
	          into the wrong room by mistake.
	
	INT. ROOM 131 - NIGHT
	
	CU, Lilly asleep. Very dim light. The shadows shift on her
	face as Myra OUT OF FRAME approaches. Myra's hands ENTER
	FRAME, abruptly clamp on Lilly's throat. Lilly's eyes pop
	open wide, staring, her mouth stretches open. Myra's arms are
	locked straight, pressing her weight down onto her hands
	squeezing Lilly's throat. Lilly clutches at Myra's fingers,
	tries to reach Myra's face, twists and squirms, then suddenly
	lifts her arm up and behind her head, hand dipping under the
	pillow, coming out with the silenced gun, pushing the gun
	upward, straight-arm, the gun moving up OUT OF FRAME. SOUND
	of shot. Blood sprays Lilly's face. Myra's body drops down
	onto her, at an angle, so we can still see Lilly's horrified
	face over Myra's shoulder as Lilly gasps for breath.
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Lilly stares across the room, breathing hard, reliving the
	experience.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          I sat in there with her, I thought,
	          what do I do now? Run and I've got
	          Bobo and the law after me. Stay,
	          and how do I explain?
	
	                    ROY 
	          This way's perfect.
	
	Lilly sits back, showing that relief again.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a
	          break for me after all.
	          I've been wanting out of the racket
	          for years, and now I'm out. I can
	          make a clean start, and --
	
	                    ROY 
	          You've already made a start.
	          Doesn't look that clean, though.
	
	Here's the awkwardness. Lilly looks guilty and embarrassed.
	
	                    LILLY
	          I'm sorry. I hated to take your
	          money, but --
	
	                    ROY
	          Don't be sorry. You're not taking
	          it.
	
	Lilly reacts as though he's slapped her. But then she gets
	her determination back. She splays out both hands, palm down,
	on the attache case on her lap.
	
	                    LILLY
	          I need this, Roy. I can't run
	          without money, and if I can't run
	          I'm dead.
	
	                    ROY 
	          You must have some money.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Just a few bucks.
	
	                    ROY 
	          And Myra's stuff?
	
	                    LILLY
	              (scornful)
	          Her credit cards. How far am I
	          gonna get with that?
	
	                    ROY 
	          Far enough. Maybe up to San
	          Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace
	          new. Start over.
	
	                    LILLY
	          At what?
	
	                    ROY 
	          You're smart, Lilly, and you're
	          good-looking. You won't have any
	          trouble finding a job.
	
	                    LILLY 
	              (appalled)
	          A job? I've never had a legit job
	          in my life!
	
	                    ROY 
	          Well, you're gonna start, if you
	          hope to live through this. A square
	          job and a quiet life. You start
	          showing up at the track or the hot
	          spots and Bobo's boys will be all
	          over you.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (exasperated)
	          Roy, I know what to do with myself!
	          It's a big world out there.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Not any more. Lilly, listen, I'm
	          giving you good advice. I'm
	          following it myself.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (doesn't get it)
	          What?
	
	                    ROY 
	          I thought it over, and you were
	          right. You wanted me out of the
	          rackets, and now --
	
	                    LILLY
	              (bedeviled, aggravated)
	          Roy, that's fine, but I don't have
	          time for this. Bobo --
	
	                    ROY
	          I thought you'd be happy for me.
	          After all, you --
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after
	          me, and he's goddamn good! But so
	          am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I
	          survive.
	
	                    ROY 
	          I know you do, so that's why --
	
	                    LILLY 
	          And to survive, my way, I need
	          money.
	          Bobo knows about the stash in the
	          car, so I didn't dare touch it, not
	          if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that
	          leaves this.
	
	                    ROY
	          No.
	
	Lilly sits back again, brooding at Roy, trying to think how
	to get to him, how to get through him or around him. She
	sighs, licks her lips.
	
	                    LILLY
	          You want a drink?
	
	                    ROY 
	          I don't think so. You probably
	          shouldn't either.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice
	          water?
	
	                    ROY
	          Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
	
	                    LILLY
	          I'll get it.
	
	She stands, putting the attache case on the sofa next to
	where she was sitting. Roy, with a faint smile, watches her
	leave the room.
	
	INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
	
	Very small, little used. Dark. Lilly switches on the light
	when she enters, then leans against the counter, fists
	clenched and trembling on the counter in front of her. She
	grits her teeth, hyperventilates, stares around the room in
	search of escape, an answer, something.
	
	CU, Lilly's face, desperate, grim, but not giving up.
	
	WIDE SHOT. Lilly opens cabinets, finds two glasses, opens the
	nearly-empty refrigerator, gets ice cubes from a tray, puts
	them in the glasses, puts the partial tray back in the
	freezer compartment, fills the glasses from the cold water
	tap, puts the glasses on the counter, stares at them briefly.
	She then shakes her head, searches the kitchen some more, and
	finds a cookie sheet she can use as a tray. She puts the
	glasses on the tray, carries the tray from the room, leaving
	the light on.
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Lilly enters with the tray, crosses to Roy, presents the
	glasses, speaks as he reaches for one.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Take whichever one you want.
	
	He hesitates. It hadn't occurred to him Lilly might try to
	poison him or knock him out. He grins at her and takes a
	glass.
	
	                    ROY 
	          You wouldn't do that.
	
	Lilly takes the other glass, puts the cookie sheet on a
	table, looks down at Roy.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          You don't know what I'd do, Roy.
	          You have no idea. To live.
	
	                    ROY
	              (easy)
	          Oh, you'll live, Lilly.
	
	Lilly crosses back to the sofa, sits beside the attache case,
	pats it absently as though it is a pet and she's glad it
	didn't move, waited for her. She sips water, puts the glass
	on the end table.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          I know what's bugging you, of
	          course.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Oh? I didn't know anything was.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (twisted grin)
	          Oh, really? You've got a legitimate
	          complaint, Roy, I don't deny that.
	          I wasn't a very good mother when
	          you were a kid.
	
	                    ROY
	              (full laugh)
	          Not very good!
	
	She nods, accepting the correction.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          A bad mother. By any standards.
	          I've thought about it, you know,
	          from your side, since then. I know
	          just how bad I was.
	
	                    ROY
	              (closed against her)
	          Uh-huh.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          I wonder did you ever think about
	          it from my side.
	
	                    ROY
	              (not worth discussing)
	          Never.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          No, I guess not. It was pretty
	          lousy of me, I guess, to be a child
	          at the same time you were. Not to
	          stop being a child just because I
	          had a child. I guess I was a real
	          stinker not to be a grown-up when
	          you needed a grown-up.
	
	Roy didn't expect to be made uncomfortable and defensive, and
	he resents it.
	
	                    ROY 
	          What do you want me to do? Pin a
	          halo on you? You're doing a pretty
	          good job of that yourself.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          And making you feel bad at the same
	          time, huh? But that's the way I am,
	          you know, the way I've always been.
	          Always picking on poor little Roy.
	
	                    ROY 
	          For God's sake, Lilly!
	
	                    LILLY
	              (intense)
	          I gave you your life twice. I'm
	          asking you to give me mine once. I
	          need the money.
	
	                    ROY
	              (not worth discussing)
	          No.
	
	Lilly subsides back onto the sofa. One hand rests on the
	attache case. With the other, she sips water, puts the glass
	back down. Roy watches her, unmoving, expressionless. Lilly
	frowns, not quite looking at him.
	
	                    LILLY
	          You're getting off the grift?
	
	                    ROY 
	          That's right.
	
	                    LILLY
	          That's good. You don't really
	          belong on this side of the fence,
	          you know.
	
	                    ROY 
	              (amused)
	          I don't?
	
	                    LILLY
	          If you stayed a crook, do you think
	          you'd live to be my ripe age?
	
	                    ROY 
	          I don't see why not.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Well, I guess I got it wrong, then.
	          Seems to me I heard about a guy
	          just your age that got hit so hard
	          in the guts it almost killed him.
	
	Roy's again unexpectedly uncomfortable. He shifts uneasily in
	his chair, trying to think of a response.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Well, uh...
	
	                    LILLY
	          Sure, sure, that doesn't count.
	          That's different.
	
	                    ROY
	          Well, it doesn't matter, does it?
	          I'm getting out.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (intense)
	          And that's why you've got to get
	          rid of this money. If you keep it
	          around, it'll just make you think
	          how clever you are.
	          It'll be a temptation to get back
	          into the game.
	
	                    ROY
	              (full laugh)
	          Oh, that's it! You're stealing my
	          money for my own good! How very
	          motherly of you, Lilly.
	
	Once again, Lilly drops back against the sofa back. Another
	round in the fight is over. Roy watches her, patient, waiting
	for her to give up, seeing no other outcome.
	
	AN ANGLE on Lilly, frustrated, feeling the need to move, the
	pressure of pursuit. Her head turns back and forth, her body
	starts false gestures. Finally, abruptly, she gets to her
	feet, looks at Roy, looks away, picks up the attache case.
	
	CU, Roy, alert. He won't let her reach the door.
	
	AN ANGLE PANNING with Lilly as she prowls the room, pacing
	back and forth, the attache case swinging at her side.
	Finally, she stops, standing the attache case on the coffee
	table, her hand still on its handle.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Lilly.
	
	She looks at him, attentive without hope.
	
	                    ROY 
	          If I should get out of the racket,
	          that goes double for you. That's
	          why you've got to change your life
	          completely, go to some town, get a
	          square job, live like a john
	          yourself. If you try to do it your
	          way, what future is in it?
	
	                    LILLY 
	          A future. The only future I've got.
	
	                    ROY 
	          That money wouldn't last forever.
	          And then what? You'd be back in
	          some other part of the rackets.
	          Another Bobo Justus to slap you
	          around and burn holes in your
	          hands. This way, you've got to go
	          the square route. You could send me
	          a card when you're settled, I could
	          maybe help out sometimes...
	
	                    LILLY
	              (bitter laugh) )
	          That's what it is, isn't it? Keep
	          me down. Your turn to be in charge,
	          have the power.
	
	                    ROY
	              (stonewalling)
	          Just trying to help, Lilly.
	
	She sits on the sofa again, this time leaving the attache
	case to stand on the coffee table. She studies Roy,
	calculating.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Roy... What if I told you I wasn't
	          really your mother? That we weren't
	          related?
	
	                    ROY
	              (bewildered)
	          What?
	
	Lilly leans back again, but this time her manner is
	different; languorous, sexy. She crosses her legs, the upper
	leg swinging gently. She smiles gently, encouragingly, at
	Roy.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          You'd like that, wouldn't you? Sure
	          you would. You don't need to tell
	          me. Now, why would you like it,
	          Roy?
	
	AN ANGLE on Roy, understanding and not wanting to understand.
	
	                    ROY
	              (hoarse)
	          What's that all about? Of course
	          you're my mother. Of course you
	          are.
	
	TWO SHOT. Lilly leans forward toward Roy, inviting him.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (very soft)
	          Roy... Roy
	
	Roy will not let anything complicated come to the surface.
	
	                    ROY 
	          There's nothing more to talk about.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (very soft)
	          I have to have that money, Roy.
	          What do I have to do to get it?
	
	AN ANGLE on Roy, his face bruised-looking, eyes scared. He
	will not know what's going on. He shakes his head, not
	trusting himself to speak.
	
	AN ANGLE on Lilly, leaning forward, tension showing through
	the seductive manner.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          No? Won't you give me the money,
	          Roy? Can't I change your mind? What
	          can I do to change your mind?
	
	TWO SHOT, as Lilly gets to her feet and takes a step toward
	him. Roy's pressed back into his chair, trying to maintain a
	cold facade.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Lilly, Jesus, what are you doing?
	
	                    LILLY
	          Is there nothing I can do, Roy,
	          nothing at --
	
	                    ROY 
	          NO!
	
	They both turn away at the same instant. Roy turns to the
	side to pick up the glass of water, to break the spell and
	the tension. Lilly turns back toward the coffee table and
	picks up the attache case. Roy, lifting the glass to drink,
	turns forward again as Lilly spins forward, swinging the
	attache case at his head with all her might. The case crashes
	into the glass and into his face. Roy SCREAMS and topples off
	the chair, as the one remaining clasp on the case lets go and
	money goes flying, filling the air.
	
	AN ANGLE DOWN at Roy, face up, expression horrified, hands to
	his throat. A large triangle of glass is in his throat. Blood
	pumps thickly, fountaining up.
	
	CU, Lilly, staring down in horror. She lurches forward, but
	there's nothing to do. She stares around.
	
	ECU, wads of bills on the floor, getting bloody.
	
	CU, Lilly, in agony, but looking down, kicking.
	
	ECU, Lilly's feet kicking the bills away from the blood. 
	
	TWO SHOT, as Lilly drops to her knees beside Roy, who's
	already dying. Blood spurts less forcefully. His hands fall
	to his sides, eyes stare upward, mouth still moves slightly.
	Lilly, shoving money away with her hands now, stares at him,
	willing it not to happen. He stops moving. His eyes dull.
	Lilly clasps her arms around herself. She knows she doesn't
	dare scream. Lips drawn back in a snarl, teeth clenched, she
	HISSES her agony through her teeth. She HISSES; she HISSES;
	she HISSES. Then, slowly, she regains control.
	
	WIDE SHOT as Lilly gets to her feet. She seems dazed now,
	like someone who's just been in a traffic accident. She
	blunders around the room, kicks the attache case, bends to
	pick it up. She studies the clasp, sees it still works, goes
	back to her knees.
	
	LOW ANGLE, Lilly in f.g., Roy in b.g., as Lilly repacks the
	money into the case, wiping the blood from some wads onto the
	carpet. Finishing, she closes the case, then remains on her
	knees, bending over the case. She WEEPS grindingly.
	
	WIDE SHOT, entrance door in b.g. Lilly's weeping subsides.
	She gets wearily to her feet, and leaves the room. CAMERA
	HOLDS. SOUND of water running in sink. SOUND STOPS. Lilly
	reappears. She does not again look toward Roy. She picks up
	the attache case, crosses to the door, opens it, steps across
	the threshold, reaches back to switch off the light. GO TO
	BLACK.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	FADE IN:
	
	EXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
	
	AN ANGLE establishing the race track, Ruidoso Downs
	(pronounced Ree-oh-do-so), set among the beautiful mountains
	of New Mexico's Lincoln National Forest, as a white Chrysler
	turns in with a stream of cars moving toward the parking
	area.
	
	AN ANGLE through the open driver-side window of the Chrysler
	at LILLY DILLON, 39 but looking younger, beautiful but cold
	and watchful.
	
	WIDE SHOT, track in b.g. as Lilly parks the Chrysler, gets
	out, locks the car. As she walks toward the track, WIPE
	RIGHT, as SCENE TWO WIPES IN from the left. SCENE ONE CAMERA
	FOLLOWS Lilly as she walks across the large parking area.
	SPLIT SCREEN.
	
	SCENE TWO:
	
	EXT. SIDE STREET - DAY
	
	Downtown Los Angeles, near the courts and the business
	section. ROY DILLON, 25, handsome and charming but self
	indulgent, parks his orange Honda convertible, gets out,
	picks up a large ledger book from the back seat, goes around
	to open the trunk.
	
	AN ANGLE on the trunk, establishing the tools of the
	salesman's trade: catalogs, samples, ledgers full of manuals
	and product sheets. Roy adds the ledger from the back seat,
	shuts the trunk, walks away.
	
	EXT. 6TH STREET - DAY
	
	Roy walks around the corner near a bar/restaurant. As he
	approaches it, WIPE LEFT, the two half-width scenes
	contracting to one-third each as SCENE THREE WIPES IN from
	the right.
	
	SCENE ONE: Lilly approaches the track's entrance doors.
	
	SCENE TWO: Roy approaches the bar.
	
	SCENE THREE:
	
	EXT. SANTA MONICA BOULEVARD - DAY
	
	A baby blue Cadillac parks in front of a jeweler.
	
	AN ANGLE on the driver's door as MYRA LANGTRY, 36, beautiful
	in an impersonal calculating way, gets out, carrying a small
	jewelry care, and locks the car. At first glance, Myra looks
	rather like Lilly. (Myra always wears large dangly earrings,
	and usually wears big-lensed dark sunglasses.)
	
	SIMULTANEOUSLY:
	
	SCENE ONE: Lilly enters the track.
	
	SCENE TWO: Roy enters the bar.
	
	SCENE THREE: Myra enters the jeweler's.
	
	WIPE RIGHT AND LEFT, as SCENE TWO takes FULL SCREEN.
	
	INT. BAR - DAY
	
	AN ANGLE on a hurried bartender in a full bar, crowded with a
	NOISY lunchtime crowd. In b.g., Roy slithers his way to the
	bar, waving a bill in the air to attract the bartender's
	attention.
	
	AN ANGLE on Roy as the bartender comes to him. Roy puts the
	bill on the bar, holding it down with one finger, as he
	SHOUTS his order. The bartender looks down.
	
	BARTENDER'S POV: Roy's finger holds down a twenty dollar
	bill.
	
	AN ANGLE steep over Roy's shoulder, the twenty visible, as
	the bartender hurries away to get the drink. Roy's hand makes
	a fist, swallowing the twenty, opens, pushing a ten out onto
	the bar, holding it there with one finger.
	
	AN ANGLE on the bartender returning with a draft beer,
	nodding to other ORDERS shouted to him along the way, putting
	the beer down, grabbing the bill without looking at it,
	hurrying away.
	
	AN ANGLE on Roy, content, smiling, sipping his beer.
	
	AN ANGLE on the bartender, hurrying by, slapping Roy's change
	down, moving on, Roy nodding acknowledgement, reaching out.
	
	CU, the change, a ten dollar bill on top. Roy's hand closes
	over it.
	
	EXT. TOTE BOARD - DAY
	
	WIDE SHOT, the tote board at the track, showing the shifting
	odds on the horses for the next race, the amounts bet.
	
	CLOSE SHOT, number 3. Not much bet, odds 70-1.
	
	EXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
	
	AN ANGLE on Lilly, frowning at the tote board. She carries a
	large heavy shoulder-bag, which she opens, looking in it as
	though it were a file drawer.
	
	AN ANGLE on Lilly studying the contents of her bag, the track
	beyond her, the mountains visible out beyond the track wall.
	Lilly moves.
	
	AN ANGLE on a high-dollar betting window, as Lilly
	approaches, taking bank-banded wads of bills from her bag.
	
	EXT. TOTE BOARD - DAY
	
	A change of numbers sweeps across the board.
	
	EXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
	
	Lilly moves away from the betting window, tucking betting
	tickets into her bag.
	
	ECU, Lilly's bag, compartmented, with stacks of money, small
	envelopes and notes on notepaper in each compartment. Lilly
	carefully files the betting slips.
	
	AN ANGLE on Lilly looking out at the tote board.
	
	EXT. TOTE BOARD - DAY
	
	CU, number 3. Odds 32-1.
	
	EXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
	
	AN ANGLE on Lilly, not satisfied. She turns and goes back.
	
	AN ANGLE at the betting window as Lilly arrives and makes
	more bets.
	
	EXT. TOTE BOARD - DAY
	
	CU, number 3. Odds 32-1. CROWD NOISE INCREASES. The numbers
	shift: odds 26-1.
	
	                    CALLER (O.S.)
	          And they're off!
	
	INT. JEWELER'S OFFICE - DAY
	
	Very quiet, stately; abrupt contrast with the track. A slow
	ticking clock.
	Myra sits in the client's chair, while at the desk sits the
	JEWELER, a pleasant but overweight man of 40, who studies a
	jeweled bracelet through a loupe. He sighs, drops the loupe,
	shakes his head regretfully.
	
	                    JEWELER
	          Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Why? What's wrong?
	
	                    JEWELER
	              (personal emotion mixed
	               in)
	          You are a valued customer, as you
	          know.
	
	                    MYRA
	          But what's wrong?
	
	                    JEWELER
	          I can't understand a thing like
	          this. It's something you almost
	          never see.
	
	                    MYRA
	          What is?
	
	                    JEWELER
	              (holding up bracelet)
	          This is some of the finest
	          filigreed platinum I've ever seen.
	          But the stones, no. They're not
	          diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.
	
	                    MYRA
	          But they must be! They cut glass!
	
	                    JEWELER
	              (wry)
	          Glass will cut glass, Mrs. Langtry.
	          Do you know where it was purchased?
	
	INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
	
	An expensive hotel room, with a sunstruck day beyond the
	windows. Myra, naked, a few years younger, sits cross-legged
	on the bed and laughs at COLE "FARMER" LANGLEY, 55, stringy
	bodied, who stands naked, his back to us, hands on hips,
	presenting himself to Myra. She reaches forward, hand hidden
	by his body as she lifts something that was hanging on
	something at the front of him. She brings back the bracelet,
	looks at it, is delighted, puts it on, and then leans forward
	again toward the unmoving Cole, her head hidden by his body.
	
	INT. JEWELER'S OFFICE - DAY
	
	                    MYRA
	          It was a gift. It isn't worth
	          anything at all?
	
	                    JEWELER
	              (warm, encouraging)
	          Why, of course it is. I can offer
	          you -- well, five hundred dollars.
	
	Myra expected -- and needed -- a lot more. She's worried,
	tense, but stuck. She nods.
	
	                    MYRA
	          All right.
	
	                    JEWELER
	              (rising)
	          I'll get you a check.
	
	He leaves the room. Myra grimaces, in almost physical pain.
	
	INT. SECOND BAR - DAY
	
	Another crowded lunchtime bar. A big beefy BARTENDER moves
	quickly, carrying a draft beer.
	
	AN ANGLE on Roy, in position, finger holding bill down, as
	the bartender arrives, puts down the beer, reaches for the
	bill, stops, stares at the bill.
	
	TWO SHOT, the bartender and Roy, as the bartender gives Roy a
	very cold look. He knows, and Roy knows he knows. Roy tries
	an innocent smile, which doesn't work. Roy moves.
	
	CU, the ten dollar bill, as Roy grabs it, but the bartender
	simultaneously grabs Roy's wrist.
	
	AN ANGLE on Roy and the bartender as Roy tries to pull away
	and the bartender holds him with his left hand while reaching
	under the bar with his right. He comes up with a sawed-off
	baseball bat. Roy, seeing it, throws his free arm up to
	protect his head, but the bartender pushes the blunt end of
	the bat straight across the bar at a downward angle and hard
	into Roy's solar plexus, driving the air out of him and
	propelling him back away from the bar, leaving the ten. The
	nearest CUSTOMERS on both sides become aware that something
	happened, but nothing follows and they're already involved in
	conversations. The bartender scoops up the ten as he puts the
	bat away under the bar.
	
	AN ANGLE on Roy, arms folded across his torso, staring in
	shock toward the bar, where the space he filled has already
	been closed in by other bodies. Nearly retching, he stumbles
	toward the door.
	
	EXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
	
	AN ANGLE on four PEOPLE at a table, CHEERING a race,
	switching to disgust and despair when they lose, moving away
	from the table, leaving their betting tickets behind. Lilly
	passes by, smoothly and casually scoops up the tickets, moves
	on along a row of tables, and there finding more tickets.
	
	INT. JEWELER'S OFFICE - DAY
	
	Myra sits as before. The jeweler enters with a check, which
	he hands her. She looks up at him, making no move to leave.
	
	                    JEWELER
	          I hope you're not too badly
	          disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.
	
	                    MYRA
	          It's not your fault.
	
	                    JEWELER
	          You'll give us an opportunity to
	          serve you again, I hope. If there's
	          anything you think we might be
	          interested in...
	
	                    MYRA
	          I have only one thing now. Are you
	          interested?
	
	                    JEWELER
	          Well, I'd have to see it, of
	          course.
	
	                    MYRA
	          You are seeing it. You're looking
	          right at it.
	
	The jeweler is puzzled, then startled.
	
	                    JEWELER
	          I see.
	
	He turns away, goes behind his desk, sits down, looks at
	Myra.
	
	                    JEWELER
	          You know something, Mrs. Langtry? A
	          bracelet like that very rarely
	          happens. A fine setting and
	          workmanship usually mean precious
	          stones. It always hurts me when I
	          find they're not. I always hope -- 
	              (faint sad friendly smile)
	          -- I'm mistaken.
	
	Myra likes him better now, even though he hasn't solved her
	problem. She rises.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Thank you. For everything you felt
	          you could do.
	
	EXT. STREET - DAY
	
	Roy has been throwing up but is finished now. He's sprawled
	like a shot deer across the hood of his Honda, still
	clutching his stomach. A police car stops, the passenger COP
	gets out. He's suspicious at first.
	
	                    COP
	          Sir? Everything all right?
	
	The sight of the uniform forces Roy into gear. He
	straightens, smiling through his pain.
	
	                    ROY
	          Getting better. A bad shrimp, I
	          think.
	
	The con's suspicion changes to concern.
	
	                    COP
	          Want us to take you to a doctor?
	
	                    ROY
	          No no, I'm fine now, thanks,
	          anyway. Still got a lot of clients
	          to see.
	
	                    COP
	          Take it easy, now.
	
	                    ROY
	          Oh, I will.
	
	EXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
	
	Late afternoon. AN ANGLE on the parking area, where almost
	all the cars are gone and the few remaining are widely
	separated. The white Chrysler is one of these. Lilly walks to
	it from the track entrance.
	
	AN ANGLE on the Chrysler as Lilly opens the trunk, puts her
	bag inside.
	
	CLOSE UP, Lilly and the trunk. She takes betting tickets from
	her bag, sorts them, files them in envelopes in different
	compartments, puts some to one side, then sorts through these
	separated tickets, throwing some away, keeping some. She
	takes money from the bag, puts tickets in, closes the bag
	with the money on the trunk floor. Reaching farther in, she
	lifts the pad deep inside the trunk, lifts the metal floor
	panel, and reveals a cache mostly filled with money. She adds
	today's skim, puts everything away, puts the bag back on her
	shoulder, closes the trunk.
	
	EXT. MADERO APARTMENTS - DAY
	
	A shabby apartment hotel on Wilshire. An exterior hall
	balcony on each floor has the entrance doors to the front
	apartments. Roy's Honda makes the turn and enters the
	basement garage.
	
	INT. MADERO LOBBY - DAY
	
	Modest but clean. The owner, SIMMS, a sloppy garrulous old
	bore, talks with a potential RENTER.
	
	                    SIMMS
	          Put it this way, now. Say I rent to
	          a woman, well, she has to have a
	          room with a bath. I insist on it,
	          because otherwise she's got the
	          hall bath tied up all the time,
	          washing her goddamn hair and her
	          clothes and everything she can
	          think of.
	
	In b.g., Roy, still in pain, comes out of the elevator, waves
	to Simms, who waves back without pausing in his monologue,
	and crosses to the mailboxes.
	
	                    SIMMS
	          Now, your minimum for a room with
	          bath is three hundred a month, just
	          for a place to sleep and no cooking
	          allowed.
	          And just how many of these tootsies
	          make that kind of money and have to
	          eat in restaurants and buy clothes
	          and --
	
	Roy, carrying his junk mail and pretending not to be in pain,
	crosses to Simms.
	
	                    ROY
	          Mr. Simms.
	
	                    SIMMS
	              (fawning)
	          Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a
	          potential new neighbor, looking at--
	
	                    ROY
	              (uninterested)
	          Uh-huh. Mrs. Langtry may drop by.
	
	Simms doesn't like Mrs. Langtry, but can't say so.
	
	                    SIMMS
	          I'll send her right up.
	
	Roy goes back to the elevator. Simms continues his monologue.
	
	                    SIMMS
	          I had my first hotel thirty-seven
	          years ago in Wichita Falls, Texas,
	          and that's where I began to learn
	          about women. They just don't make
	          the money, you see, not regular
	          they don't, and there's only one
	          way they can get it.
	
	Roy enters the elevator.
	
	                    SIMMS
	          Now, that Mr. Dillon there, that's
	          the fine type of person I have in
	          mind for here. Like yourself, I
	          have no doubt. He's a salesman,
	          regular as clockwork, has a suite
	          here. Fine man. Now, about these
	          women. At first, you know, they
	          just go out and do it now and then,
	          just enough to make ends meet. But
	          pretty soon they got that bank open
	          twenty-four hours a day, and then
	          you've got trouble. Hookers and
	          hotellin' just don't mix.
	          You'd think the cops'd be too busy
	          catching real criminals, not
	          snooping around after working
	          girls, but that's the way the gravy
	          stains, as the saying is, and I
	          don't fight it. An ounce of
	          prevention is my motto.
	
	Myra enters from the front, looks across at Simms, points
	upward. Simms calls to her.
	
	                    SIMMS
	          Oh, yes, Mrs. Langtry, he's up
	          there, he's expecting you.
	
	Myra crosses to the elevator. Simms speaks more softly.
	
	                    SIMMS
	          If you keep out the women in the
	          first place, see, you keep out the
	          hookers, and then you keep out the
	          cops, and that's how you have a
	          clean place.
	
	EXT. ROY'S APARTMENT - DAY
	
	AN ANGLE along the balcony, with Roy's apartment door in f.g.
	and Los Angeles in b.g. Myra crosses to the door, opens it
	with her key, enters.
	
	INT. BATHROOM - DAY
	
	A small crowded old-fashioned bathroom. Roy, shirt open and
	trousers pushed down almost to his crotch, looks in the
	mirror at purplish greenish bruises on his stomach. He
	touches his stomach, winces.
	
	                    MYRA (O.S.)
	          Roy?
	
	He looks at the door, then grins at his reflection.
	
	                    ROY
	          Your medicine is here.
	
	He leaves the bathroom.
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
	
	Hotel furniture, shabby and anonymous. On the walls,
	contrasting with everything else, are two crying-clown
	pictures on black velvet, mounted in big boxy frames. Myra
	stands in the middle of the room, and Roy enters, shirt and
	trousers still disarranged.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (amused by clothing)
	          Well, well. In a real hurry, are
	          we?
	
	                    ROY
	          Always, for you, baby.
	
	He reaches for her, but she playfully holds him off.
	
	                    MYRA
	          You aren't taking me for granted,
	          are you?
	
	                    ROY
	          Taking you for granite?
	
	He grins, as his fingertip prods her breast.
	
	                    ROY
	          That isn't granite. If that fell on
	          me, it wouldn't hurt at all.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (playing along)
	          Are you sure?
	
	                    ROY
	              (pulling her close)
	          Let's find out.
	
	EXT. HIGHWAY PHONE BOOTH - DAY
	
	Lilly's white Chrysler is parked next to an open-air phone.
	Traffic whizzes by. Lilly talks on the phone, with pen and
	notebook at the ready. The racetrack is visible in the b.g.
	
	                    LILLY
	          I'm done here. Do I come back to
	          Baltimore?
	
	INT. OFFICE - DAY
	
	It could be an expensive, if gaudy, lawyer's office.
	Baltimore harbor is visible past the windows. IRV, the
	accountant, sits at a desk covered -- but neatly covered --
	with ledgers, computer printouts, etc. He speaks on the
	phone.
	
	                    IRV
	          Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.
	
	INTERCUT PHONE BOOTH AND OFFICE
	
	                    LILLY
	          Delmar? I never go out to
	          California. That's a thousand miles
	          from here.
	
	                    IRV
	          Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody
	          to handle playback this time. Come
	          on, Lilly, you don't argue with
	          Bobo.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (fatalistic)
	          I know.
	
	                    IRV
	          Take two, three days. Call when you
	          get there.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang
	          gleez on the way.
	
	This is Lilly making the best of the situation. She listens a
	bit more, GRUNTS a farewell, hangs up, moves to her car.
	
	INT. BEDROOM - DAY
	
	Again, anonymous hotel furniture. Roy and Myra naked in bed,
	he on his back, she straddling him, both moving gently. He's
	half feeling pleasure, half unconscious.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Roy?
	
	                    ROY
	          Mm?
	
	                    MYRA
	          Look at me.
	
	                    ROY
	          Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Roy? It this all we have?
	
	                    ROY
	          All? It ain't bad.
	
	                    MYRA
	          No more than this? 
	
	He tries to concentrate on her.
	
	                    ROY
	          What are you talking abut, Myra?
	          Marriage?
	
	                    MYRA
	          I didn't say that. You aren't
	          marriage material.
	
	He keeps watching her, ironic, hips moving. Looking for a
	distraction, she notices the bruise on his stomach.
	
	                    MYRA
	          What's that?
	
	She touches it; he flinches back, in real pain.
	
	                    ROY
	          Ow! Hey, what are you trying to do,
	          throw me off my game?
	
	                    MYRA
	              (laughing)
	          No, baby. Come to Mama.
	
	She folds forward onto him. He puts his arms around her. They
	rock together slowly.
	
	EXT. MOTEL - DAY
	
	The same mountains in b.g. as at the track. Lilly carries two
	small bags from her motel room, puts them on the back seat of
	the Cadillac, gets behind the wheel, drives away.
	
	INT. BATHROOM - DAY
	
	Myra, dressed, primps at the mirror, surveys herself
	critically, is reasonably satisfied, leaves.
	
	INT. BEDROOM - DAY
	
	Roy lies supine on the bed, semi-conscious, half-covered by a
	sheet. Myra, casual, not noticing his condition, leans her
	head in through the doorway.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Wore you out, did I? It's a good
	          woman you can't keep down, baby.
	
	He moves fitfully, CROAKS an attempt at speech.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Have a good sleep, baby. Call you
	          tomorrow. 
	
	He sits up, trying to grin and be easy.
	
	                    ROY
	          Wait'll next year.
	
	AN ANGLE across Roy's profile, with open bedroom door beyond
	him. Through it, the living room and outer door can be seen.
	Myra crosses the living room, opens the door. Bright sunlight
	pours in, emphasizing the sweat on his face. She closes the
	door, and he gives up trying to smile. Gingerly, he touches
	his bruised stomach, winces.
	
	                    ROY
	          Damn that guy.
	
	He's going to get out of bed, but movement creates pain. He
	sits back against the headboard, looks around, reaches
	painfully to the bedside table drawer, takes a quarter from
	it, studies the quarter, feels it with fingertips, places it
	on the back of his left hand, slowly moves the soft pads of
	his right palm over it, then turns the quarter over and
	repeats. Then he takes the quarter in his right hand, flips
	it, slaps it down onto the back of his left hand, SPEAKS
	simultaneously with the hands coming together.
	
	                    ROY
	          Smack.
	
	He looks away, right hand moving minimally on left hand.
	
	                    ROY
	          Heads.
	
	He lifts the right hand, nods, then flips the coin again,
	looks away, moves the right hand slightly.
	
	                    ROY
	          Heads.
	
	Again he's right. Again he repeats.
	
	                    ROY
	          Tails.
	
	He's about to repeat when a wave of weakness comes over him.
	He sits back, gasping, but won't acknowledge the problem.
	He forces himself to flip the coin, misses catching it, finds
	it on the blanket, flips it again, slaps it onto the back of
	the other hand, looks away.
	
	                    ROY
	          Tails.
	
	Right again. He prepares to flip the coin, but then his hand
	sags onto the covers, his chin drops, his eyes glaze.
	
	                    ROY
	              (whispered)
	          How much can I bet?
	
	INT. PASSENGER TRAIN - DAY
	
	The train runs through a forest, tree shadows making a light
	and-dark pattern. Roy, four or five years younger, sits with
	a three-core-monte gang, consisting of a DEALER, a spectacled
	SHILL beside him, Roy facing the dealer, a ROPER next to Roy.
	On a briefcase on the dealer's lap are three cards, face up:
	An ace and two deuces. Across the aisle, alone in the seats,
	sits MINTZ, a conman in his fifties, pretending not to watch,
	but watching with amusement.
	
	                    DEALER
	          That's between you two. I got
	          nothing at stake here, I'm just
	          dealing.
	
	                    SHILL
	          What if we both guess wrong? You
	          aren't gonna take...
	
	The dealer turns aside, allowing himself to be distracted. He
	and the shill ARGUE nonsensically. The roper nudges Roy, then
	reaches out and crimps the ace. Roy's doing a wide-eyed
	bumpkin kid; he stares at the roper in delight and amazement.
	
	AN ANGLE on the shill, arguing with the dealer but looking
	toward Roy and the roper, then increasing the force of his
	argument.
	
	AN ANGLE across the amused Mintz at the roper whispering to
	Roy.
	
	TWO SHOT, Roy and the roper.
	
	                    ROPER
	          We got him now! Put down that big
	          bill you got.
	
	                    ROY
	              (whispered)
	          The fifty or the hundred?
	
	                    ROPER
	          The hundred! Hurry!
	
	                    ROY
	              (doubtful)
	          The ace is what I want?
	
	The roper's having trouble keeping his patience.
	
	                    ROPER
	          Sure it is!
	
	TWO SHOT, the dealer and the shill, fake-squabbling, Roy and
	the roper seen in b.g. between their faces, Roy finally
	bringing out his wallet, withdrawing a bill. Relieved, the
	dealer and the shill cut the crap.
	
	AN ANGLE on the group as Roy puts his hundred dollar bill on
	the briefcase.
	
	                    ROY
	          Is that okay?
	
	The shill pulls a messy wad of bills from his inner pocket,
	uses most of it to cover the bet.
	
	                    SHILL
	          You're damn right that's okay.
	
	                    DEALER
	              (picks up the cards)
	          Whoever finds the ace, wins.
	
	ECU, the dealer's hands, shuffling the cards at lightning
	speed. He deals the cards out face down.
	
	INT. BEDROOM - DAY
	
	CU, Roy's sweat-covered face, eyelids fluttering.
	
	                    ROY
	              (whispered)
	          Dark in here.
	
	INT. PASSENGER TRAIN - DAY
	
	AN ANGLE on the group. Roy squints at the cards, light and
	dark playing on his face.
	
	                    ROY
	          Too dark. I just can't see.
	
	Casually, but too quickly to be stopped, he reaches across
	and plucks the shill's glasses off.
	
	                    ROY
	          Let me borrow these, will you?
	
	AN ANGLE across Mintz, surprised and amused, at the group in
	b.g., in consternation as Roy puts on the glasses and looks
	down at the cards.
	
	                    ROY
	          Now, that's better.
	
	ROY'S POV: The glasses are 'readers.' Through them, a large
	gray 'A' can be seen on the back of one of the non-crimped
	cards. Roy's hand reaches out and flips it over. It's the ace
	of spades.
	
	INT. BEDROOM - DAY
	
	AN ANGLE across Roy toward the doorway. Roy, eyes closed,
	smiles in triumph, then winces in pain. Mintz partially
	appears, hovering beside the bed, grinning at Roy.
	
	                    MINTZ
	          I didn't teach you that.
	
	                    ROY
	              (whispered)
	          You taught me a lot. Then I
	          invented.
	
	INT. AIRPORT DEPARTURE LOUNGE - DAY
	
	Weary bored people sit around waiting. Roy, 17, lugging a big
	suitcase, walks through, takes a seat near Mintz, who's doing
	card tricks for his own pleasure. Roy watches, then moves
	closer.
	
	                    ROY
	          Let me see how you did that one.
	
	                    MINTZ
	          Scram. Go home.
	
	                    ROY
	          I can't. I just left home.
	
	                    MINTZ
	          You're too young. You should be in
	          school.
	
	                    ROY
	          I am in school.
	
	Mintz peers at him, taking an interest. Then he holds up the
	five of spades, shows it to Roy, puts it back in the deck,
	shuffles, shows Roy the deck.
	
	                    MINTZ
	          Where's the five?
	
	                    ROY
	          In your other hand.
	
	Mintz grins slowly, turns his hand over with the palmed card
	showing.
	
	INT. BEDROOM NIGHT
	
	Roy slumps, eyes closed, half-smiling, with the fever Mintz
	hovering. Roy's smile fades, his fluttering eyelids grow
	still, his face slack. The fever Mintz fades and disappears.
	
	EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
	
	AN ANGLE on a large sign indicating "Los Angeles" straight
	ahead. CAMERA PANS DOWN and around 180 degrees to face the
	several lanes of heavy Los Angeles-bound traffic. LONG BEAT.
	Hundreds of cars rush by. CAMERA PANS with Lilly's white
	Chrysler as it comes along in the stream.
	
	AN ANGLE through the Chrysler's left side window at Lilly,
	driving, concentrating, biting her left thumbnail. She
	becomes aware that's what she's doing, shakes her head in
	irritation: She's trying to break herself of this habit.
	Ostentatiously she tucks the thumb into her fist, rests the
	fist on top of the steering wheel, where she can keep an eye
	on it.
	
	HIGH ANGLE on the westbound lanes. The Chrysler passes. Soon
	it's out of sight among all the other cars. LONG BEAT.
	
	INT. BEDROOM - DAY
	
	AN ANGLE across the unmoving unconscious Roy toward the
	doorway. The apartment door beyond the living room opens,
	throwing light on Roy, who doesn't react. Lilly enters, in
	silhouette, closes the door, crosses toward the bedroom.
	(Until she speaks, we can't be quite sure who this is. With
	the similarity between herself and Myra, this could be Myra.)
	
	                    LILLY
	              (hesitant)
	          Roy?
	
	No reaction. Lilly, getting worried, moves closer, through
	the bedroom doorway.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Roy? You asleep?
	
	His head moves slightly. He barely has strength to speak.
	
	                    ROY
	          Myra?
	
	She moves forward to the side of the bed, only her torso IN
	FRAME. She touches a hand to his forehead.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (startled)
	          My God!
	
	She turns, hurries back to the living room, looks around for
	the phone, crosses to it, dials, SPEAKS. Roy's eyes open, he
	frowns.
	
	                    ROY
	          Lilly?
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
	
	Lilly, hard and fast and urgent, on the phone.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Tell the doctor I work for Bobo
	          Justus, and this is an emergency.
	          Don't worry, he knows who Bobo is.
	
	INT. BEDROOM - DAY
	
	AN ANGLE down toward Roy, from above, he's weak but troubled.
	Eyes closed, frowning, whispering.
	
	                    ROY
	          Go away, Lilly. Go away.
	
	Roy's eyes close. He looks dead. SLOW FADE.
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
	
	The DOCTOR, a nervous heavyset man in his fifties, a drinker
	from the look of him, is on the phone in b.g., while Lilly
	prowls the room, looking at everything with distaste, then
	stopping to frown at the box-framed clown pictures. She
	doesn't get it. She touches one of the pictures, trying to
	understand. The doctor hangs up, turns to Lilly.
	
	                    DOCTOR
	              (lugubrious)
	          The ambulance is on the way, for
	          what good it will do.
	
	                    LILLY
	          What? He's going to be all right!
	
	                    DOCTOR
	          Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some
	          sort of accident. He's had an
	          internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding
	          to death inside.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Well, make it stop!
	
	                    DOCTOR
	          His blood pressure is under a
	          hundred. I don't think he'll live
	          to get to the hospital.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (icy, stern)
	          You know who I work for.
	
	He's uncomfortable, wants to dismiss that part of his life.
	
	                    DOCTOR
	          Yes, yes, but that's --
	
	                    LILLY
	          My son will be all right. If he
	          isn't, I'll have you killed.
	
	The doctor stares at her in astonishment, then in belief.
	SOUND of ambulance siren. To break the moment, he crosses to
	the door, opens it. Light bathes Lilly. The doctor steps back
	across the threshold, waiting for the ambulance. He looks
	back at Lilly, who stares at him.
	
	INT. AMBULANCE - DAY
	
	ECU, Roy, skin pallid, eyes closed and sunken, lips white.
	SOUND of siren LOUDER. SOUND SEGUES to CHILD CRYING. CRYING
	FADES.
	
	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
	
	A clumsy slum hotel fifteen years ago, with a tiny lobby, the
	DESK CLERK at a half-door in one wall. Lilly, at 24, enters
	from the street. This is a definite hooker, with bright
	maroon hair and a black-and-white miniskirt. She stops
	wordlessly at the desk for her key.
	
	                    CLERK
	              (handing key)
	          Your kid's in the back here. He's
	          crying.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Roy? He's always crying.
	
	                    CLERK
	              (sympathetic to Roy)
	          The kids beat him up, because his
	          home life is, uh, different.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (ironic)
	          I like you, too.
	
	The clerk shrugs. He doesn't like this tough broad. He turns
	and calls back into his office.
	
	                    CLERK
	          Roy, your mother's here.
	
	Roy, 10, comes reluctantly out to Lilly, sniffling and
	rubbing his arm.
	
	                    LILLY
	          So what's your story today?
	
	                    ROY
	          They twisted my arm.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (laughing lightly)
	          Only one arm?
	
	He tries not to cry, and shows her a space between his teeth.
	
	                    ROY
	          They knocked out my tooth!
	
	                    LILLY
	          Only one tooth?
	
	Roy's frustrated, unhappy, having nowhere else to turn.
	
	                    ROY
	          You always say that!
	
	Lilly won't take him seriously, but she relents enough to
	stop teasing him, and to pat his head, ignoring how he
	flinches away.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Come on, kid, let's see if there's
	          any food in the house.
	
	                    CLERK
	              (there's no food)
	          Hah.
	
	Lilly gives him a jaundiced look, walks Roy to the stairs and
	up. The clerk, scornful but sexually interested, watches her
	go.
	
	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
	
	ECU, Roy in a hospital bed, with more color in his face,
	breathing more normally. He begins to react to the sound of
	people speaking.
	
	                    MYRA (O.S.)
	          No, really, you're Roy's mother?
	          That's impossible!
	
	                    LILLY (O.S.)
	          Not quite. But I'm not sure who you
	          are, Mrs... Langtry, was it?
	
	Roy's eyes open, he looks toward the voices.
	
	                    MYRA (O.S.)
	          I'm Roy's friend.
	
	WIDE SHOT, Lilly and Myra facing one another across the foot
	of Roy's bed, in a two-bed hospital room. (The OLD MAN in the
	other bed sleeps through the scene.) Neither woman is yet
	aware that Roy's awake. Lilly looks Myra up and down, with
	obvious contempt.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Yes. I imagine you're lots of
	          people's friend.
	
	Myra moves one pace to the side, studying Lilly's face.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Oh, of course, now that I see you
	          in the light, you're plenty old
	          enough to be Roy's mother.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (sweet smile)
	          Aren't we all?
	
	                    ROY
	              (very weak, but amused)
	          Play nice. Don't fight.
	
	The women, startled, both move toward Roy, one on each side
	of the bed.
	
	THREE SHOT, Myra and Lilly both leaning over to look down at
	Roy's sleepy face.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Darling!
	
	                    LILLY
	          Roy. You're going to be all right.
	
	                    ROY
	          Sure I am. What made you turn up,
	          after all these years?
	
	                    LILLY
	          I'm working down in San Diego. Just
	          for a few weeks.
	              (awkward laugh)
	          Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost
	          son.
	
	                    ROY
	              (cold)
	          Nice to see you.
	              (turns to Myra)
	          What am I doing in here?
	
	                    MYRA
	          You were bleeding inside, honey.
	          Remember that bruise you had?
	
	                    ROY
	          You called the doctor, huh?
	
	                    MYRA
	              (reluctant)
	          Well, no, Roy. Your mother found
	          you.
	
	                    ROY
	              (tossing It away)
	          Oh, yeah?
	              (very casual, to Lilly)
	          Thanks.
	              (back to Myra)
	          How long do they say I'm in here?
	
	Myra's willing to fight with Lilly, but Roy's attitude toward
	his mother makes her uncomfortable.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Roy... Your mom saved your life.
	
	Roy turns his head, gives Lilly an ironic smile. Lilly waits,
	holding herself in.
	
	                    ROY
	          Yeah? Only one life?
	
	She nods, accepting that, but then responds.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Second time I gave it to you.
	
	Roy gives her a cold smile, then turns to Myra for the ironic
	explanation.
	
	                    ROY
	          I was kind of... inconvenient...
	          for Lilly.
	
	Lilly has nothing but contempt for Myra. To be humiliated in
	front of Myra -- and by her son -- is the worst thing that
	could happen to her. She makes as dignified an exit as she
	can.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Well... You're all right now, I
	          guess. I have to get down to the
	          track.
	
	                    ROY
	              (reluctant, but it's
	               necessary)
	          Thanks, uh, Lilly.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (awkward laugh)
	          Don't mention it.
	
	                    ROY
	          I guess I owe you my life.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (faint smile)
	          You always did.
	
	Lilly exits. Myra looks after her, curious.
	
	                    MYRA
	          "Down to the track?"
	
	Roy will not talk about this, with anyone. His response is
	cold, closing the subject.
	
	                    ROY
	          Her job.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (bright smile)
	          I want to know everything about
	          you.
	
	                    ROY
	              (easy grin)
	          You do. And once I'm out of here,
	          I'll remind you of the best parts.
	
	They smile flirtatiously at one another, both with their
	minds on other things.
	
	INT. BATHROOM - DAY
	
	Very messy, small. Myra showers. She finishes, emerges, wraps
	herself in a towel, opens the crowded messy medicine cabinet,
	removes cosmetics and other items, starts to tweeze her
	eyebrows. Doorbell RINGS. She looks irritated, ignores it.
	Long doorbell RING. Exasperated, she slaps the tweezers down,
	exits.
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
	
	Another furnished apartment, this one with Myra's clothing
	and dishes and glasses and other junk all over it.
	She crosses to the door, pulls it open. The APARTMENT MANAGER
	enters; a sullen, nervous, heavyset man.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (angry, but defensive)
	          You heard the shower, didn't you?
	
	                    MANAGER
	          I don't care about that. This time,
	          I gotta have the rent.
	
	Myra forces herself to be more pleasant.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Joe, I thought I was gonna be all 
	          right by now, I just need a little
	          more --
	
	                    MANAGER
	          It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my
	          wife. She knows what's going on.
	          This time, I gotta have the money.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Joe, you know you'll --
	
	In gesturing, Myra "accidentally" loses the towel, then wraps
	it around herself again as the manager stares nervously away.
	She smiles, knowing she's got him.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Joe, could we talk it over? Do you
	          want a drink?
	
	                    MANAGER
	          My wife sent me here, Myra. For the
	          money. She's waiting.
	
	                    MYRA
	          I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock?
	          Ten?
	
	                    MANAGER
	              (trying to be determined)
	          This time...
	
	                    MYRA
	          We'll work something out, Joe.
	
	She strokes his arm, smiling. He flees. She smiles till he's
	gone, then looks worried, leans her head against the door.
	
	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
	
	Roy, very comfortable in pajamas and robe, sits in a
	wheelchair beside the bed, with magazines lying handy on the
	bed. Myra, irritable, paces beside him.
	
	                    MYRA
	          I don't see why you're still here.
	          You look healthy to me.
	
	                    ROY
	          I just do what the doctor says,
	          babe.
	
	                    MYRA
	          You're just comfortable, that's
	          all. You don't even ask to go home.
	          You just lie around, let your mama
	          take care of you.
	
	                    ROY
	              (truly astonished)
	          Mama!
	
	                    MYRA
	          Who else is paying for all this?
	          You badmouth the woman all the
	          time, but you sure do take the
	          payoffs she gives you.
	
	                    ROY
	              (insulted)
	          I'll pay Lilly back, don't you
	          worry about that.
	
	                    MYRA
	          I don't like to come here, Roy.
	          Every time I do, your mother comes
	          in and makes remarks.
	
	                    ROY
	          That's just Lilly's way.
	
	                    MYRA
	          And you never defend me. You're
	          afraid of her.
	
	                    ROY
	          Oh, don't be stupid.
	
	                    MYRA
	          You're a mama's boy, if you want
	          the truth. 
	
	This is so absurd, Roy doesn't know how to respond.
	
	                    ROY
	          Are you kid --? I hadn't even seen
	          her in seven years!
	
	Lilly enters, smiling in self-confidence. A large ugly burn
	is on the back of her right hand.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Should my ears be burning?
	
	                    MYRA
	              (surly)
	          They might as well.
	
	Lilly gives her a mock-admiring look.
	
	                    LILLY
	          I heard those skirts were coming
	          back.
	
	Myra's not quite up to direct confrontation with Lilly. She
	glowers at Roy instead.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Get well soon.
	
	                    ROY
	              (easy)
	          Every day in every way.
	
	                    MYRA
	          I'll see you when you get home.
	
	Myra stalks out. Acting as though Myra hadn't existed, Lilly
	puts her bag on the bed, takes mail from it.
	
	                    ROY
	          What happened to your hand?
	
	                    LILLY
	              (casually dismissive)
	          Just a little accident. I went by
	          your place, picked up your mall.
	          Just bills, I'll take care of them.
	
	                    ROY
	          I can take care of my own bills,
	          Lilly.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (indifferent shrug)
	          Whatever you say. The manager says
	          your boss called.
	              (crooked grin)
	          Really pulled the wool over
	          everybody's eyes, huh?
	
	                    ROY
	          What are you talking about? So I've
	          got a job. So what?
	
	                    LILLY
	          Stop kidding me! Four years in a
	          town like Los Ang-gleez, and a
	          peanut selling job is the best you
	          can do? You expect me to believe
	          that?
	
	                    ROY
	              (spreads hands; it's
	               obvious)
	          It's there. The boss called, you
	          said so yourself.
	
	                    LILLY
	          And that dump you live in! Those
	          clown pictures on the walls!
	
	This reference alerts and worries Roy, which he tries to
	hide.
	
	                    ROY
	          I like those.
	
	                    LILLY
	          You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball
	          clown pictures? Commission
	          salesman? It's all a front, isn't
	          it? You're on the grift, I know you
	          are. You're working some angle, and
	          don't tell me you're not because I
	          wrote the book!
	
	                    ROY
	              (defensive)
	          You're one to talk. Still running
	          playback money for the mob.
	
	                    LILLY
	          That's me. That's who I am. You
	          were never cut out for the rackets,
	          Roy, and if you --
	
	                    ROY
	          How come?
	
	She considers him. His expression is jaunty, daring her. She
	gives him a somber answer.
	
	                    LILLY
	          You aren't tough enough.
	
	He's afraid she's right. He covers the doubt with a display
	of self-assurance.
	
	                    ROY
	          Not as tough as you, huh?
	
	                    LILLY
	              (dead serious)
	          No. And you have to be.
	
	She holds up her burned hand, showing it to him.
	
	                    LILLY
	          You asked me about this. You really
	          want to know what happened?
	
	He isn't sure he does; but what choice does he have?
	
	                    ROY
	          Up to you.
	
	                    LILLY
	          My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus,
	          back in Baltimore. When a long shot
	          gets too much action, I have to put
	          money on that horse at the track,
	          because it's the only way to get
	          the odds down.
	
	                    ROY
	          Sure.
	
	                    LILLY
	          The first day of the Delmar meet,
	          there was a nag called Bluebell. I
	          should have been on it. But that
	          was the day after you came in here,
	          so I stuck around to see how you
	          were gonna be.
	
	He would speak protest, deny, explain, but she cuts him off.
	
	                    LILLY
	          That was my choice, nothing to do
	          with you. I took a chance, and it
	          didn't work out.
	
	                    ROY
	          Bluebell came in?
	
	                    LILLY
	          I sent Bobo ten grand of my own
	          money, like it was the winnings
	          from my bets. I hoped that would
	          cover me.
	              (shrug)
	          It didn't.
	
	EXT. DELMAR DAY
	
	AN ANGLE on the exit doors toward the parking lot. Lilly
	comes out, self-absorbed, then sees something ahead of her,
	falters briefly, keeps walking, tries a very shaky smile.
	
	REVERSE ANGLE, as Lilly approaches her car. BOBO JUSTUS, 50,
	a blunt hoodlum in a good suit and a civilized veneer, stands
	leaning against the car, arms folded, squinting behind
	sunglasses.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Hi, Bobo.
	
	                    BOBO
	          Did I buy you that dress, you piece
	          of shit?
	
	Lilly's scared, startled, but trying to figure out how to
	play this.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Well, I guess so. You're the guy I
	          work for.
	
	                    BOBO
	          You work for me, huh? Then I just
	          may flush you down the toilet.
	          Drive me to the Durando.
	
	Bobo gets into the passenger seat, while Lilly nods
	convulsive agreement and hurries around to get behind the
	wheel. The car jolts forward, then smooths, and heads for the
	gate.
	
	INT. CHRYSLER - DAY
	
	Driving along the highway. Lilly concentrates on traffic.
	Bobo heavily watches her profile, finally speaks.
	
	                    BOBO
	          Bluebell.
	
	Lilly's eyes briefly close, her shoulders sag. Then she goes
	back to the silent alert person she'd been. Bobo nods.
	
	                    BOBO
	          How'd you figure you were gonna get
	          away with that?
	
	                    LILLY
	          I'm not getting away with anything,
	          Bobo.
	
	                    BOBO
	          You're fuckin right you're not. How
	          much did your pals cut you in for
	          on that nag, huh? Or did they give
	          you the same kind of screwing you
	          gave me?
	
	                    LILLY
	          I was down on that horse, Bobo. Not
	          as much as I should have been, but
	          there was a lot of action on those--
	
	Bobo taps a fingertip against the side of her head to shut
	her up. She shuts up.
	
	                    BOBO
	          One question. Do you want to stick
	          to that story, or do you want to
	          keep your teeth?
	
	                    LILLY
	          I want to keep my teeth.
	
	                    BOBO
	          Now I'll ask you another. You think
	          I got no contacts out here? That
	          nag paid off at just the opening
	          price. There wasn't hardly a
	          flutter on the tote board from the
	          time the odds were posted. There
	          ain't enough action to tickle the
	          tote, but you claim a ten grand
	          win!
	          You send me ten thousand dollars,
	          like I'm some mark you can blow
	          off!
	
	                    LILLY
	              (terrified, broken)
	          Bobo, no, I --
	
	                    BOBO
	          You wanna talk to me straight up?
	
	                    LILLY
	          My son --
	
	                    BOBO
	          Your what?
	
	                    LILLY
	          My son was in the hospital --
	
	                    BOBO
	          What the fuck are you doin with a
	          son?
	
	                    LILLY
	          He left home a long time ago. He
	          was in the hospital, up in Los Ang
	          gleez, real sick.
	
	                    BOBO
	              (utter scorn)
	          Motherhood.
	
	                    LILLY
	          I never fucked up before, Bobo.
	
	                    BOBO
	          You expect me to buy this?
	
	It's time for Lilly to show tough, and she knows it.
	
	                    LILLY
	          You do buy it, Bobo. I cost you,
	          and I'm sorry.
	
	Bobo thinks this over.
	
	                    BOBO
	          I got a lot of people work for me,
	          Lilly. I can't have shit like this.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (begging)
	          It'll never happen again. I swear.
	
	                    BOBO
	          It happened once. With me, that's
	          making a habit of it.
	
	Lilly drops back to her final position; fatalism.
	
	                    LILLY
	          You're calling the shots.
	
	                    BOBO
	          You got any kind of long coat in
	          the car? Anything you can wear home
	          over your clothes?
	
	                    LILLY
	              (deadened with fear)
	          No.
	
	                    BOBO
	              (doesn't matter)
	          I'll loan you a raincoat.
	
	Lilly drives, holding herself together.
	
	EXT. HOTEL DURANDO - DAY
	
	A tall expensive hotel on the coast north of San Diego.
	CAMERA PANS with the Chrysler pulling in and stopping at the
	entrance, then PANS UP the balconied facade.
	
	INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY
	
	Living room of a high-floor suite. CAMERA FACES across the
	room to the balcony and the view of the ocean. Entrance door
	to one side. A supermarket shopping bag is on the coffee
	table. Two THUGS sit on the sofa, watching TV.
	
	The door opens and Lilly enters, followed by Bobo. The thugs
	immediately rise and switch off the TV.
	
	                    BOBO
	              (to the thugs)
	          Take a walk.
	
	The thugs leave the room as Lilly crosses to stand between US
	and the view, followed by Bobo, neither looking out. Lilly
	turns to Bobo, who abruptly punches her hard in the stomach.
	She falls to the floor.
	
	ANOTHER ANGLE as Bobo steps across her and goes over to close
	the drapes over the view. Lilly sits up, watching him,
	waiting obediently. Bobo looks at her.
	
	                    BOBO (CONT'D)
	          Get me a bath towel.
	
	She gets up, hurting, and hurries to the bathroom. Bobo sits
	on the sofa, crosses his ankles on the coffee table next to
	the supermarket bag. He takes out and lights a cigar. Lilly
	comes back with a large white bath towel.
	
	                    BOBO (CONT'D)
	          You ever hear about the oranges?
	
	                    LILLY
	          You mean, the insurance frammis?
	
	                    BOBO
	          Tell me about the oranges, Lilly.
	
	He kicks over the supermarket bag. Oranges roll on the floor.
	
	                    BOBO (CONT'D)
	          While you put those in the towel.
	
	Lilly's very scared. She drops to her knees, spreads the
	towel, crawls around gathering oranges while she talks.
	
	                    LILLY
	          You hit a person with the oranges
	          in the towel, they get big, awful
	          looking bruises, but they don't
	          really get hurt, not if you do it
	          right. It's for working scams
	          against insurance companies.
	
	                    BOBO 
	          And if you do it wrong?
	
	                    LILLY
	          It can louse up your insides. You
	          can get puh, puh, puh...
	
	                    BOBO
	              (impatient)
	          What's that, Lilly?
	
	Lilly pauses, bent over, tightly holding an orange.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Permanent damage.
	
	                    BOBO 
	          You'll never shit right again.
	
	He gets to his feet, leaving his cigar in an ashtray.
	
	                    BOBO (CONT'D)
	              (hard, impatient)
	          Bring me the towel.
	
	Fumbling slightly, she folds the towel edges together to make
	a bag, then stands, brings the towel to Bobo. He makes a
	production out of getting his grip on the edges just right.
	She stands as limp as she can, just wanting to get through
	this. He looks at her without expression, rears back with the
	towel, swings it forward, lets it drop open. Oranges roll on
	the floor. Lilly stares, wide-eyed, recognizing reprieve.
	Bobo tosses the towel behind him onto the sofa, then gestures
	contemptuously for her to pick up the oranges again.
	
	TWO SHOT, closer, as Lilly turns, bending toward the oranges,
	and Bobo picks up his cigar, then lifts a foot and kicks her
	flatfooted, hard, in the back. She sprawls on the floor. He
	follows and drops to his knees on her back.
	
	AN ANGLE close on Lilly on the floor, Bobo's knees grinding
	back and forth into her back.
	
	AN ANGLE on Bobo, grimacing as he bears down, pressing his
	weight onto her back. He leans forward, left hand bracing
	himself on the floor beside her head as he reaches down with
	the cigar held in his right hand and presses the ember
	against the back of her splayed-out right hand.
	
	ECU, Lilly, clenching her teeth, tears squeezing from her
	eyes, simply bearing it.
	
	AN ANGLE on Bobo, catching a bad smell, looking back down
	behind himself at Lilly's body. This is the result he wanted,
	but it disgusts him. He straightens up, still kneeling on
	her, puts the cigar in his mouth, doesn't like its taste,
	removes it, braces his left hand against her back while he
	lifts off her, getting back up onto his feet.
	
	WIDE SHOT, Bobo stepping over her, expression repulsed.
	
	                    BOBO (CONT'D)
	          Go clean yourself up.
	
	He puts the cigar back in the ashtray as she rises, cradling
	her burnt hand. Not looking toward Bobo, hobbling with knees
	together, she starts from the room.
	
	                    BOBO (CONT'D)
	          The raincoat's on the bed.
	
	She leaves. He opens the drapes, then picks up an orange from
	the floor and steps out onto the balcony.
	
	EXT. BALCONY - DAY
	
	Bobo stands looking out at the ocean. He enjoys breathing the
	sea air. He slowly peels the orange, dropping pieces of peel
	over the side.
	
	Lilly appears in the doorway, wearing a too-large man's
	raincoat. Bobo doesn't seem to notice her at first, then nods
	to her.
	
	                    BOBO
	          Almost forgot. That ten grand of
	          yours. It's in the envelope by the
	          door.
	
	                    LILLY 
	              (tries for animation)
	          Oh, thanks, Bobo.
	
	                    BOBO
	          You want a drink?
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I
	          still gotta drive back up to Los
	          Ang-gleez.
	
	                    BOBO 
	          See your son, huh? Well, that's
	          nice. A side of you I didn't know,
	          Lilly.
	
	Lilly chances taking a step out onto the balcony. It's vital
	that she encourage this forgive-and-forget dialogue.
	
	                    LILLY
	          He's a good kid. A salesman.
	
	                    BOBO 
	          On the square, huh? And how are you
	          making out these days? Stealing
	          much?
	
	Bobo's being jolly now. Lilly's scared, but has to be jolly,
	too.
	
	                    LILLY
	          From you? My folks didn't raise any
	          stupid kids.
	
	Bobo's joshing now. He raises a humorous eyebrow.
	
	                    BOBO 
	          Not skimming a thing, Lilly?
	
	                    LILLY
	          Oh, well, you know. I just clip a
	          buck here and a buck there. Not
	          enough to notice.
	
	                    BOBO
	              (honest approval)
	          That's right. Take a little, leave
	          a little.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          A person that don't look out for
	          himself is too dumb to look out for
	          anybody else. He's a liability,
	          right, Bobo?
	
	                    BOBO
	              (this is his creed)
	          You're a thousand percent right!
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Or else he's working an angle. If
	          he doesn't steal a little, he's
	          steeling big.
	
	                    BOBO 
	          You know it, Lilly.
	
	                    LILLY
	          You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I
	          don't know what there is about it,
	          but it somehow makes you look
	          taller.
	
	                    BOBO
	              (delighted)
	          Yeah? You really think so? A lot of
	          people been telling me the same
	          thing.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Well, you can tell them I said
	          they're right.
	              (looks at sky)
	          I better get going. Roy'll wonder
	          where I am.
	
	                    BOBO 
	          Worries about his mother, eh? Give
	          him a hug for me.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          I will. So long, Bobo.
	
	Lilly leaves the balcony. Bobo eats more orange, looking out
	at the ocean. His expression is stern but calm.
	
	INT. CHRYSLER - DAY
	
	Lilly drives along the highway, weeping, shaking, teeth
	chattering. Her hands are both high on the wheel, the back of
	the right hand developing a large red burn.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Lucky! Lucky! Oh, am I lucky.! Am I
	          lucky!
	
	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
	
	Roy's appalled and embarrassed and ashamed by this story; the
	surface result is, he's mad at Lilly.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Lucky? You call that lucky?
	
	                    LILLY
	              (simply)
	          He let me live. He let me be his
	          friend.
	
	Roy in his agitation wheels himself back and forth in the
	wheelchair, bumping into things.
	
	                    ROY 
	          You don't put up with that! Nobody
	          has to put up with that!
	
	                    LILLY
	          You do if you're where I am. Where
	          you want to be. How'd you get that
	          punch in the stomach, Roy?
	
	He closes down, sullen, not caring if she believes him or
	not.
	
	                    ROY 
	          I tripped over a chair.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (calm maternal advice)
	          Get off the grift, Roy.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Why?
	
	                    LILLY (CONT'D)
	              (faint smile)
	          You don't have the stomach for it.
	
	He stares at her, hurt and angry. She stares back,
	unflinching. Angrily, he spins the wheelchair around, his
	back to her.
	
	Now she's hurt. She shrugs, speaks indifferently to his back.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          I just give you your life. What you
	          do with it is up to you.
	
	                    ROY
	              (his back turned)
	          That's right.
	
	She hesitates, then stalks out, shutting the door.
	
	Hearing the door close, Roy spins around in the wheelchair to
	face where she'd been. He starts to get up, pauses midway.
	
	INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY
	
	Angry, Lilly takes a step away from the closed door, then
	stops, looks uncertainly back.
	
	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
	
	Roy, on his feet now, stands still, indecisive.
	
	INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY
	
	Lilly shakes her head, turns firmly away, marches down the
	corridor.
	
	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
	
	Roy makes an angry gesture, drops back into the wheelchair,
	spins it around and wheels over to the phone. Quick and
	angry, he makes a call. SOUND of ring; SOUND of click.
	
	                    MYRA  (V.O.)
	              (filtered; little-girl
	               flirtatious)
	          Myra here. Sorry you missed me.
	          Tell me how to reach you and I
	          will, just as soon as I can.
	
	SOUND of answering machine beep.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Babe, I'm gettin out of here, and
	          that's it. Let's take some time out
	          this weekend, go down to LaJolla,
	          hit the beach, have some fun.
	          Forget all this other stuff, huh?
	
	Roy hangs up, sits in the wheelchair looking determined.
	
	INT. MADERO LOBBY - DAY
	
	Simms talks with a MAID.
	
	                    SIMMS
	          Your difference between your folded
	          towel and your clean towel is a
	          trip to the laundry. When you're
	          cleaning those bathrooms, what you
	          do, you pick up the towel, you give
	          it a good shake and a good look,
	          and you say to yourself, 'Would I
	          dry myself on this towel?' If the
	          answer's yes, fold it.
	
	Roy comes out of the elevator, crossing toward Simms.
	
	                    MAID 
	          What if it's wet?
	
	                    SIMMS
	          Mr. Dillon! Welcome back! You look
	          fine, just fine.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Thanks, Mr. Simms, I'm feeling
	          fine.
	
	                    MAID 
	              (shy)
	          I'm glad you're better.
	
	Simms hands Roy a stack of mail.
	
	                    SIMMS
	          You're well liked around here, Mr.
	          Dillon. The entire staff will be
	          pleased to see you're back.
	
	Roy's touched and embarrassed by this reaction.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Well, thank you. And thank them.
	
	                    SIMMS 
	          Sickness comes to us all, Mister
	          Dillon.
	
	                    ROY 
	          That's true, Mr. Simms.
	
	                    SIMMS
	          We never know when and we never
	          know why. We never know how. The
	          only blessed thing we know is,
	          it'll be at the most inconvenient
	          and unexpected time. Just when
	          you've got tickets to the World
	          Series. And that's the way the
	          permanent waves.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Well, I'm back now. I just wanted
	          you to know. Gotta rush.
	
	                    SIMMS
	          Happy to see you looking so good.
	
	Roy crosses back to the elevator, enters it. Elevator door
	closes. Simms looks after him, avuncular.
	
	                    SIMMS (CONT'D)
	          That fellow could be a congressman.
	              (turns to maid)
	          If it's wet, you don't fold it. You
	          shake it, and hang it neatly on the
	          rod provided.
	
	                    MAID 
	          Yes, sir.
	
	EXT. SARBER & WEBB - DAY
	
	A long low stucco building in an industrial section of Los
	Angeles. The company name is on the glass of the main door.
	KAGGS, a humorless hotshot of 28, dressed in short-sleeved
	white shirt and narrow dark tie, prowls the cracked sidewalk
	in front of the place, MAKING REMARKS into a small cassette
	recorder. Roy's Honda arrives and drives into the company lot
	at the end of the building. Kaggs watches, then goes on
	patrolling and TALKING into the recorder. Roy comes out to
	the sidewalk and heads for the entrance. Kaggs stops and
	watches him approach.
	
	                    ROY
	              (cheerful, confident)
	          Whadaya say?
	
	                    KAGGS
	              (uptight, minimal)
	          Hello.
	
	Roy continues on and enters the building.
	
	INT. SARBER & WEBB - DAY
	
	A low rail separates the visitors from an area of desks with
	CLERKS typing or adding up figures or TALKING on the phone.
	Beyond them are floor-to-ceiling bins and shelves with narrow
	aisles between, in which more CLERKS move busily, filling
	orders or doing inventory. A great sense of activity and
	hubbub. Roy enters, looks around in surprise. A clerk at a
	front desk sees him, stands happily.
	
	                    CLERK 
	          Roy! Welcome back.
	
	                    ROY
	              (approaching him)
	          What's going on? This is usually
	          coffee break time.
	
	                    CLERK 
	          Not since Kaggs showed up.
	
	Other clerks, aware of Roy, come over with AD LIB GREETINGS.
	
	                    ROY
	              (happily basking)
	          Hey, yeah, I'm fine, everything's
	          great. What's this Kaggs? Sounds
	          like a disease.
	
	                    2ND CLERK 
	          It is.
	
	                    CLERK 
	          Troubleshooter from the main
	          office. Came out here right after
	          you went into the hospital, and he
	          ain't had a kind word for anybody
	          yet.
	
	                    3RD CLERK 
	          Nobody knows anything but him.
	
	                    CLERK 
	          He chopped off half a dozen
	          salesmen; won't wholesale to them
	          any more.
	
	                    2ND CLERK 
	          What kind of sense does that make?
	          They're all on commission.
	
	                    ROY
	              (unworried)
	          You think he'll chop me?
	
	                    CLERK
	          If he does, he's crazy.
	
	                    2ND CLERK 
	          Here he comes!
	
	The clerks all hurry back to their desks as Kaggs enters. He
	crosses to Roy, hand stuck out.
	
	                    KAGGS
	          Kaggs. Home office.
	
	                    ROY
	              (taking his hand)
	          Roy Dillon.
	
	                    KAGGS
	              (keeping Roy's hand)
	          I know that. Knew it when I saw you
	          out there. The best salesman here,
	          which isn't saying much. Want to
	          talk to you, Dillon.
	
	Kaggs moves toward the gate in the rail, still holding Roy's
	hand, to move him along. Roy stands still, which yanks Kaggs
	back. Kaggs frowns at him, releases his hand.
	
	                    KAGGS (CONT'D)
	          What's up?
	
	                    ROY 
	          That was a pretty backhanded
	          compliment. If I let people get
	          away with things like that, I
	          wouldn't be a good salesman.
	
	                    KAGGS
	              (brisk)
	          You're right. I apologize. But I
	          still want to talk to you.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Lead on.
	
	Kaggs leads the way through the rail.
	
	INT. KAGGS' OFFICE - DAY
	
	Small, crowded, efficient, with interior windows showing the
	aisles of bins. Kaggs leads Roy in, shuts the door, gestures
	at the second chair as he goes behind the desk.
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          Take a seat.
	
	They both sit, Roy amused and observant.
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          When I said you being the best
	          salesman here didn't say much, I
	          meant for us. I know your record
	          with Sarber and Webb, and I'd say
	          you're a top-flight man, but you've
	          had no incentive. No one walking on
	          your heels. Just a lot of half
	          asses, so the tendency's been not
	          to stretch yourself. I'm bouncing
	          the slobs, incidentally.
	
	                    ROY 
	              (dry)
	          So I heard.
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          Makes no difference to me if
	          they're only on commission. If they
	          don't make good money, they're not
	          giving us good representation, and
	          we can't afford to have them
	          around. Ever supervise salesmen?
	
	                    ROY 
	          Just myself.
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          That's right, you've had to
	          supervise yourself. This place
	          needs a sales manager. Somebody
	          who's proved he's a salesman and
	          can handle other salesmen. He'd
	          have a lot of deadwood to clear
	          out, new men to hire. What do you
	          think?
	
	Roy doesn't yet know he's being offered the job.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Sounds like a good Idea.
	
	                    KAGGS
	          I don't know offhand what your best
	          year's been, we can look it up. The
	          idea is, we'll top it by fifteen
	          percent.
	
	Now Roy gets it. He's startled, almost scared, thinks
	automatically of escape.
	
	                    ROY 
	          What? Me?
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          That's just the first year. If you
	          aren't worth a lot more than that
	          the second year, I'll kick you out.
	          What do you say?
	
	                    ROY 
	          Well, uh... No.
	
	                    KAGGS
	              (astonished)
	          No?
	
	                    ROY 
	          I can't take that job! I mean, I
	          mean, I can't take it right away.
	          I'm still recuperating, I just
	          dropped in to say hello, see
	          everybody --
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look
	          a little pale. How soon will you be
	          ready? A week?
	
	                    ROY 
	          But you need a man right now. It
	          wouldn't be fair to you to --
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          I take care of the being-fair-to-me
	          department. Things've gone to hell
	          this long, they can go a little
	          longer.
	
	                    ROY
	              (trapped)
	          Well...
	
	Kaggs gets to his feet, terminating the meeting.
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          See you in a week, Roy. I can call
	          you Roy?
	
	                    ROY
	              (rising)
	          Oh, sure. Fine.
	
	Kaggs sticks his hand out for another shake. Roy obliges.
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm
	          afraid.
	
	                    ROY
	              (distracted)
	          Perk.
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
	
	Roy's place. Roy enters from the bedroom, carrying a
	suitcase, which he drops on the sofa. He goes to one of the
	box-framed clown pictures, takes it off the wall, puts it
	face down on the coffee table, removes two wing nuts holding
	the back, lifts off the back, and reveals stacks of money
	hidden inside. He takes two wads of money out, counting them,
	putting them on the coffee table, then fits the back in
	place, reattaches the wing nuts, and hangs the picture on the
	wall. Stuffing the wads of money into the suitcase, he
	leaves.
	
	EXT. UNION STATION - DAY
	
	A cab pulls up to discharge passengers. Roy and the DRIVER
	get out. Roy pays the driver, who opens the trunk to take out
	several pieces of luggage. Myra leans hesitantly out, as
	though afraid it's raining out there.
	
	                    ROY 
	          This really is it. Union Station.
	
	Myra comes out of the cab. She's feeling testy. Roy's in a
	good mood and ignores her bad temper.
	
	                    MYRA
	          I don't see why we have to take the
	          train.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Because it's comfortable.
	
	Myra and Roy burden themselves with the luggage.
	
	                    MYRA
	          What if we want to drive somewhere
	          while we're there?
	
	                    ROY
	          We'll rent a car.
	
	They start for the station.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Big spender.
	
	                    ROY
	          You ain't seen nothin.
	
	INT. TRAIN DAY
	
	AN ANGLE from outside the passenger car through the window at
	Myra, mulish, watching the scenery go by. Beyond her Roy's
	easy, content. He moves to get up.
	
	TWO SHOT, within the train. Myra looks questioningly at Roy
	as he stands.
	
	                    ROY
	          Stretch my legs. Come along?
	
	She's not ready to relent and enjoy herself.
	
	                    MYRA
	          No.
	
	                    ROY
	              (unruffled)
	          See you soon.
	
	He walks down the aisle behind Myra, who sighs and looks out
	the window again.
	
	INT. BAR CAR - DAY
	
	Four young SOLDIERS sit at a table in a rudimentary bar car.
	They're drinking bloody Marys out of plastic glasses and
	having a good time together. In b.g., several customers are
	clustered at the small service bar, waiting for drinks.
	
	AN ANGLE on Roy, at the service bar, looking back past other
	people at the soldiers. He gets his mixed drink, in a plastic
	glass, and turns away.
	
	AN ANGLE on the soldiers as Roy starts by. The train lurches,
	and Roy falls heavily against their table, slopping their
	drinks and spilling some of his own on the table.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Oh! Ow, I'm sorry! Oh, look, I
	          spilled your drinks!
	
	                    SOLDIER
	          That's okay, don't worry about it.
	
	                    SOLDIER 2
	          You okay, pal?
	
	                    ROY
	          Let me buy you a new round.
	
	                    SOLDIER
	          Hey, no, no problem.
	
	                    SOLDIER 3
	          You didn't like spill much at all.
	
	Roy firmly places his own glass on their table.
	
	                    ROY 
	          What are those, bloody Marys? Watch
	          this, I'll be back.
	
	He leaves, while the soldiers are still PROTESTING.
	
	INT. TRAIN - DAY
	
	Myra applies makeup, watching herself in her compact mirror.
	She becomes aware of eyes, and looks around.
	
	TWO SHOT, Myra and a BUSINESSMAN, sitting across the way,
	grinning at her. Myra registers him.
	
	CU, Myra, considering the possibilities. Then she shrugs,
	shakes her head at the businessman almost reluctantly, and
	goes back to applying makeup.
	
	INT. BAR CAR - DAY
	
	Roy now sits with the soldiers, eagerly listening to them
	talk. There are plastic glasses enough on the table for three
	rounds of drinks.
	
	                    SOLDIER 3
	              (to Soldier 2)
	          Yeah, but it was you like told the
	          sergeant your grandmother was dead.
	
	                    SOLDIER
	              (laughing)
	          Again!
	
	                    SOLDIER 2
	              (to Soldier 3)
	          And you jumped right in.
	              (broad imitation)
	          I'll drive him, Sarge, he's too
	          distraught.
	
	                    SOLDIER 4
	              (astonished)
	          Distraught? You said distraught?
	
	They all laugh, Roy laughing with them.
	
	                    ROY
	          Boy! You guys could've got in a lot
	          of trouble.
	
	                    SOLDIER 3
	          Nah. Old Sarge, he's slowing down.
	
	                    ROY
	          I don't know. I wouldn't take a
	          chance like that.
	              (looks at floor)
	          What's that?
	
	They watch as he bends, picks up one die from the floor,
	holds it where they can all see it, his manner open,
	guileless.
	
	                    ROY (CONT'D)
	          One of you fellows drop this?
	
	INT. TRAIN - DAY
	
	Myra walks down the aisle, demurely looking at no one.
	
	INT. BAR CAR - DAY
	
	Roy's getting to his feet, the soldiers protesting.
	
	                    SOLDIER 2
	          You can't buy every round!
	
	                    SOLDIER 3 
	          Like our turn!
	
	                    ROY 
	          Tell you what. We'll roll for it.
	          Low number buys.
	
	He hands the die to Soldier 2.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Go ahead. You roll for the four of
	          you.
	
	The soldiers are confused but agreeable, seeing this as some
	kind of fun.
	
	                    SOLDIER 2 
	          Here goes.
	
	He tosses the die on the table.
	
	                    SOLDIER 3 
	          That's a four!
	
	Roy picks up the die.
	
	AN ANGLE close on Roy, his eyes glittering, his fist with the
	die shaking beside his head.
	
	WIDE SHOT. Roy throws. They all look at the die. Roy spreads
	his hands; the good sport.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Told you I'd buy.
	
	                    SOLDIER 
	          It just doesn't seem fair, Tom.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Tell you what. Give me a chance to
	          get even when I come back.
	
	INT. TRAIN - DAY
	
	Myra reaches the end of one car, starts through.
	
	INT. BAR CAR - DAY
	
	AN ANGLE on Myra about to enter. She stops, looking through
	the glass in the door.
	
	Myra's POV: Roy and the soldiers rolling the die for money.
	
	ECU, Myra, absorbed, watching.
	
	Myra's POV: MOS through the glass. ECU, Roy's hand with the
	die. ECU, Roy's profile, his smile, his innocent distress
	when he wins. ECU, Roy's hand scoops money.
	
	ECU, Myra, smiling, pleased.
	
	INT. DINER - NIGHT
	
	A brightly lit Hopperish place. Lilly sits alone in a booth
	eating a bowl of chili and reading a newspaper folded beside
	the bowl. A DRUNK with a great deal of faith in his own charm
	sits with a male FRIEND at the counter, drinking coffee. The
	drunk keeps looking toward Lilly, grinning, COMMENTING
	playfully to his friend, who's bored by it all. Lilly doesn't
	seem to be aware of him.
	
	The drunk rises from his stool, turning toward Lilly,
	staggering slightly. His friend makes a small move to stop
	him, then shrugs and lets him go. The drunk makes his way to
	Lilly's table, leans on it.
	
	                    DRUNK 
	          Pretty woman like you shouldn't eat
	          alone. Whadaya wanna eat alone for?
	
	Lilly gives him a flat look.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Go away.
	
	She looks past him toward the WAITRESS behind the counter.
	
	                    LILLY (CONT'D)
	              (calling)
	          Could I have some coffee, please?
	
	                    WAITRESS 
	          Right away.
	
	                    DRUNK 
	          We could have coffee together. My
	          name's Kenny.
	
	Lilly looks over at the drunk's friend, who pointedly ignores
	the situation.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Your pal wants you.
	
	The drunk could turn mean; his gesture brushing away the idea
	of his friend is stronger than necessary.
	
	                    DRUNK
	          Let him find his own pretty woman.
	
	The waitress arrives, with the coffee pot and a mug. She puts
	the mug on the table, pours coffee.
	
	                    WAITRESS
	          This fellow bothering you, Ma'am?
	
	                    LILLY
	          Yes.
	
	                    WAITRESS
	              (to the drunk)
	          Why don't you go sit down?
	
	                    DRUNK
	          I'll sit here. Move over.
	
	The drunk wants to sit beside Lilly, who looks to the
	waitress to solve the problem, but the waitress stands there
	with the coffee pot, looking helpless. The drunk bends to
	slide onto the seat. Lilly, exasperated, rabbit punches him
	in the throat.
	
	The drunk, astounded and in pain (and not breathing),
	staggers back, flailing, hitting the waitress's arm so that
	she slops coffee on him as his feet tangle and he falls
	heavily onto the floor.
	
	Lilly, suddenly concerned, slides out of the booth.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Oh! Are you all right?
	
	She goes to one knee beside the drunk, who clutches his own
	throat with both hands, retching as he tries to inhale. Lilly
	looks up at the astonished waitress.
	
	                    LILLY (CONT'D)
	          I shouldn't have hit him that hard.
	          I guess I don't know my own
	          strength.
	
	The drunk's friend arrives and helps Lilly get the drunk to
	his feet. The drunk is breathing now, but shaken. He looks at
	Lilly with reproachful eyes. His friend transfers his
	annoyance at the drunk to Lilly.
	
	                    FRIEND 
	          You didn't have to do that.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (matter of fact)
	          I thought I did. You should take
	          better care of your friend.
	
	                    DRUNK
	              (mumbled)
	          Outta here.
	
	The drunk and his friend head for the exit, as Lilly turns to
	the waitress.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          I'm sorry a lady can't eat in here
	          without being bothered.
	
	The waitress is apologetic, and also in awe of Lilly.
	
	                    WAITRESS 
	          It won't happen again, Ma'am, I
	          promise. Dinner's on the house.
	          More chili? Dessert? We have lovely
	          pecan pie, my husband makes it
	          himself.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          That sounds nice. Pecan pie. Thank
	          you.
	
	Lilly sits down as the waitress goes back behind the counter.
	
	AN ANGLE on the waitress, as she puts down the coffee pot,
	brings out the pecan pie, prepares to slice it, pauses, looks
	with wonder toward Lilly.
	
	EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
	
	The setting is a wide porch or lanai pretending to be a 19th
	century locale; a mix of western and antebellum south; the
	usual tourist confusion of histories. The effect is both
	romantic and false. Roy and Myra linger over wine, near the
	end of their meal. Roy's relaxed, happy, expansive. Myra's
	pleased but watchful, the bird watching the worm.
	
	                    ROY 
	          You were right, I had to get out of
	          that hospital. Nothing wrong with
	          me any more.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (purring)
	          I'll sign that affidavit.
	
	                    ROY
	          Great to get away, take it easy.
	          Next week, I'll get back to work.
	
	                    MYRA
	          You already went back to work.
	
	                    ROY
	              (confused)
	          What?
	
	                    MYRA
	              (indulgent smile)
	          I watched you. Working the tap on
	          those soldier boys.
	
	                    ROY
	              (elaborate innocence)
	          Working the what?
	
	                    MYRA
	          Oh, come on, Roy.
	
	She mimes rolling the die, slowly, showing how it will roll
	out of her hand just so, then speaks to him as though to a
	bright child.
	
	                    MYRA
	          The tap. What you do for a living.
	
	                    ROY
	          I'm a salesman.
	
	                    MYRA
	          You're on the grift. Same as me.
	
	                    ROY
	              (demonstrating patience)
	          Myra, I'm not following this.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (demonstrating
	               exasperation)
	          Roy, you're a short-con operator.
	          And a good one, I think. Don't talk
	          to me like I'm another square.
	
	Roy leans back, studying her, thinking it over, makes up his
	mind.
	
	                    ROY 
	          You talk the lingo. What's your
	          pitch?
	
	                    MYRA 
	          The long end. Big con.
	
	                    ROY
	              (shaking his head)
	          Nobody does that single-o.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          I was teamed ten years with the
	          best in the business. Cole Langley.
	
	                    ROY 
	          I've heard the name.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          It was beautiful. And getting
	          better all the time.
	
	                    ROY
	              (skeptical)
	          Is that right?
	
	                    MYRA
	              (enthusiasm building)
	          It is, Roy! And now, right now,
	          it's the perfect time, the best
	          time since I've been in the game.
	
	EXT. DESERTED DOWNTOWN - DAY
	
	New skyscrapers are separated by blank fields or small older
	buildings. Almost no traffic. A white limo drives alone down
	the street.
	
	                    MYRA (V.O.) 
	          All over the southwest, you've got
	          these businessmen, they were making
	          money when everybody was making
	          money, they think that means
	          they're smart.
	
	INT. LIMO - DAY
	
	Myra, dressed expensively and fashionably, sits with
	GLOUCESTER HEBBING, a stocky businessman, sixtyish. Their
	manner suggests intimacy.
	
	                    MYRA (V.O.)
	          And now they're hurting. Everything
	          they had was because of oil.
	
	EXT. NEW BUILDING - DAY
	
	Glossy, but no people around. The limo stops, the mustached
	CHAUFFEUR hops out and holds the door as Myra and Hebbing
	emerge and cross to enter the building, Myra carrying an
	attache case.
	
	                    MYRA (V.O.)
	          They still got money, but they need
	          more money, and that's just the
	          kind of guy Cole and me like.
	
	INT. LIMO - DAY
	
	The chauffeur gets back behind the wheel, adjusts the
	interior mirror so he can see himself, peels off his
	moustache, scratches his upper lip, refits the moustache more
	to his liking.
	
	INT. ATRIUM - DAY
	
	This building has a central atrium with corridors circling
	it, waist-high walls on the atrium side, glass-walled
	elevators rising up through the atrium. Myra and Hebbing are
	visible in an elevator coming up to a high floor. It stops
	and they exit, moving down the corridor.
	
	                    MYRA (V.O.)
	          When the oil money was good, they
	          put up all these office buildings,
	          and now they're half empty.
	
	INT. OFFICE - DAY
	
	ECU, translucent glass in door with company name: COE, STARK,
	FELLOWES & ASSOCIATES, STOCK BROKERAGE - London - New York -
	Dallas - Los Angeles - Tokyo. CAMERA PANS to follow Myra and
	Hebbing as they enter the office.
	
	AN ANGLE showing the well-furnished outer office, the
	attractive and competent RECEPTIONIST welcoming Myra as
	someone she knows, gesturing her through, Myra graciously
	accepting, moving on. Hebbing's impressed by everything,
	trying not to show it.
	
	                    MYRA  (V.O.)
	          They'll give you anything to move
	          in; first two months free,
	          redecoration, whatever you want.
	
	AN ANGLE in a clerical office, four CLERKS at well-equipped
	desks with computer terminals, hard at work.
	Maps and clocks on the walls indicate the world. Myra and
	Hebbing pass through.
	
	                    MYRA (V.O.)
	          They help you set up the store!
	
	AN ANGLE in the PRIVATE SECRETARY'S office, she on the phone,
	nodding and smiling at Myra and waving her through. Myra
	leads the way, opening a door marked HENRY FELLOWES, Partner.
	
	                    MYRA (V.O.)
	          I'm the roper, I go out and find
	          them and bring them in. Cole ran
	          the store, and he was the best.
	
	INT. COLE'S OFFICE - DAY
	
	Myra and Hebbing enter an office decorated with sleekly
	understated opulence; the view through large windows is of
	apparently-prosperous skyscrapers. Cole, a plausible rich
	businessman, happily greets Myra.
	
	                    COLE 
	          Mary Beth! As beautiful as ever.
	
	He lifts a dubious eyebrow toward Hebbing.
	
	                    COLE
	              (gentle disapproval)
	          I see you brought a friend.
	
	As Mary Beth, Myra has a faint southern-belle accent and a
	clinging flirtatiousness.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Mister Hebbing is my bodyguard, my
	          strong right arm. Gloucester
	          Hebbing, may I present my fine
	          stockbroker, Henry Fellowes.
	
	The men shake hands, Hebbing open and pleased and dignified,
	Cole clearly holding something back.
	
	                    COLE 
	              (to Myra; gentle warning) 
	          Mary Beth, what we have here, uh...
	
	                    MYRA
	              (gaily innocent)
	          Oh, I told Mister Hebbing all about
	          it, how brilliant you are at making
	          money for your special clients!
	
	                    COLE
	              (alarmed)
	          Mary Beth, I hope you aren't
	          spreading this good news too
	          widely.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Well, of course not! I know how
	          dangerous this is. But I would
	          trust Mister Hebbing with anything.
	              (to Hebbing; suggestive)
	          Wouldn't I, darling?
	
	While Hebbing looks manly and flustered and pleased, Cole
	brings from under his desk a partially full gray canvas sack
	marked Federal Reserve Bank.
	
	                    COLE 
	          Well, I'll have to take your word
	          for it, Mary Beth. Here's your
	          money.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (innocent avarice)
	          Goody!
	
	Myra opens her attache case on the desk. Cole takes banded
	stacks of bills from the sack, packs them neatly in the case.
	Hebbing tries not to look envious and impressed.
	
	HEBBING'S POV: The top bill in each stack is a hundred.
	
	PREVIOUS SHOT. Myra takes a stack, riffles it for Hebbing's
	benefit.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Isn't that just beautiful?
	
	                    HEBBING 
	          Yes, it is.
	
	Myra returns the stack to the case, talks to Cole.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Henry, next time, couldn't Mister
	          Hebbing --
	
	                    COLE
	              (shocked)
	          Mary Beth! This has never been
	          anything but --
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Oh, I know, I know, and you've been
	          wonderful since I was widowed. But
	          Mister Hebbing has--
	              (to Hebbing)
	          -- you don't mind my telling him,
	          darling --
	              (to Cole)
	          -- suffered reverses. If he
	          could...
	
	She gestures vaguely, unable to describe the situation
	accurately. Hebbing fills in, bluff and hearty.
	
	                    HEBBING 
	          Top up the tanks, as It were. Until
	          this little glitch in the oil
	          economy comes to an end.
	              (man to man laugh)
	          Not that I understand exactly what
	          you do, not from Mary Beth's
	          explanation.
	
	Cole broods, studying Hebbing, deciding at last to trust him.
	
	                    COLE
	          Well. If Mary Beth vouches for you,
	          and if she told you the story
	          already...
	
	                    MYRA
	              (girlish laugh)
	          So here we are!
	
	                    COLE
	              (solemn)
	          Mister Hebbing, we are talking
	          about breaking the law here, I want
	          to be sure you understand that. No
	          one gets hurt, but the law does get
	          broken.
	
	                    HEBBING
	              (a real sport; laughing)
	          Well, that's what the law's for,
	          isn't it?
	
	                    COLE
	              (still serious)
	          And I don't just mean the SEC. We
	          could have the FBI breathing down
	          our necks.
	
	                    HEBBING
	              (suddenly serious)
	          I certainly hope not.
	
	                    COLE 
	          Loose talk is the one thing I worry
	          about.
	
	                    HEBBING
	          I can keep my mouth shut, Mister
	          Fellowes.
	
	Describing the scheme, Cole becomes increasingly
	enthusiastic.
	
	                    COLE 
	          Okay, then. Sit down, sit down.
	
	Hebbing sits on the sofa, Myra beside him, holding his arm in
	both of hers. Cole paces, describing.
	
	                    COLE 
	          The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours
	          ahead of us, New York one hour
	          behind. There isn't one hour of the
	          day when both are open. Information
	          moves, but it has to wait. Now, we
	          have a young fellow working here --
	          Do you know what a hacker is,
	          Mister Hebbing?
	
	                    HEBBING
	          One of those computer geniuses,
	          isn't it?
	
	                    COLE
	          You're right! And this boy tapped
	          into that main link between Tokyo
	          and the New York Stock Exchange. He
	          can give us, when it's really
	          useful, a seven second delay in
	          that movement of information. Do
	          you know what that means?
	
	Hebbing doesn't want to admit ignorance.
	
	                    HEBBING 
	          Well, you've got your information
	          ahead of New York, I see that.
	
	                    COLE 
	          Every once in a while, a major
	          change comes through.
	          We have seven seconds to take
	          advantage, put our buy order, our
	          sell order, into the computer in
	          New York before the Tokyo data
	          comes in.
	
	                    HEBBING 
	          Not much time.
	
	                    COLE 
	          We have to be ready. We have to
	          have the money, and we have to know
	          what the information means, and we
	          have to move immediately.
	
	                    HEBBING 
	              (impressed)
	          Seven seconds. I don't see how you
	          do it.
	
	                    COLE 
	          These machines -- They're in here.
	
	Cole crosses to an inner door, pushes it partway open, looks
	back grinning with his hand on the knob.
	
	                    COLE 
	          Want a look?
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.
	
	INT. BARE ROOM - DAY
	
	A bare dusty room. A ladder leans against a wall, a paint can
	on the floor beside it. Only Cole is visible in the open
	doorway. He speaks back into the main office.
	
	                    COLE 
	          Come take a look. An entire-suite
	          of main-frame computer.
	
	                    MYRA (O.S.)
	          We're not really interested, Henry.
	
	INT. COLE'S OFFICE - DAY
	
	Cole remains in the doorway, luring Hebbing with a smile.
	
	                    COLE 
	          It's quite a sight. You sure?
	
	Cole's pushing this too far. Hebbing's thinking politeness
	requires him to look. Myra's nervous, her smile with an edge
	to it.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Henry, don't try Mister Hebbing's
	          patience. He knows what machines
	          look like.
	
	INT. BARE ROOM - DAY
	
	Cole smiles at the empty room again, looks back.
	
	                    COLE 
	          Well, if you're sure.
	
	He shuts the door.
	
	                    ROY (V.O.) 
	          Cole liked to take risks, huh?
	
	EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
	
	Roy and Myra at the table.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          He didn't think they were risks. He
	          was so good, Roy, he could just
	          play with the mark.
	
	                    ROY 
	          And when he got serious?
	
	                    MYRA 
	          He'd explain he had to have cash,
	          so there wouldn't be any paper
	          trail for the SEC. And a lot of
	          cash, or it wasn't worth while. The
	          least we ever took was forty
	          thousand, and the most was one
	          hundred eighty-five thousand
	          dollars! From one sucker!
	
	                    ROY 
	          I thought these people were broke.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They
	          had savings accounts, stocks to
	          sell, houses to mortgage. Sell
	          their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had
	          a lot of money, when they put their
	          minds to it.
	          Or when I put their minds to it. I
	          stayed with them, that's the
	          roper's job, made them get up every
	          penny they could raise, turn it all
	          over to Cole.
	
	                    ROY 
	          And a month later, the sucker calls
	          the cops and you're on the run.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          No no! He never calls the cops, not
	          after we give him the blow-off.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Yeah? How?
	
	INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
	
	Myra puts a blood-filled four-inch-square plastic package
	into her bra on the left side, then puts on a white blouse.
	
	                    MYRA  (V.O.)
	          Three or four days after Cole got
	          the money, he'd phone the sucker,
	          tell him he'd made the move.
	
	EXT. NEW BUILDING - DAY
	
	Myra and Hebbing hurry across the sidewalk from the limo,
	each carrying an attache case.
	
	                    MYRA (V.O.)
	          Our buy was in the computer, we
	          were rich, he should come collect.
	
	INT. COLE'S OFFICE - DAY
	
	Myra and Hebbing enter, Cole meets them, all happy.
	
	                    COLE 
	          Here you are! Two rich people!
	
	                    HEBBING
	          I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I
	          had moments I was worried.
	
	                    COLE
	          You brought a case? Good.
	
	Cole brings out the canvas sack from under the desk, reaches
	in, brings out a stack of bills. The door opens and two men
	in suits and topcoats and hats enter, one of them flashing a
	badge. (These are, altered, two of the clerks from before.)
	
	                    MAN
	          Hold it right there!
	
	                    COLE
	              (cool outrage)
	          What? This is a private office!
	
	                    MAN
	          FBI! Stock fraud, tampering with
	          Exchange communications --
	
	Cole suddenly loses all control, becomes a gibbering wreck.
	
	                    COLE
	          Oh, my God! No! The scandal!
	
	The second man approaches Hebbing, pencil and notebook at the
	ready, manner cold and tough.
	
	                    SECOND MAN
	          Your name?
	
	                    HEBBING
	          My --? I don't I only --
	
	                    COLE
	              (screams at Myra)
	          You! You and your goddamn big
	          mouth!
	
	                    KYRA
	              (terrified)
	          Henry, no, I --
	
	                    COLE
	          Who did you tell? Who?
	
	                    MYRA
	          Just one or two of the girls, just,
	          they wouldn't --
	
	Cole pulls a pistol from his desk drawer.
	
	                    COLE 
	          Don't move!
	
	                    MAN
	          Mister Fellowes, that isn't going
	          to do you any good. Put that down,
	          and --
	
	Cole ignores him, staring in frantic hatred at Myra.
	
	                    COLE 
	          You ruined me! You destroyed me!
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Henry, no!
	
	Cole shoots her, the SOUND very loud, the men flinching away.
	Myra slaps her hand to her breast; blood spurts between her
	fingers. In terror, she turns toward Hebbing, who stares at
	the blood seeping down her white blouse. She tries to speak,
	can't. She reaches out, her bloody hand sliding down
	Hebbing's front without getting any purchase, leaving a swath
	of blood diagonally across his jacket, shirt and tie. She
	topples forward. Hebbing tries to hold her, but she slips to
	the floor.
	
	Cole runs around the desk toward the door, waving the gun.
	
	                    COLE 
	          Get back! Get back!
	
	The men warily move away from the door.
	
	                    COLE 
	          I'll kill the first one that
	          follows me!
	
	Cole runs from the room. The two men pull guns from hip
	holsters under their coat-tails. Hebbing, kneeling beside
	Myra, watches them approach the door, crouch, run through.
	Hebbing rises, looks around, runs to the inner door, finds it
	locked. He crosses to the main door, looks out, cautiously
	creeps from the room.
	
	Myra sits up.
	
	INT. OFFICE - DAY
	
	Hebbing hurries through the empty secretary's office and out
	the other door. The two men enter from a different door and
	cross to re-enter Cole's office.
	
	INT. ATRIUM - DAY
	
	Cole stands behind a pillar, watching. Across the way,
	Hebbing comes out of the office, staring around, trying to
	wipe the blood from his clothes. In obvious panic, he runs to
	the elevator, presses the button.
	
	AN ANGLE through the glass wall into the elevator as it
	stops. The doors open, Hebbing hurries in, frantically jabs
	the button. The elevator descends. CAMERA PANS to Cole coming
	around the corridor, entering the office.
	
	INT. COLE'S OFFICE - DAY
	
	General hilarity. The secretary, two men, other two clerks,
	chauffeur and receptionist are all present, opening
	champagne, Hebbing's money now out of the sack and spread on
	the desk. Myra, stripped to the waist (unconcerned about the
	others present) cleans blood from her breasts with damp
	towels. He and Myra look at one another across the room,
	broadly smile.
	
	EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
	
	Myra's very up, from reliving this story.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Oh, Roy, it was great! We were
	          rolling in dough, lived wherever we
	          wanted, only pulled two or three
	          scams a year.
	
	                    ROY 
	          What happened to Cole?
	
	                    MYRA
	              (suddenly evasive)
	          He retired.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Where?
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Upstate.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Upstate where?
	
	                    MYRA
	          Atascadero.
	
	                    ROY 
	          That's where they keep the
	          criminally insane, isn't it?
	
	Myra turns her face away.
	
	INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
	
	Expensive room. Cole, naked, expression haunted and crazed,
	sits cross-legged on the bed. Myra enters, happy, carrying
	dress shop boxes. She stops, shocked, when she sees Cole.
	
	                    MYRA
	          No, baby. Not again.
	
	He stares at the floor over the edge of the bed, like a
	shipwreck victim in a raft looking at the sea.
	
	                    COLE
	          It's hollow. You'll fall through.
	
	Myra drops the packages on a chair.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?
	
	                    COLE 
	              (frightened but
	               determined)
	          Can't move.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          It's just the strain again, the
	          stress. We'll take a vacation.
	
	                    COLE
	          It's all hollow. Nothing behind it.
	
	She approaches him, scared but needing him.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Cole, you scare me when this
	          happens. One of these times...
	
	She touches him. He suddenly lashes out, knocking her
	backward, glaring at her.
	
	                    COLE 
	          Demon! Demon! That's why you can
	          walk on it! Demon!
	
	                    MYRA
	              (heartbroken)
	          Oh, Cole, please. Please come out
	          of it. What would I do without you?
	
	Distracted, gone, unaware of her existence, he gazes around,
	hugs himself, sits staring at demons. She watches him,
	mournful, knowing he's gone.
	
	EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
	
	Myra looks back at Roy. Her expression makes it clear she
	isn't going to tell him any more than she already has.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          He retired, and that's it. But I
	          didn't. I'm still the best long-con
	          roper you'll ever see.
	
	Roy laughs, genuinely pleased by her and also tacitly letting
	his questions drop.
	
	                    ROY 
	          I just bet you are, too. And now
	          you're trying to rope me.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (pushing enthusiasm)
	          Join up with you! I watched you,
	          Roy, I've been watching you,
	          wondering if I should talk about
	          this at all, or maybe just...
	              (shrug)
	
	                    ROY 
	          Take a hike, you mean?
	
	                    MYRA 
	          I need a partner, Roy. I need an
	          inside man, and you're it. You
	          could be as wonderful as Cole.
	
	                    ROY 
	              (dubious)
	          I don't know, Myra, I never had
	          partners. I never needed them.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Not to take soldiers for a hundred
	          bucks. But how about taking a bank
	          president for a hundred grand?
	
	Roy doesn't like this; he's feeling pressured. Myra sees it,
	but believes she's got him anyway, so she can let up. She
	pats his hand.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Think about it. Okay?
	
	                    ROY
	              (easy to promise)
	          Sure.
	
	INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
	
	A little drunk and happy, Roy and Myra come down the corridor
	together, then make it obvious they're going into separate
	rooms, across the corridor from one another.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (coy, sexy)
	          See you later.
	
	Roy complains, but half-heartedly, half humorously; this
	argument has already taken place.
	
	                    ROY 
	          I still don't see why we have to
	          have separate rooms. You expect
	          your father to come through?
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Separate bathrooms, darling. I will
	          not lay out all my cosmetics for
	          you to knock over.
	
	                    ROY
	              (nevertheless grumpy)
	          Things a man isn't supposed to
	          know.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (soothing)
	          You don't mind, really, do you,
	          Roy? It's been such a wonderful
	          evening, I guess I just wore myself
	          out.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Sure. I'm pretty tired myself.
	
	They unlock the opposing doors, look back at one another.
	Myra's smile and good-night wave are consciously cute. Roy's
	response is a little forced. They go into their rooms.
	
	INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Once he's alone, Roy stops trying to look like a good sport.
	Disgusted, he tosses the room key onto the dresser, then
	crosses to sliding glass doors closed in front of a balcony.
	He's about to close the drapes when he looks out, changes his
	mind, unlocks and opens the door. He steps outside.
	
	EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT
	
	A high floor, with a wide view of ocean and starry sky. Roy
	leans on the rail, looking out, thinking. He mutters to
	himself.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Long con. I'm the one's been
	          conned. Who needs this?
	
	He continues to stand there, taking some solace from the
	night. BEAT. Phone RINGS. Confused, irritated, he turns to
	look into the room. Phone RINGS. At last, he goes back into
	the room.
	
	INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Roy crosses to pick up the phone, grumpy and suspicious.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Yeah?
	
	                    MYRA (V.O.)
	              (filtered)
	          Open your door.
	
	                    ROY 
	          What?
	              (grins; gets it)
	          What for?
	
	                    MYRA (V.O.) 
	              (filtered)
	          Open it and find out.
	
	Roy hangs up and crosses to the door.
	
	AN ANGLE directly at the door as Roy opens it, showing Myra's
	door open across the way, Myra standing in her doorway naked.
	She waves at him to move over.
	
	                    MYRA (CONT'D)
	          Gangway!
	
	Roy steps back, holding his door open.
	
	INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
	
	AN ANGLE down the hall as Myra skips across from her room to
	Roy's, her door slamming behind her.
	
	INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Myra runs in, giggling. Roy shuts the door, laughing at her.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (coquettish)
	          I hope you don't mind, sir. I just
	          washed my clothes, and I couldn't
	          do a thing with them.
	
	Roy's pleased, but at a loss.
	
	                    ROY 
	          You -- I don't know.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (sudden burst of laughter)
	               )
	          If you could have seen your face
	          when I told you good night! You
	          looked so, so... Ah!
	
	                    ROY 
	          Oh, come here.
	
	They embrace.
	
	INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
	
	A clean anonymous Holiday Inn. Lilly, dressed for the track,
	sits at the round table under the swag light, sorting through
	her business purse. There's a folded newspaper on the table.
	KNOCK on the door. She's startled. For just a second, she's
	like a trapped animal. Then she's calm again. She turns the
	purse around, opens another zipper section, removes a pistol
	and a silencer, quickly screws the silencer onto the pistol,
	lays the pistol on the table and covers it with the
	newspaper. Then she crosses to open the door.
	
	AN ANGLE to include Roy in the doorway, grinning, easy.
	Lilly's surprised, pleased, but wary.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Roy! What are you doing in San
	          Diego?
	
	                    ROY
	              (entering)
	          Myra and me come down to LaJolla
	          for the weekend.
	
	Lilly makes a face, but no comment, at Myra's name, as she
	closes the door.
	
	                    LILLY
	          If you come out to the track, don't
	          know me.
	
	                    ROY
	          We won't hit the track. The beach.
	          Couple a nice restaurants.
	
	He takes from his pockets the wads of money held removed from
	the clown pictures, extends them toward her.
	
	                    LILLY
	          What's that?
	
	                    ROY
	          Four grand. For the hospital. Is
	          that enough?
	
	                    LILLY
	              (distressed)
	          Roy, I don't want money from you.
	
	                    ROY
	          I pay my debts.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (level skeptical look)
	          You do?
	
	Since she won't take the money, he turns to put it on the
	table beside her purse, pushing the newspaper out of the way,
	revealing the gun. He gives it a surprised smile.
	
	                    ROY
	          Expecting visitors?
	
	                    LILLY
	          No. That was the point.
	
	She crosses to unscrew the silencer and put both pieces back
	in her purse. Roy, watching, points at the still angry burn
	on her hand.
	
	                    ROY 
	          You ought to put a bandage on that.
	
	                    LILLY
	          No can do. Have to dip in and out
	          of my bag too much. Besides, it'll
	          heal in the air.
	
	Disdainful and hurt, she pushes at the wads of money.
	
	                    LILLY (CONT'D)
	          Roy, take that back.
	
	His own hostility shows through.
	
	                    ROY 
	          No.
	
	She's not used to being vulnerable, can neither hide it nor
	really express it; can't use it as a tactic.
	
	                    LILLY
	          I thought... I was hoping we could
	          play it straight with one another.
	
	                    ROY 
	          I guess not. You'll be heading east
	          from here, huh?
	
	                    LILLY 
	              (dull)
	          After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Well... nice to see you again,
	          Lilly.
	
	                    LILLY
	          You, too, Roy.
	
	Roy finds this parting unsatisfactory, but has nothing to
	add. With a shrug, he leaves. Lilly looks after him, her
	expression becoming resentful, dully angry.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Prick.
	
	EXT. HOLIDAY INN - DAY
	
	Myra sits in the back seat of a taxi parked across the street
	from the motel. The door to Lilly's room is visible in b.g.
	Roy walks toward the street from Lilly's room.
	
	                    DRIVER
	          Here he comes.
	
	                    MYRA
	          I see him.
	
	Reaching the sidewalk, Roy turns to an empty cab parked on
	that side of the street, in front of the motel. Myra's driver
	shifts into gear.
	
	                    MYRA (CONT'D)
	          Wait. Hold it.
	
	                    DRIVER
	          That's the guy we're following.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Just wait.
	
	Roy enters the other cab, which drives away, as Lilly comes
	out of her room in b.g.
	
	                    MYRA (CONT'D)
	          Ah.
	
	Lilly gets into her Chrysler, backs away from the slot,
	drives to the street.
	
	                    MYRA (CONT'D)
	          Now we follow her.
	
	                    DRIVER
	          You're the boss.
	
	AN ANGLE on the two vehicles, as they leave the motel.
	
	EXT. DELMAR - DAY
	
	Where the surf meets the turf. Over the punters' heads, out
	beyond the track, spreads the Pacific Ocean, unnoticed,
	ignored. In every shot in this sequence, the ocean is visible
	but not looked at.
	
	AN ANGLE on Lilly, with her heavy shoulderbag, moving along
	empty tables, here and there picking up used tickets.
	
	AN ANGLE on Myra, on a different level, watching Lilly.
	
	AN ANGLE on Lilly at the betting windows.
	
	AN ANGLE on Myra, on a high vantage point in the stands. A
	MAN near her watches the field through binoculars. Myra ASKS
	if she can borrow them for a minute. Men are always happy to
	do Myra favors; the man gives her the binoculars. She looks
	at the field briefly, then turns and looks through the
	binoculars the other way, outside the track. The man,
	surprised, looks the same way.
	
	MAN'S POV: The parking area.
	
	PREVIOUS SHOT. The man looks in curiosity at Myra, who
	concentrates, adjusting the focus.
	
	MYRA'S POV: Foreshortened through the binoculars, Lilly opens
	the Chrysler's trunk, stashes money.
	
	PREVIOUS SHOT. Myra smiles, turns it into a sweet thank-you
	smile as she returns the binoculars to their owner.
	
	EXT. HOTEL POOL - DAY
	
	Roy dives into the pool, swims underwater to the ladder,
	climbs out near a YOUNG BLONDE on a chaise longue, who's been
	admiring him.
	
	                    BLONDE
	          You stay down real good.
	
	                    ROY
	          One of my talents.
	
	                    BLONDE 
	              (pointing upward)
	          Your mother's calling.
	
	Roy looks up.
	
	AN ANGLE to show Myra waving from her balcony, four flights
	up.
	
	PREVIOUS SHOT. Roy's at first surprised, then amused by the
	blonde.
	
	                    ROY
	          Naughty.
	
	He gathers up his towel and heads for the building.
	
	INT. BATHROOM - DAY
	
	Roy stands in heavy spray in the shower, half asleep, gently
	touching his stomach where the bruise used to be. KNOCK on
	door. He ignores it.
	
	                    MYRA (O.S.)
	          Roy! You drown in there?
	
	He rouses himself.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Be right out!
	
	INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
	
	Myra moves away from the bathroom door. She's in a bad mood.
	She paces back and forth, out onto the balcony, then back
	into the room as Roy comes out of the bathroom wearing a
	towel.
	
	                    ROY
	          You were gone for a while.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (casual)
	          I went out to Delmar.
	
	                    ROY
	              (suddenly wary) )
	          The track? Did you run into Lilly?
	
	                    MYRA 
	          I saw her.
	
	                    ROY
	          She didn't see you, in other words.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          I'm not trying to make trouble,
	          Roy. It's just, she's always so
	          nasty to me, I thought, who is she
	          to be so high and mighty. I saw her
	          out there, and I called a friend of
	          mine in Baltimore, so now I know
	          who she is.
	
	                    ROY
	              (dry)
	          You must have some very
	          knowledgeable friends.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          I'm well connected, Roy, Cole
	          introduced me to a lot of people.
	          Very valuable. Valuable for us.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Running your broker scam, you mean.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (enthusiastic)
	          You and me, Roy. What a team we'll
	          make. We think alike; we get along
	          together.
	          Once or twice a year we take some
	          slob, the rest of the time we live
	          like this. You won't regret this,
	          Roy.
	
	                    ROY
	          Regret what? I didn't say I was
	          coming aboard.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          But why not? I thought it was
	          settled. What's holding you back?
	
	                    ROY 
	          Come on, Myra, don't talk business
	          here. This is time out.
	
	She considers him.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          You mean, it would be too tough to
	          give me a turndown here. Easier on
	          home grounds.
	
	                    ROY
	              (shrug)
	          Yes or no. They're both easier at
	          home. Okay?
	
	Myra makes a visible effort to be accommodating.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Whatever you say, darling.
	
	INT. KAGGS' OFFICE - DAY
	
	Kaggs sits at his computer terminal, bringing up data, not
	pleased by what he sees. Buzzer SOUNDS. He swivels to the
	desk, presses the intercom button.
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          Yeah?
	
	                    RECEPTIONIST (V.O.)
	          Roy Dillon, Mr. Kaggs.
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          Good! Send him in.
	
	With a now-we're-getting-somewhere manner, Kaggs turns back
	to the VDT, punches up a different set of data, sits looking
	at it in gloomy satisfaction. Roy enters, and Kaggs rises,
	extending his hand across the desk. They shake hands.
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          Good to have you back, Roy. I was
	          just looking at --
	
	                    ROY 
	          Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.
	
	                    KAGGS 
	              (keen)
	          You're turning me down? Makes no
	          sense, Roy.
	
	                    ROY 
	          I guess I'm just not a leader of
	          men.
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          Oh, come on, Roy.
	
	                    ROY 
	          The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          Perk, remember?
	
	                    ROY 
	          Okay, fine. Perk, the truth is, I
	          like things the way they are now.
	          Pick my own hours, have time for,
	          uh, other activities...
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          A well-rounded life. I respect
	          that. But it has to have a center,
	          Roy, something you care about,
	          something you can think about.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Maybe I'm just not ready for that
	          yet.
	
	                    KAGGS
	              (deep sigh)
	          Well, Roy, if that's the way you
	          feel, I won't badger you.
	              (forced laugh)
	          Don't want to lose you as a
	          salesman, too.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Oh, I'd like to stay on. Just keep
	          everything the way it was.
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          That's what we'll do, then. But I
	          tell you what, Roy. Before I hire
	          anybody else, I'll ask you one last
	          time. Fair enough?
	
	                    ROY 
	          Fair enough.
	
	They shake hands.
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
	
	Roy's room. He has one of the clown pictures face down on the
	coffee table. He takes money from his jacket pockets, crams
	it into the space, which is now just about full. As he's
	tightening the wing nuts closing the back, doorbell RINGS. He
	hurries, finishing the job, hanging the picture on the wall,
	then crossing to open the door. Myra enters, ebullient.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Darling, guess what? I had to tell
	          you right away.
	
	She gives him an enthusiastic kiss, then marches into the
	living room.
	
	                    ROY 
	              (grinning)
	          And hello to you, too.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          I called a fellow I know in Tulsa,
	          the one who plays my chauffeur.
	          There's a sucker there he says is
	          made for us. And a boroker that
	          just shut down, we can use their
	          office, not change a thing! Now, I
	          can scrape up ten grand without
	          much trouble. That leaves fifteen
	          or twenty for your end. We could
	          start this weekend, get the sucker
	          into position --
	
	                    ROY 
	          Wait a minute! When did this
	          happen, that we're partners?
	
	                    MYRA 
	              (bewildered)
	          What?
	
	                    ROY 
	          The last I looked, we were just
	          talking things over.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          But the setup's there. It's there
	          now.
	
	                    ROY 
	          I don't think I need it.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          You're too good for the small-time,
	          Roy. Move up to where there's big
	          dough to be made, and you don't
	          have to stick your neck out every
	          day.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Maybe I like it where I am.
	
	Myra's need breaks through her good sense.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Well, maybe I don't! I had ten good
	          years with Cole, and I want them
	          back! I gotta have a partner! I
	          looked and I looked and believe me,
	          brother, I kissed a lot of fucking
	          frogs, and you're my prince!
	
	Roy tries to treat this lightly.
	
	                    ROY
	          Don't I get any say in this?
	
	                    MYRA 
	          No! Because I --
	
	                    ROY
	              (pointing at her)
	          That's what I say.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (thrown off course)
	          What?
	
	                    ROY 
	          What I say is, no. We don't do
	          partners.
	
	                    MYRA (CONT'D)
	              (raging)
	          For Christ's sake, why not?
	
	                    ROY 
	          Mostly, because you scare the shit
	          out of me. I've seen people like
	          you before, baby. Double-tough and
	          sharp as they come, and you get
	          what you want or else. But you
	          don't make it work forever.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Bullshit!
	
	                    ROY 
	          No; history. Sooner or later, the
	          lightning hits. I don't want to be
	          around when it hits you.
	
	She stares at him, trying to find a chink in the armor,
	trying to find a reason, trying to find something.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          What is it? What's going on?
	
	                    ROY 
	          I'm happy the way I am.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          By God, it's your mother. It's
	          Lilly.
	
	                    ROY
	              (doesn't get it) )
	          What?
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Sure it is. That's why you act so
	          funny around each other.
	
	He frowns at her, not believing he understands her right.
	
	                    ROY 
	          What's that?
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Don't act so goddamned innocent!
	          You and your own mother, gah! You
	          like to go back where you been,
	          huh?
	
	He takes a step toward her, rising toward fury.
	
	                    ROY 
	          You watch that mouth.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          I'm wise to you, I should have seen
	          it before, you rotten son of a
	          bitch. How is it, huh? How do you
	          like --
	
	He slaps her openhanded but hard, and she staggers back. He
	pursues her.
	
	                    ROY 
	          How do you like this?
	
	He slaps her as hard with the other hand. Astonished,
	frightened, befuddled, she backpedals, bringing her forearms
	up to protect her face. He grabs her two wrists in one hand,
	holds them out of the way, slaps her forehand and backhand,
	forehand and backhand.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          STOP!!
	
	He suddenly gets control of himself, releases her, steps back
	into the middle of the room. He's angry, but also remorseful,
	sorry he lost control but still enraged at the enormity of
	her suggestion.
	
	                    ROY 
	          That's not like me. I don't do
	          violence.
	
	She cowers against the wall, peering in terror at him through
	her raised arms. He settles down, becomes heavily calm.
	
	                    ROY 
	          That's why we wouldn't work
	          together. You're disgusting. Your
	          mind's so filthy, it's hard even to
	          look at you.
	
	He crosses to the apartment door, pulls it open. Sunlight
	pours in.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Goodbye, Myra.
	
	She lowers her arms slowly, as though her whole body aches.
	She's still scared, but angry now, too. She'd like to tell
	him off, but discretion tells her not to. She moves across
	the room toward the open door, but stops, not wanting to be
	that close to him.
	Understanding, he backs away from the doorway, gestures with
	cold irony for her to proceed. She moves to the threshold,
	looks back at him.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          And you don't even know it.
	
	Angry again, Roy steps forward. She hastily steps outside,
	and he slams the door.
	
	EXT. ROY'S APARTMENT - DAY
	
	Myra moves slowly along the balcony, muttering to herself.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Mama. It's Mama. She's the one.
	
	She stops, holding the balcony rail, looking out at the city.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          You'll get yours, Mama. Oh, yes.
	
	INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
	
	Lilly's room; empty. Phone RINGS. Lilly enters, tired, with
	her shoulderbag; the end of her work day. Phone RINGS. She
	frowns at it, expecting nothing good, then drops the
	shoulderbag on the bed, crosses, answers.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Yes?
	
	A sudden smile doesn't entirely hide the wariness.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Roy! An unexpected pleasure.
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
	
	Roy, troubled, paces while talking on the phone.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Lilly, I've got a couple things to
	          think about. Well, kind of job
	          offers, kind of. Different ways to
	          go. I'd kind of like to talk them
	          out, you know? Maybe just hear
	          myself talk.
	
	INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
	
	Lilly's delighted, but can't trust this moment more than any
	other.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Well, sure, Roy. You want me to
	          drive up --? Okay, fine, come on
	          down.
	              (kidding)
	          It won't be a home-cooked meal, you
	          know.

	              (kidding)
	          Well, that's good news.
	
	He hangs up, but he's nervous, still uncertain, pacing.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Well? Who's a boy gonna talk to, if
	          not his mother?
	
	The sound of the question makes him laugh.
	
	EXT. MOTEL - DAY
	
	Myra's Cadillac eases to a stop across the street, where she
	earlier waited in the cab.
	
	AN ANGLE through the windshield at Myra, settling down to
	wait, looking at the motel.
	
	INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Lilly comes out of the bathroom, putting her lipstick away in
	a small purse. She's dressed carefully for tonight; upscale
	and respectable, without being stodgy. She crosses to the
	window -- night view outside -- and as she pulls the drapes
	shut the phone RINGS. She looks at it in disappointment,
	crosses to answer.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (expecting rejection)
	          Roy?
	
	INT. OFFICE - NIGHT
	
	Irv the accountant's office in Baltimore. He looks secretive
	and scared, talks in a hush.
	
	                    IRV 
	          Lilly, listen, it's Irv. You were
	          always decent with me, I'm taking a
	          hell of a chance here.
	          Somebody blew you out with Bobo.
	          The car full of money. He's --
	          Lilly?
	
	INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Empty. The phone receiver dangles off the table on its cord.
	The door finishes closing.
	
	EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT
	
	Lilly's Chrysler jounces out to the street, moving too fast,
	making the turn, racing away. CAMERA PANS to Myra's Cadillac,
	pulling away from the curb, following. CAMERA HOLDS with the
	two cars receding in b.g.
	
	INT. HONDA - NIGHT 
	
	Roy drives down a San Diego street, is stopped by a red
	light, looks at his watch. He's late.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Damn.
	
	INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Empty; as before. The door opens and the two thugs we saw
	earlier with Bobo enter, one putting a thick ring of keys
	away in his jacket pocket. They close the door, look around
	the room. One goes to the closet, opens it, looks at the
	clothing inside, while the other goes into the bathroom. The
	first crosses to the dresser, pulls open a drawer full of
	clothing. The second comes out of the bathroom. They look at
	one another. The guy from the bathroom shakes his head. The
	other one points at the dangling phone, speaks.
	
	                    THUG
	          Somebody spooked her.

	          Full of cash.
	
	They leave the room.
	
	EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT
	
	Roy walks toward Lilly's room as the two thugs pass him, on
	their way out. Roy knocks on Lilly's door, waits, knocks
	again.
	He tries to look through a crack in the drapes into the room,
	then turns to look at the empty place where Lilly's Chrysler
	had been. He shakes his head, knocks once more, looks at his
	watch, turns away.
	
	                    ROY
	              (disgusted)
	          Thanks a lot, Lilly.
	
	He walks off.
	
	EXT. ARIZONA MOTEL - NIGHT
	
	Lilly's white Chrysler pulls off the road into the front
	parking area of a new small motel. The car brakes to a stop.
	
	AN ANGLE from the road as Myra's blue Cadillac drives slowly
	by, while, in b.g., Lilly gets out of the Chrysler, moving as
	though she's stiff and tired. Lilly enters the motel office.
	
	INT. MOTEL OFFICE - NIGHT
	
	The CLERK, an elderly woman, turns away from a small TV set
	when Lilly enters.
	
	                    CLERK
	          Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Good evening. I'd like a single for
	          tonight.
	
	                    CLERK 
	          Oh, everything's the same size,
	          same price.
	
	The clerk extends a registration card and pen to Lilly, who
	takes them but doesn't yet start to write.
	
	                    LILLY
	          I'm a very light sleeper, traffic
	          noise keeps me wide awake all
	          night.
	
	                    CLERK
	              (sympathetic)
	          Those trucks. I know exactly what
	          you mean.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Do you have something around back,
	          facing away from the road?
	
	The clerk turns to consider the key rack.
	
	                    CLERK
	          I'll put you in one thirty-one.
	          Very quiet. Faces the desert.

	          Sounds perfect. I can park my car
	          back there?

	          Right in front of the room.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Fine.
	
	She starts to fill in the registration card.
	
	                    LILLY
	          And I'll want to leave an early
	          wake-up call.
	
	                    CLERK 
	          No problem. My husband gets up the
	          crack of dawn.
	              (confidential)
	          It's his kidneys.

	fifty yards short of the motel.
	
	INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
	
	Over Myra's shoulder as she watches, through the windshield,
	the Chrysler parked in front of the motel. Lilly comes out of
	the office over there, gets into the Chrysler, backs it up,
	drives it out of sight past the motel. Myra puts the Cadillac
	in gear.
	
	INT. ROOM 131 - NIGHT
	
	A clean anonymous motel room, with two beds. Lilly enters,
	very weary, puts her shoulderbag on one of the beds, goes
	back outside and leaves the door open. She has backed the
	Chrysler into its spot just outside her room, so its trunk is
	visible through the open doorway.
	
	EXT. ARIZONA MOTEL - NIGHT
	
	AN ANGLE on Lilly as she opens the rear door of the Chrysler
	and leans in.
	
	INT. CHRYSLER - MIGHT
	
	Lilly wrestles the rear seat out of position, reaches down
	into the space under and behind it, and brings out a soft
	cloth overnight bag. It seems not too full but fairly heavy.
	She puts the bag on the ground outside the car and then
	pushes and prods the seat back into position.
	
	EXT. ARIZONA MOTEL - NIGHT
	
	Lilly shuts the car door, picks up the bag, and enters her
	room, shutting the door behind her.
	
	INT. MOTEL OFFICE - NIGHT
	
	Myra enters. The clerk looks at her in surprise.
	
	                    CLERK 
	          Something wrong?
	              (embarrassed)
	          I'm sorry. I thought you were the
	          other lady.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          No. I'm me.
	
	INT. ROOM 231 - NIGHT
	
	Lilly puts the bag on the bed with her shoulderbag. She opens
	the overnight bag, takes from it a blond wig, a pair of horn
	rim glasses and a passport. From her shoulderbag she takes
	the pistol and silencer. She attaches the silencer to the
	pistol and puts the pistol under the pillow of the other bed.
	
	INT. MOTEL OFFICE - NIGHT
	
	Myra's checking in. She fills in the registration card while
	the clerk considers her key rack.
	
	                    CLERK 
	          I'll give you one oh seven. That's
	          a very nice room, very handy, in
	          the front, right by the pool.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Oh, don't you have something around
	          back, where it's quieter?
	
	The clerk sighs, looks at the key she'd taken from the rack,
	reluctantly goes back to consider the situation again.
	
	                    CLERK 
	          Everybody wants the back tonight.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          I guess everybody wants privacy.
	
	INT. ROOM 131 - NIGHT
	
	Lilly, in nightgown, yawning, comes out of the bathroom,
	switching off its light. The shoulderbag and overnight bag
	and overnight bag's contents are still on one bed. Lilly gets
	into the other, switches off the light.
	
	INT. ROOM 119 - NIGHT
	
	Virtually identical to Room 131. Myra enters, lugging a
	suitcase, and shuts the door behind herself. She puts the
	suitcase on one of the beds, opens it, paws through it, and
	brings out slippers, nightgown and robe. Briskly, she strips
	and puts on the nightgown, the slippers and the robe.
	
	Back into the suitcase, she brings out a small snubnose
	pistol which she puts in the pocket of her robe. Next out of
	the suitcase is a large ring of keys.
	
	Sitting on the other bed, she compares her room key with keys
	on the ring, takes three keys from the ring, and puts them in
	her robe pocket along with the room key.
	
	Getting to her feet, she crosses to the dresser, picks up the
	ice bucket, and leaves the room, closing the door behind
	herself.
	
	EXT. ROOM 131 - NIGHT
	
	CU, the door, with its number. CAMERA PANS to pick up Myra,
	approaching. She stops at room 132, looks at the Chrysler,
	smiles at it in proprietary fashion, and pats the Chrysler on
	the trunk.
	
	Then she turns to the room. She takes the keys from her
	pocket, looks around to be sure she's alone, and bends over
	the lock.
	
	INT. ROOM 131 - NIGHT
	
	In very dim light, Myra enters the room, closes the door,
	moves toward the beds. CAMERA PANS with her. Keeping her eyes
	on the sleeping form of Lilly, she puts the empty ice bucket
	on the empty bed, then moves closer to Lilly. CAMERA PANS in,
	moving forward as Myra's arms move forward, moving to CU on
	Lilly as Myra's hands (remaining IN FRAME) move forward and
	down. Her hands abruptly clamp on Lilly's throat. QUICK CUT.

	                    ROY 
	          Thank you.
	
	INT. POLICE CAR - DAY
	
	The uniformed cop drives. Pierson and Roy sit in back.
	
	                    PIERSON 
	          I realize this is a shock.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
	
	                    PIERSON 
	          That's natural.
	
	                    ROY 
	          No. I mean, I don't believe it.
	          Lilly is not a suicide. I know my
	          mother, nothing would make her
	          check out.
	
	                    PIERSON 
	          I'm sorry, it was her all right.
	          Her gun, even.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Gun?
	
	                    PIERSON 
	          I grant you, it's a little odd,
	          shoot yourself with a gun with a
	          silencer on it, but it was hers,
	          all right. It really is your
	          mother, Mister Dillon.
	
	                    ROY 
	          It may be Lilly, but it isn't
	          suicide.
	
	                    PIERSON 
	              (interested)
	          Do you have any particular reason
	          to say that?
	
	                    ROY 
	          My mother... Well, I guess it
	          doesn't matter now. She worked for
	          gamblers. She always knew they
	          might turn on her some day.
	
	                    PIERSON
	              (thoughtful)
	          A hit, you mean. Honestly, it
	          doesn't have that feel to it, but
	          I'll certainly consider the
	          possibility. Thank you for telling
	          me.
	
	The car stops.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Not that it matters.
	              (looks out)
	          This is the morgue?
	
	                    PIERSON 
	          You up to it now?
	
	                    ROY 
	          Sure. Let's get it over.
	
	                    PIERSON 
	          One thing I have to caution you
	          about. A gunshot wound...
	
	                    ROY
	              (impatient)
	          Yes, I know, I know.
	
	                    PIERSON
	              (reluctant)
	          Well, uh, you know, she ate the
	          gun.
	
	                    ROY
	              (not understanding)
	          What?
	
	                    PIERSON 
	          I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate
	          phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to
	          tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon,
	          this isn't an everyday occurrence
	          around here.
	
	                    ROY
	              (low; getting it)
	          Ate the gun. Oh.
	
	                    PIERSON 
	          Someone who knows her well could
	          still identify her, that's not the
	          problem. It's just there's, uh,
	          it's likely to be a shock.
	
	                    ROY
	              (opening the door)
	          Well, let's get the shock over
	          with.
	
	INT. MORGUE VIEWING ROOM - DAY
	
	A bare bright room with tiled walls, a few plastic chairs, an
	ordinary office door on one side and wide hospital swinging
	doors on the other. Pierson and Roy stand watching.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Not many laughs in this room, eh?
	
	                    PIERSON 
	          Not many.
	
	The swinging doors open and an ATTENDANT wheels in a gurney
	containing a body covered by a sheet. Roy braces himself. The
	attendant pulls the sheet away from the face.
	
	                    PIERSON (CONT'D)
	              (to the attendant)
	          Remove that. We'll want a full, uh,
	          identification.
	
	The attendant removes the sheet. The body wears a nightgown.
	
	AN ANGLE on Roy, swallowing bile, as he forces himself to
	move forward and look down at the face. He immediately looks
	away again.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Oh, Jesus.
	
	                    PIERSON 
	          No question, huh?
	
	                    ROY 
	          No, its -- Why did she--?
	
	He forces himself to look at the body again, his own face
	full of the unanswerable question. He looks her up and down,
	then his eyes stop. He focuses on something, a look of
	surprise coming into his eyes.
	
	Roy's POV: CU, the body's hands, crossed over the stomach,
	the wrists crossed, the palms down, the clear backs of both
	hands visible.
	
	CU, Roy. He knows. Sharpness comes back into his expression.
	
	                    PIERSON  (O.S.)
	          That's that, then.
	
	                    ROY
	              (starting to grin)
	          Oh, yeah. That's that.
	
	TWO SHOT, Roy and Pierson. Pierson wants to leave, but Roy
	stands over the gurney. He chuckles. Pierson looks at him,
	surprised and appalled. Roy ignores him.
	
	                    ROY (CONT'D)
	              (laughing quietly)
	          Mom.
	
	QUICK CUT.
	
	EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY
	
	MONTAGE. Myra's baby blue Cadillac drives, at extreme high
	speed, alone on the highway.
	
	EXT. MADERO APARTMENTS - NIGHT
	
	Myra's Cadillac drives slowly past, comes to a stop at the
	curb half a block away.
	
	INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
	
	AN ANGLE through the windshield at the driver, a woman,
	deeply weary. Her forearms are crossed on top of the steering
	wheel, her brow resting on the forearms. The burn on the back
	of her right hand is visible in illumination from a nearby
	streetlight. Traffic goes by. BEAT. Lilly lifts her head,
	looking out at the night. She's very tired, but determined.
	
	AN ANGLE beside Lilly, inside the car. From the seat beside
	her she picks up Myra's large dangly earrings and fixes them
	in place. Then she puts on Myra's big-lensed dark sunglasses.
	(She's wearing the clothes Myra wore when checking into the
	motel.) Lilly checks her appearance in the rearview mirror,
	then gets out of the car.
	
	INT. MADERO LOBBY - NIGHT
	
	AN ANGLE on Simms at the desk, talking to a TELEPHONE
	REPAIRMAN steadily at work fixing the switchboard.
	
	                    SIMMS
	          The last modern thing I liked was
	          the miniskirt. Your technology,
	          now, nobody understands it, and
	          that's the simple fact of the
	          situation.
	
	Lilly enters in b.g., crosses to the elevator, presses the
	button. Simms waves to her.
	
	                    SIMMS
	              (calling) )
	          Evening, Mizz Langley!
	
	The elevator door opens, Lilly boards and presses the button.
	The elevator door closes.
	
	                    SIMMS
	          New things come in here all the
	          time, how do they work? You can ask
	          your Ph.Ds, your highly educated,
	          intelligent, professional people,
	          you can say to them, how does that
	          work, and you know what they'll
	          tell you? You plug it in. And
	          that's the way the donut dunks.
	
	EXT. MADERO APARTMENTS BALCONY - NIGHT
	
	The balcony leading to Roy's apartment. It's illuminated by a
	light next to the public door from the interior hall.
	AN ANGLE on that door as Lilly cautiously opens it, looks out
	and around while remaining mostly behind the door, then
	focuses on the light. She reaches out and unscrews the bulb.
	GO TO BLACK.
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Roy's place. Dark. SOUNDS of lock being picked. The door
	opens, showing only blackness outside, Lilly enters and shuts
	the door, then switches on the main light.
	
	Ah ANGLE on Lilly, in the middle of the room, distractedly
	biting her thumbnail as she looks around, calculating. She
	looks directly at something.
	
	Lilly's POV: One of the box-framed pictures hanging on the
	wall.
	
	PREVIOUS SHOT. Lilly, making up her mind, crosses to the
	picture and takes it off the wall. She finds it surprisingly
	heavy. She carries it to the coffee table, puts it down there
	on its back, sits on the sofa.
	
	AN ANGLE on Lilly studying the picture. She raps her knuckle
	against the sides, looks to see if the front or sides open
	someway, and finally turns the picture over, laying it face
	down on the coffee table. She sees how to remove the back,
	lifts it off, and looks at the stacks of money lying in
	there.
	
	CU, Lilly, almost fainting with relief.
	
	WIDE SHOT. Lilly looks at the other picture, looks again at
	the money, comes to a conclusion. She rises and leaves the
	room, deeper into the apartment.
	
	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Lilly switches on the light as she enters the room. She looks
	around, crosses to the closet, goes through the stuff in
	there, finds an old attache case on the shelf. She brings it
	out, puts it on the bed, opens it. Inside are a few decks of
	cards and a paperback book. She tosses them onto the bed,
	checks the case, finds that one of the clasps works but the
	other doesn't. One is good enough. She carries the attache
	case out of the room, leaving the light on.
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Lilly enters, puts the case on the coffee table beside the
	picture, scoops the money out of the picture and puts it in
	the case. Then she unceremoniously dumps the picture on the
	floor.
	
	Lilly takes the second picture from the wall, puts it face
	down on the coffee table, opens the back, transfers the money
	to the case. She closes the case, attaches the one clasp that
	works, picks up the case.
	
	                    ROY (O.S.)
	          Hello, Lilly.
	
	TWO SHOT, as Lilly whirls around, terrified and then
	relieved. Roy stands in the open apartment doorway, blackness
	behind him.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Oh! Roy! You scared me.
	
	Roy enters the room and shuts the door.
	
	                    ROY
	          Going somewhere?
	
	                    LILLY
	          Somewhere else, that's for sure.
	
	                    ROY
	          I just came back from Phoenix.
	
	                    LILLY 
	              (anxious)
	          Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
	
	                    ROY
	          Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down.
	          Take a minute, tell me about it.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          I've really got to --
	
	                    ROY
	          You're dead, Lilly, it worked.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Not for long. Not when they do a
	          fingerprint check.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Why should they? The cops are
	          satisfied.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Bobo won't be. He'll spend the
	          money to make sure.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Even so. You still got time. Relax
	          a minute, tell me what happened.
	          Sit down.
	
	He gestures at the sofa. Lilly's holding the attache case.
	The gutted pictures are lying around, one on the coffee table
	and one on the floor. She looks around at everything, awkward
	and embarrassed. But Roy hasn't said anything. And he's
	between her and the door.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Just for a minute.
	
	She backs up, sits on the sofa, puts the case on her lap. Roy
	pulls a chair over so it's directly between Lilly and the
	door. He sits, looking at her with polite interest.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Myra followed you, huh?
	
	                    LILLY
	          She must have been the one that
	          blew me off with Bobo. I guess to
	          get me running. Did you tell her
	          about my stash?
	
	                    ROY
	              (isn't worth discussing)
	          No.
	
	                    LILLY
	          No, you wouldn't. That's what she
	          was after, though. But why hit on
	          me?
	
	                    ROY 
	          I wouldn't go in on a deal with
	          her. She blamed you for it.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (a shaky laugh)
	          As though you do what I say.
	
	                    ROY
	              (cold grin)
	          That's pretty funny, all right.
	          What happened in Phoenix?
	
	Remembered emotion makes Lilly talk in little fast clusters
	of words.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Roy, it was terrible. You read
	          about people killing people and all
	          that, but when it happens, my God.
	
	EXT. ARIZONA MOTEL - NIGHT
	
	Myra, in nightgown, carrying the ice bucket, approaches Room
	131.
	
	                    LILLY
	          She was in her nightgown, you know,
	          the old grifter's dodge, nightgown
	          and the Ice bucket and she just got
	          into the wrong room by mistake.
	
	INT. ROOM 131 - NIGHT
	
	CU, Lilly asleep. Very dim light. The shadows shift on her
	face as Myra OUT OF FRAME approaches. Myra's hands ENTER
	FRAME, abruptly clamp on Lilly's throat. Lilly's eyes pop
	open wide, staring, her mouth stretches open. Myra's arms are
	locked straight, pressing her weight down onto her hands
	squeezing Lilly's throat. Lilly clutches at Myra's fingers,
	tries to reach Myra's face, twists and squirms, then suddenly
	lifts her arm up and behind her head, hand dipping under the
	pillow, coming out with the silenced gun, pushing the gun
	upward, straight-arm, the gun moving up OUT OF FRAME. SOUND
	of shot. Blood sprays Lilly's face. Myra's body drops down
	onto her, at an angle, so we can still see Lilly's horrified
	face over Myra's shoulder as Lilly gasps for breath.
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Lilly stares across the room, breathing hard, reliving the
	experience.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          I sat in there with her, I thought,
	          what do I do now? Run and I've got
	          Bobo and the law after me. Stay,
	          and how do I explain?
	
	                    ROY 
	          This way's perfect.
	
	Lilly sits back, showing that relief again.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a
	          break for me after all.
	          I've been wanting out of the racket
	          for years, and now I'm out. I can
	          make a clean start, and --
	
	                    ROY 
	          You've already made a start.
	          Doesn't look that clean, though.
	
	Here's the awkwardness. Lilly looks guilty and embarrassed.
	
	                    LILLY
	          I'm sorry. I hated to take your
	          money, but --
	
	                    ROY
	          Don't be sorry. You're not taking
	          it.
	
	Lilly reacts as though he's slapped her. But then she gets
	her determination back. She splays out both hands, palm down,
	on the attache case on her lap.
	
	                    LILLY
	          I need this, Roy. I can't run
	          without money, and if I can't run
	          I'm dead.
	
	                    ROY 
	          You must have some money.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Just a few bucks.
	
	                    ROY 
	          And Myra's stuff?
	
	                    LILLY
	              (scornful)
	          Her credit cards. How far am I
	          gonna get with that?
	
	                    ROY 
	          Far enough. Maybe up to San
	          Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace
	          new. Start over.
	
	                    LILLY
	          At what?
	
	                    ROY 
	          You're smart, Lilly, and you're
	          good-looking. You won't have any
	          trouble finding a job.
	
	                    LILLY 
	              (appalled)
	          A job? I've never had a legit job
	          in my life!
	
	                    ROY 
	          Well, you're gonna start, if you
	          hope to live through this. A square
	          job and a quiet life. You start
	          showing up at the track or the hot
	          spots and Bobo's boys will be all
	          over you.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (exasperated)
	          Roy, I know what to do with myself!
	          It's a big world out there.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Not any more. Lilly, listen, I'm
	          giving you good advice. I'm
	          following it myself.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (doesn't get it)
	          What?
	
	                    ROY 
	          I thought it over, and you were
	          right. You wanted me out of the
	          rackets, and now --
	
	                    LILLY
	              (bedeviled, aggravated)
	          Roy, that's fine, but I don't have
	          time for this. Bobo --
	
	                    ROY
	          I thought you'd be happy for me.
	          After all, you --
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after
	          me, and he's goddamn good! But so
	          am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I
	          survive.
	
	                    ROY 
	          I know you do, so that's why --
	
	                    LILLY 
	          And to survive, my way, I need
	          money.
	          Bobo knows about the stash in the
	          car, so I didn't dare touch it, not
	          if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that
	          leaves this.
	
	                    ROY
	          No.
	
	Lilly sits back again, brooding at Roy, trying to think how
	to get to him, how to get through him or around him. She
	sighs, licks her lips.
	
	                    LILLY
	          You want a drink?
	
	                    ROY 
	          I don't think so. You probably
	          shouldn't either.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice
	          water?
	
	                    ROY
	          Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
	
	                    LILLY
	          I'll get it.
	
	She stands, putting the attache case on the sofa next to
	where she was sitting. Roy, with a faint smile, watches her
	leave the room.
	
	INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
	
	Very small, little used. Dark. Lilly switches on the light
	when she enters, then leans against the counter, fists
	clenched and trembling on the counter in front of her. She
	grits her teeth, hyperventilates, stares around the room in
	search of escape, an answer, something.
	
	CU, Lilly's face, desperate, grim, but not giving up.
	
	WIDE SHOT. Lilly opens cabinets, finds two glasses, opens the
	nearly-empty refrigerator, gets ice cubes from a tray, puts
	them in the glasses, puts the partial tray back in the
	freezer compartment, fills the glasses from the cold water
	tap, puts the glasses on the counter, stares at them briefly.
	She then shakes her head, searches the kitchen some more, and
	finds a cookie sheet she can use as a tray. She puts the
	glasses on the tray, carries the tray from the room, leaving
	the light on.
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Lilly enters with the tray, crosses to Roy, presents the
	glasses, speaks as he reaches for one.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Take whichever one you want.
	
	He hesitates. It hadn't occurred to him Lilly might try to
	poison him or knock him out. He grins at her and takes a
	glass.
	
	                    ROY 
	          You wouldn't do that.
	
	Lilly takes the other glass, puts the cookie sheet on a
	table, looks down at Roy.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          You don't know what I'd do, Roy.
	          You have no idea. To live.
	
	                    ROY
	              (easy)
	          Oh, you'll live, Lilly.
	
	Lilly crosses back to the sofa, sits beside the attache case,
	pats it absently as though it is a pet and she's glad it
	didn't move, waited for her. She sips water, puts the glass
	on the end table.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          I know what's bugging you, of
	          course.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Oh? I didn't know anything was.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (twisted grin)
	          Oh, really? You've got a legitimate
	          complaint, Roy, I don't deny that.
	          I wasn't a very good mother when
	          you were a kid.
	
	                    ROY
	              (full laugh)
	          Not very good!
	
	She nods, accepting the correction.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          A bad mother. By any standards.
	          I've thought about it, you know,
	          from your side, since then. I know
	          just how bad I was.
	
	                    ROY
	              (closed against her)
	          Uh-huh.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          I wonder did you ever think about
	          it from my side.
	
	                    ROY
	              (not worth discussing)
	          Never.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          No, I guess not. It was pretty
	          lousy of me, I guess, to be a child
	          at the same time you were. Not to
	          stop being a child just because I
	          had a child. I guess I was a real
	          stinker not to be a grown-up when
	          you needed a grown-up.
	
	Roy didn't expect to be made uncomfortable and defensive, and
	he resents it.
	
	                    ROY 
	          What do you want me to do? Pin a
	          halo on you? You're doing a pretty
	          good job of that yourself.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          And making you feel bad at the same
	          time, huh? But that's the way I am,
	          you know, the way I've always been.
	          Always picking on poor little Roy.
	
	                    ROY 
	          For God's sake, Lilly!
	
	                    LILLY
	              (intense)
	          I gave you your life twice. I'm
	          asking you to give me mine once. I
	          need the money.
	
	                    ROY
	              (not worth discussing)
	          No.
	
	Lilly subsides back onto the sofa. One hand rests on the
	attache case. With the other, she sips water, puts the glass
	back down. Roy watches her, unmoving, expressionless. Lilly
	frowns, not quite looking at him.
	
	                    LILLY
	          You're getting off the grift?
	
	                    ROY 
	          That's right.
	
	                    LILLY
	          That's good. You don't really
	          belong on this side of the fence,
	          you know.
	
	                    ROY 
	              (amused)
	          I don't?
	
	                    LILLY
	          If you stayed a crook, do you think
	          you'd live to be my ripe age?
	
	                    ROY 
	          I don't see why not.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Well, I guess I got it wrong, then.
	          Seems to me I heard about a guy
	          just your age that got hit so hard
	          in the guts it almost killed him.
	
	Roy's again unexpectedly uncomfortable. He shifts uneasily in
	his chair, trying to think of a response.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Well, uh...
	
	                    LILLY
	          Sure, sure, that doesn't count.
	          That's different.
	
	                    ROY
	          Well, it doesn't matter, does it?
	          I'm getting out.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (intense)
	          And that's why you've got to get
	          rid of this money. If you keep it
	          around, it'll just make you think
	          how clever you are.
	          It'll be a temptation to get back
	          into the game.
	
	                    ROY
	              (full laugh)
	          Oh, that's it! You're stealing my
	          money for my own good! How very
	          motherly of you, Lilly.
	
	Once again, Lilly drops back against the sofa back. Another
	round in the fight is over. Roy watches her, patient, waiting
	for her to give up, seeing no other outcome.
	
	AN ANGLE on Lilly, frustrated, feeling the need to move, the
	pressure of pursuit. Her head turns back and forth, her body
	starts false gestures. Finally, abruptly, she gets to her
	feet, looks at Roy, looks away, picks up the attache case.
	
	CU, Roy, alert. He won't let her reach the door.
	
	AN ANGLE PANNING with Lilly as she prowls the room, pacing
	back and forth, the attache case swinging at her side.
	Finally, she stops, standing the attache case on the coffee
	table, her hand still on its handle.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Lilly.
	
	She looks at him, attentive without hope.
	
	                    ROY 
	          If I should get out of the racket,
	          that goes double for you. That's
	          why you've got to change your life
	          completely, go to some town, get a
	          square job, live like a john
	          yourself. If you try to do it your
	          way, what future is in it?
	
	                    LILLY 
	          A future. The only future I've got.
	
	                    ROY 
	          That money wouldn't last forever.
	          And then what? You'd be back in
	          some other part of the rackets.
	          Another Bobo Justus to slap you
	          around and burn holes in your
	          hands. This way, you've got to go
	          the square route. You could send me
	          a card when you're settled, I could
	          maybe help out sometimes...
	
	                    LILLY
	              (bitter laugh) )
	          That's what it is, isn't it? Keep
	          me down. Your turn to be in charge,
	          have the power.
	
	                    ROY
	              (stonewalling)
	          Just trying to help, Lilly.
	
	She sits on the sofa again, this time leaving the attache
	case to stand on the coffee table. She studies Roy,
	calculating.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Roy... What if I told you I wasn't
	          really your mother? That we weren't
	          related?
	
	                    ROY
	              (bewildered)
	          What?
	
	Lilly leans back again, but this time her manner is
	different; languorous, sexy. She crosses her legs, the upper
	leg swinging gently. She smiles gently, encouragingly, at
	Roy.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          You'd like that, wouldn't you? Sure
	          you would. You don't need to tell
	          me. Now, why would you like it,
	          Roy?
	
	AN ANGLE on Roy, understanding and not wanting to understand.
	
	                    ROY
	              (hoarse)
	          What's that all about? Of course
	          you're my mother. Of course you
	          are.
	
	TWO SHOT. Lilly leans forward toward Roy, inviting him.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (very soft)
	          Roy... Roy
	
	Roy will not let anything complicated come to the surface.
	
	                    ROY 
	          There's nothing more to talk about.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (very soft)
	          I have to have that money, Roy.
	          What do I have to do to get it?
	
	AN ANGLE on Roy, his face bruised-looking, eyes scared. He
	will not know what's going on. He shakes his head, not
	trusting himself to speak.
	
	AN ANGLE on Lilly, leaning forward, tension showing through
	the seductive manner.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          No? Won't you give me the money,
	          Roy? Can't I change your mind? What
	          can I do to change your mind?
	
	TWO SHOT, as Lilly gets to her feet and takes a step toward
	him. Roy's pressed back into his chair, trying to maintain a
	cold facade.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Lilly, Jesus, what are you doing?
	
	                    LILLY
	          Is there nothing I can do, Roy,
	          nothing at --
	
	                    ROY 
	          NO!
	
	They both turn away at the same instant. Roy turns to the
	side to pick up the glass of water, to break the spell and
	the tension. Lilly turns back toward the coffee table and
	picks up the attache case. Roy, lifting the glass to drink,
	turns forward again as Lilly spins forward, swinging the
	attache case at his head with all her might. The case crashes
	into the glass and into his face. Roy SCREAMS and topples off
	the chair, as the one remaining clasp on the case lets go and
	money goes flying, filling the air.
	
	AN ANGLE DOWN at Roy, face up, expression horrified, hands to
	his throat. A large triangle of glass is in his throat. Blood
	pumps thickly, fountaining up.
	
	CU, Lilly, staring down in horror. She lurches forward, but
	there's nothing to do. She stares around.
	
	ECU, wads of bills on the floor, getting bloody.
	
	CU, Lilly, in agony, but looking down, kicking.
	
	ECU, Lilly's feet kicking the bills away from the blood. 
	
	TWO SHOT, as Lilly drops to her knees beside Roy, who's
	already dying. Blood spurts less forcefully. His hands fall
	to his sides, eyes stare upward, mouth still moves slightly.
	Lilly, shoving money away with her hands now, stares at him,
	willing it not to happen. He stops moving. His eyes dull.
	Lilly clasps her arms around herself. She knows she doesn't
	dare scream. Lips drawn back in a snarl, teeth clenched, she
	HISSES her agony through her teeth. She HISSES; she HISSES;
	she HISSES. Then, slowly, she regains control.
	
	WIDE SHOT as Lilly gets to her feet. She seems dazed now,
	like someone who's just been in a traffic accident. She
	blunders around the room, kicks the attache case, bends to
	pick it up. She studies the clasp, sees it still works, goes
	back to her knees.
	
	LOW ANGLE, Lilly in f.g., Roy in b.g., as Lilly repacks the
	money into the case, wiping the blood from some wads onto the
	carpet. Finishing, she closes the case, then remains on her
	knees, bending over the case. She WEEPS grindingly.
	
	WIDE SHOT, entrance door in b.g. Lilly's weeping subsides.
	She gets wearily to her feet, and leaves the room. CAMERA
	HOLDS. SOUND of water running in sink. SOUND STOPS. Lilly
	reappears. She does not again look toward Roy. She picks up
	the attache case, crosses to the door, opens it, steps across
	the threshold, reaches back to switch off the light. GO TO
	BLACK.
	
	                          THE END

	FADE IN:

	ROLL CREDITS OVER:

	EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAWN

	VARIOUS EXTRA CLOSE-UPS of this luxurious patchwork of 
	brilliant greens:

	A POLISHED BRASS SPRINKLER HEAD

	pops up from the ground and begins to water the already dew-
	soaked lawn.

	FLEET OF DUCKLINGS

	No mother in sight, cruise through the thrushes.

	GRAVEYARD OF GOLF BALLS, UNDERWATER

	At the bottom of a water hazard.

	PALM FRONDS

	After a neat they sway, revealing the barren desert that 
	surrounds the artificial oasis. The sun already bakes the 
	air. We hear the opening guitar strains of the Kim Deal-Kurt 
	Cobain suet of "WHAT I DID FOR LOVE," as we CRANE DOWN the 
	palms to

	A BRAND-NEW TITLEIST 3 BALL.

	Just on the edge of the rough. A pair of yellow trousers 
	moves in. An iron confidently addresses the ball, and chips 
	it out. The trousers walk out after it.

	HANDS

	Digging dirt out of the grooves of the iron's face with a 
	golf tee, while on the way to the green. Both hands are 
	gloved, instead of one, and the gloves are black.

	YELLOW TROUSERS

	In a squat over the ball, sizing up the curvy, fifty-foot 
	journey to the hole. The figure positions himself and the 
	putter above the ball, then pops the ball lightly. The ball 
	rolls and bobs with purpose toward the hole, dodging hazards 
	and finding lanes, until it finally falls off of the green 
	and into the hole.

	THE GLOVED HAND

	Sets the ball on the next tee. The figure moves to a leather 
	golf bag. The hands pull the wipe rag off of the top of the 
	bag and drop it on the ground, reach into the bag, drawing 
	out a compact SNIPER RIFLE, affixed with a long silencer. 
	The figure drops one knee down onto the rag, the other foot 
	firmly setting its spikes. We move the figure to see the 
	face of the sniper, concentrating down the scope in his half-
	squat. He is MARTIN BLANK.

	We SWING AROUND behind his head to look down the barrel with 
	him. Four-hundred yards away, on another part of the course, 
	another green is barely visible through groves of trees and 
	rough. Three miniscule, SILVER-HAIRED FIGURES come into view. 
	One of them, in a RED SWEATER sets up for first putt. He 
	could be an investment banker, or an arms trader.

	MARTIN'S ARM

	Flinches, and a low THUNK reports from the rifle. A second 
	later in the distance, the

	RED SWEATER'S HEAD

	Seems to vanish from his shoulders into a crimson mist. His 
	body crumples to the green.

	MARTIN

	Returns the rifle to the bag, pulls out a driver, moves to 
	the tee and whacks the ball. He watches its path and whispers 
	absently...

				  MARTIN
		Hooked it. 

	INT. CLUB HOUSE PATIO - LATER

	The outdoor post-golf luncheon area of an elite Texas golf 
	club. Martin sits in on the fringes of a conversation between 
	a group of executive types. CLUB MEMBER #1 has a Buddha-like 
	peace in his eyes through the philosophical talk.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		I'd come to the realization that 
		everything I'd based my life on was 
		false. And that my life had no 
		meaning.

				  CLUB MEMBER #2
			(to Martin)
		He gets this way when he hits over 
		eighty-five.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		It seemed like my life was slipping 
		away, somehow. I was a knot in the 
		middle of a wet rope. Everything was 
		futile and nothing had value.

				  CLUB MEMBER #3
		That's the way life is. The only 
		meaning and value is what we create. 
		Through structure, and discipline. 
		Though they seem to limit our freedom, 
		they actually give us great comfort. 
		Your problem is you're looking for 
		some great answer. Some ultimate 
		truth. When what you really should 
		do is go to work and go home.

				  CLUB MEMBER #2
		And take golf lessons.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		That's a tragedy. Can I finish my 
		story please? I began my search for 
		meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, 
		Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I 
		went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, 
		herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, 
		and a psychic. And they all pretty 
		much say the same stuff.

				  CLUB MEMBER #2
		A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are 
		telling you the same thing? You're 
		insane.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		Basically the same thing. In a very 
		evolved, esoteric way.

				  CLUB MEMBER #2
		Insane.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		To make a long story short...

				  CLUB MEMBER #3
		--Thank God--

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		...at last I found the holistic system 
		of systems that opened up the doors 
		of heaven for me right here on earth. 
		And everyday I see the world through 
		the eyes of a child. A world of 
		creation and wonder.

				  CLUB MEMBER #2
		Jesus...

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		Overflowing with love.

				  MARTIN
		Tell me about it.

	Club Member #1 turns to Martin.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		P.P.P. Personal Pan Power. All the 
		secrets of your universe are divided 
		up into eight easily digestible 
		slices.

	Club Member #1 pulls a laminated card from his wallet and 
	hands it over to Martin. In the distance, sirens begin to 
	wail.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		See, see. It's in the accessible and 
		everyday shape of a pan pizza. Each 
		day you have a little slice of 
		peace...

	INSERT - WALLET-SIZE P.P.P. CARD

	A pizza-shaped diagram showing six "sections".

				  MARTIN
		Oh I see. You got your individual 
		slices of hope, dignity, confidence, 
		self-love, justice, and harmony.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		You open 'em up and there's the 
		sayings, stories, little bites of 
		insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day 
		Week.

				  MARTIN
		So you eat-- read it everyday?

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		Yes.

				  MARTIN
		And these pan pizzas have opened up 
		the doors to heaven?

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		Correct.
			(re: the card)
		That's for you. Keep it.

	Sirens are getting louder, closer to the club.

	EXT. COUNTRY CLUB - DAY

	The source of the sirens are almost upon us. Martin walks 
	toward his rented Town Car as the VALET pulls it up. He meets 
	the Valet by the trunk, where he trades tip for keys.

				  MARTIN AT CAR
		He fishes out the laminated "Personal 
		Pan Power" card, looks at it, and 
		tosses it onto the ground. Police 
		cars, now visible in the distance, 
		wind into the long club driveway. 
		Martin gets into his car and pulls 
		away.

	LAMINATED CARD

	As it lays on the asphalt. The wheel of a police car rolls 
	to a stop on it.

	INT. AIRLINER - DAY

	Martin sits in a first class seat, the tray table flipped 
	down. On the left side of the tray is a stack of magazines 
	of all kinds - Sports Illustrated, Mademoiselle, Wired, 
	Rolling Stone, National Review, Spin, National Geographic, 
	and on. He draws one off the top, and flips through it, 
	impassively taking in images and reading nothing. When he is 
	done with one, he discards it into the empty seat next to 
	him and draws another-- Martin's way of instantly and 
	massively uploading the world around him:

	Toothless hockey player in triumph, Sony product parade, 
	crouched starving child with vulture in the background, 
	supermodel in suede, Tic Tacs, living former Presidents, arm 
	in arm, smiling, etc.

	INT. HIRED CAR, NEW YORK - DAY

	The livery weaves out of the arrival lanes at Kennedy airport. 
	Martin reclines in the back seat, a conversation having 
	already begun.

				  DRIVER
		How was your day, today, sir?

				  MARTIN
		Effective. But to tell you the truth, 
		I've lost my passion for work.

				  DRIVER
		Do you like the people you work with?

				  MARTIN
		I work alone.

				  DRIVER
		That's it then. That's it. I've always 
		been alone. That's why I'm a good 
		driver. I can handle it. See, I can 
		think on my feet. I survive, I'm a 
		thinker. And I can sit there in front 
		of your house for two hours and it 
		don't bother me. Some people can't 
		do it! Some people are ranting and 
		raving, "Tell them fuckin' people to 
		get out here and get in this car, I 
		can't-- I want a go!" Where you gonna 
		go? You're gonna wind up back in 
		your garage at seven o'clock at night. 
		You ain't going nowhere. You leave 
		your house in the morning you get 
		back to your house in the evening. 
		What's the big deal, right?

				  MARTIN
		You understand the psychology of the 
		job.

				  DRIVER
		I do. Some guys can't adjust to it; 
		they can't handle it.

	INT. CAR - MANHATTAN STREETS - LATER

	The car cuts through the upper east side. Martin and the 
	Driver exchange looks through the rear-view mirror.

				  DRIVER
		You look like you're far away. Far 
		away and thinking about other things. 
		I'm right about that, aren't I?

				  MARTIN
		No.

				  DRIVER
		Well, let's just say that sometimes 
		I'm right. Sometimes you are.

				  MARTIN
		Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only 
		natural.

				  DRIVER
			(laughs to himself at 
			this great truth)
		It's only natural....

	The Driver pauses for dramatic emphasis

				  DRIVER
		I been looking at you, and I've 
		decided that I want to share something 
		with you.

				  MARTIN
		Okay.

				  DRIVER
		Because your problem is you're bored. 
		And you have a very big mind.
			(beat)
		I am part of what I call a brain 
		syndicate.

	No reaction from Martin.

				  DRIVER
		I am part of a network of minds, a 
		group of five people who are all 
		connected, over hundreds, even 
		thousands of miles, through the mind. 
		We can think with each other, think 
		for each other. I can be driving 
		somewhere, sleeping with a woman-- 
		whatever it is-- and at the same 
		time be thinking a thought in someone 
		else's mind, far away. Running someone 
		else's brain.

				  MARTIN
			(indicates)
		Up on the right.

				  DRIVER
		And when you think of it, it's not 
		so surprising that a small group of 
		people control the whole world, is 
		it?

	INT. HOTEL ROOM, NEW YORK CITY - DAY

	A sedate and well-appointed four-star suite on the Upper 
	East Side. Martin stands in front of one of the open windows 
	watching the canopied entrance of an elegant high-rise across 
	the street. He lifts an eye rinse cup to his eye and tilts 
	it back. A cellular phone RINGS, interrupting him. He moves 
	to the desk and draws one of three phones from his briefcase, 
	depresses a scrambler module, flips it open, and listens for 
	a moment.

				  MARTIN
		If it's not there, I can't proceed. 
		Tell them.

	Martin hangs up. Picks up another phone and dials. As he 
	waits for an answer, he goes to a Fed Ex blueprint tube lying 
	on the bed.

				  MARTIN
		Tom. I've been waiting for an answer. 
		I'm only in town tonight.

	He breaks the shipping seal and pulls out a series of finished 
	metal parts including a long thin barrel, a scope, and a 
	silencer.

				  MARTIN
		What's different this time than the 
		last time? I have to be down front...

	INT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME

	Martin stands in front of the window, phone in one hand, the 
	scope in the other. Next to him, the assembled rifle rests 
	across the arm of a chair.

				  MARTIN
		...I don't bother to call anyone 
		else because you always take care of 
		me.

	He glances over to a second window to his left, which offers 
	a view further down the street. He goes to it. He raises the 
	scope and sees

	MARTIN'S P.O.V./SCOPE- WINDOW #2

	A few blocks down, small even through the high-powered scope, 
	is your average BICYCLE MESSENGER dressed in lycra racing 
	gear, weaving through traffic toward us. Slung low across 
	his right hip is a black canvas bag. The Messenger's hand is 
	hidden in it. The other phone begins to RING.

				  MARTIN
		Hold on a second, Tom. I got my hands 
		full here.

	He sets down the phone and answers the other, still watching 
	the messenger.

				  MARTIN
		Good. Account number 3649367, transfer 
		to account number 96-546-38739-47825. 
		Ask for Mr. Sanchez, tell him it's 
		Mr. Duckman. If there are any 
		problems, access file 673594638-IO-
		98, and look at it.

	Martin drops the phone and moves away from Window #2 to the 
	rifle. He mounts the scope and he looks out Window #1 at the 
	high-rise.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V./SCOPE - WINDOW #1

	Of a DOORMAN opening the door for a group of five men in 
	suits. Four BODYGUARDS form a perimeter around the fifth 
	man, a mall, avuncular figure in his forties dressed in 
	Saville Row finery.

	MARTIN

	Takes a step back into the shadows of the room, and raises 
	the rifle toward Window #2.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V./SCOPE - WINDOW #2

	of an empty street. The bicycle messenger flashes past.

	MARTIN

	concentrating, tracks the path of the Messenger, leading him 
	left to right across the blind spot of the hotel room wall 
	between Window #2 and Window #1.

	STREET

	the bicycle Messenger bears down on the group of men, drawing 
	a Mac-10 submachine gun from his bag. The group see him-- 
	just as Martin's sniper FIRE explodes the Messenger's chest. 
	Two of the Bodyguards collapse onto their boss. The other 
	two open fire on the Messenger as he wipes out horribly into 
	a parked car in front of them.

	MARTIN

	withdraws from the window, and picks up the phone again and 
	begins to break down the rifle.

				  MARTIN
		Sorry Tom. But look, I know it's the 
		playoffs. That's why I'm offering a 
		thousand dollars for one seat...

	Martin listens patiently as he works.

	EXT. STREET - SAME - INTERCUT

	DOORMAN'S HANDS

	unbuttoning his double-breasted long coat.

	MARTIN

	just finishes packing.

				  MARTIN
		...Well let me ask you, Tom. What do 
		I have to do to get courtside tickets 
		for the Knicks...?

	STREET

	The two bodyguards kick at the Messenger's body. The other 
	two begin to move off of their boss, who rises cowering. The 
	Doorman stands behind it all, unbuttoning his coat.

	DOORMAN

	a tall, dark, sharp-featured man in his forties, wearing a 
	handlebar moustache. He moves toward the group of men as he 
	flips open his coat back over two huge chrome .44 Magnum 
	Charthouse Bulldog revolvers and OPENS FIRE on them.

	MARTIN

	is closing his bag when he hears the gun-thunder.

				  MARTIN
		Never mind. I gotta go.

	Martin drops the phone, grabs his scope, and spins to the 
	window.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V./SCOPE

	of the Doorman kicking through the pile of dead bodyguards. 
	He gets to the man at the bottom-- their boss. The Doorman 
	FIRES both guns.

	MARTIN

	reacts, surprised to see a second shooter. He pulls himself 
	from the window, puts away his scope, and accelerates his 
	exit.

	HIGH-RISE FOYER

	Outside, we see the doorman drop both guns on the pile of 
	bodies. He walks back toward us through the glass doors and 
	makes his way through the building toward the service exit. 
	He sheds his uniform and stuffs it into a plastic bag.

	MARTIN

	his two parcels in hand, exits out the side door of the hotel 
	and walks down the street.

	DOORMAN

	now wearing rich man's sweats, hops off the loading dock, 
	walks to a Lincoln Town Car, and drives off.

	INT. MARTIN'S AND GROCERS CARS - DAY

	Martin rolls down FDR Drive in a Lincoln Town Car once again 
	on the cellular.

				  MARTIN
		...Tell them that's not my problem. 
		I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- 
		not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella.

				  MARCELLA
		Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.

				  MARTIN
		Patch him through....

	Martin notices another Town Car appears in the next lane. We 
	recognize the Doorman behind the wheel, phone in hand. He is 
	GROCER.

				  MARTIN
		What do you want?

				  GROCER
		I'm setting up a concern that would 
		enable those of us in our rarefied 
		profession to consolidate our efforts.

				  MARTIN
		Like a union?

				  GROCER
		Like a club. Work less, make more.

				  MARTIN
		Thank you, no.

				  GROCER
		We could be working together, making 
		big money, killing important people... 
		I'm willing to let you in on the 
		ground floor.

				  MARTIN
		And you could be... sort of like... 
		a father figure to me....

	Grocer ignores this.

				  GROCER
		It's a free-market evolution. You'll 
		wake up to it... c'mon Kid. We used 
		to run together when you were a 
		rookie. I don't want to run against 
		you. This thing's real. Everybody's 
		in.

				  MARTIN
		Not me. So don't paw at me with your 
		dirty little guild.

				  GROCER
		I'm gonna get you, kid.

	Martin hangs up and pulls away.

	INT. AIRLINER - DAY

	Martin sits in first class, wiping his face and hands with 
	an airline hot towel. He folds the wet cloth and once again 
	speeds through the images from a thick stack of magazines. 
	He looks up as he hears PILOT V.O.  It's seventy-six degrees 
	and partly cloudy in Chicago this afternoon...

	INT. APARTMENT, CHICAGO - NIGHT

	Martin walks into a sparsely furnished apartment. He wearily 
	drops his carry-on bag and briefcase in the hall.

	INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

	Martin sits on a futon couch watching MTV with no sound. On 
	the coffee table in front of him is a phalanx of vitamin 
	bottles. Martin takes some capsules from each and washes 
	them down with a reddish-orange beverage.

	INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

	Martin lies on his back on the hardwood floor. His eyes are 
	closed and he wears a set of headphones as he absently taps 
	his chest.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		"Dear Alumni: Can you believe it's 
		been ten years? Where are you now...?

	After a moment, his eyes open, alerted. His head turns to 
	the side, and his hands lightly cup the headphones.

	CLOSE-UP: WIRE

	from the headphones as it winds to a small metal box, with 
	one unmarked switch and one amber light- definitely not a 
	walkman. The wire continues out of the other side of the 
	box, across the floor, connecting to a suction cup stuck to 
	the floor.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...Are you guiding an Outward Bound 
		canoe trip like Brook Stinson? Or 
		perhaps in charge of appearances for 
		the NFL like Leslie Gunther....?

	MARTIN - A MINUTE LATER

	draws a pre-cut section of the floor, the width of a pencil 
	and twice as long, by a string.

	VIDEO MONITOR - A MINUTE LATER

	The greenish Starlight (night vision) image of a young, HUSKY 
	MAN sleeping on his back, as seen from above. A fine thread 
	snakes from behind CAMERA to just above the man's slack mouth. 
	We PULL BACK to reveal a Sony Watchman that holds the IMAGE. 
	KEEP PULLING to reveal Martin watching it as he maneuvers 
	the thread down past the fiber-optic cable through the hole 
	in the floor.

	MARTIN - A MINUTE LATER

	concentrates as he applies three drops of blue liquid on the 
	thread. As the drops run down along the thread through the 
	floor, his attention shifts to the

	VIDEO MONITOR

	The drops, huge in the foreground, become smaller as they 
	make their way down the line toward the sleeping man.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...Could it be that you're like Chip 
		Longfellow, at the trade-relations 
		tank in Washington. Sandy Glasser 
		owns a cheese shop...!

	MARTIN

	adjusts the thread minutely with one hand, and lowers the 
	fiber-optic cable with the other.

	VIDEO MONITOR

	The face begins to fill the screen as the fiber-optic follows 
	the drops toward it. Suddenly, the man snorts and turns his 
	face...

	A DROP FALLS

	It misses the man's mouth and hit's his cheek.

	VIDEO MONITOR

	The man's eyes snap open in terror as he looks directly into 
	CAMERA. His image falls away as the fiber-optic is jerked 
	back up through the hole in the floor.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...Looking at yearbooks and pictures 
		evokes so many memories...!

				  MARTIN (V.O.)
			(hushed)
		Fuck!

	MARTIN

	stuffs the apparati into an open duffel bag, and flies out 
	of frame.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...Some good. Some bad. But all 
		interesting...

	INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

	A BODYGUARD sits outside an apartment door. A muffled but 
	dire scream is heard from within and he is on his feet, gun 
	in hand. An exit door in the hallway slams open revealing 
	Martin, his gun already pointed at the Bodyguard. The 
	Bodyguard levels his at Martin.

				  MARTIN
		Freeze! Police!

	The Bodyguard hesitates just long enough to get double-tapped 
	through the head.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...As a graduate of the class of 
		1984, you are someone special...

	Martin moves to the dead Bodyguard, and locates a retractable 
	key chain on his belt. He unreels the ring of keys and opens 
	the door. He lets the keys retract back to the belt and drags 
	him into the apartment.

	INT. HUSKY MAN'S APARTMENT - SECONDS LATER

	Martin moves silently down the hall in a crouch. He comes to 
	the bedroom and slips across the threshold.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...Whenever news of you filters back, 
		the school is excited and proud of 
		your accomplishments...

	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Martin crouches down outside the bedroom door. He points the 
	gun at the door, and reaching up turns the knob. As the door 
	opens, the Husky Man FIRES wildly over Martin's head. Martin 
	returns with one shot to the hut which sits the man down on 
	the floor.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...We hope Grosse Pointe High prepared 
		you well to lead the kind of life 
		that makes an impact on the world...

	Martin kicks the gun away from the fallen man, and raises 
	his barrel to the man's forehead.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...Remember, "there's no where you 
		can go that you haven't learned how 
		to go in time... It's easy..."

				  HUSKY MAN
			(in severe pain)
		Whatever it is that I'm doing that 
		you don't like I'll stop doing it.

				  MARTIN
		It's not me.

	Martin cocks the gun....

	EXT. EAST-WEST HOLDING COMPANY, LOS ANGELES - DAY

	The perpetual sun shines down on a small lot of pre-fab office 
	bungalows.

	INT. BLANK HOLDING COMPANY

	A small suite of dry-walled offices.

	EAST-WEST HOLDING COMPANY

	is stenciled on glass doors behind Martin who stands in front 
	of a young woman reading from some kind of invitation. She 
	is MARCELLA MAYES.

				  MARCELLA
		...So come on back to the old oak 
		tree, acorns. Signed, the reunion 
		committee."

	Marcella holds up the mauve envelope and smiles slyly. For 
	the first time, Martin looks scared.

				  MARTIN
		Throw that away.

				  MARCELLA
		This?

				  MARTIN
		Don't tease me. You know what I do 
		for a living.

				  MARCELLA
		It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. 
		How was the trip?

				  MARTIN
		Tedious. I now authorize you to throw 
		away all personal mail.

				  MARCELLA
		All of it?

				  MARTIN
		And not show it to me. Ever again.

				  MARCELLA
		That's going to cost.

				  MARTIN
		I'll pay.

	Martin begins to walk past her into his office, but Marcella 
	stops him.

				  MARCELLA
		They're not happy, sir.

				  MARTIN
		I'm not happy.

				  MARCELLA
		They say their friend was suppose to 
		have a heart attack and die in his 
		sleep.

				  MARTIN
		He didn't.

				  MARCELLA
		They blame you for the compromise.

				  MARTIN
		And they want me to make up for it.

				  MARCELLA
		In Detroit. This weekend.

				  MARTIN
		Tell them that's impossible. I need 
		my normal lead time.

				  MARCELLA
		They were very upset.

				  MARTIN
		Would you describe their position as 
		inflexible?

				  MARCELLA
		Intractable, sir. You leave tonight.

	Marcella looks concerned.

				  MARCELLA
		And sir, I also get that broken-
		mirror, black-cat, Friday-the-
		thirteenth kind of feeling about 
		this one....

				  MARTIN
		There's nothing to be done about it.

				  MARCELLA
		I liquidated the last account in 
		Zurich, and split it into two new 
		ones in Estonia.

				  MARTIN
		Good. What else? Anything interesting?

				  MARCELLA
		Mmm, not really. But you're gonna 
		love this one.

	She hands him a piece of paper. He scans it.

				  MARCELLA
		Enough?

				  MARTIN
		Never enough.

				  MARCELLA
		But it's a Greenpeace boat. It'd be 
		so easy.

	Martin looks at her wearily. He puts it into the paper 
	shredder at the side of her desk.

				  MARTIN
		I have scruples. Next.

				  MARCELLA
		Paperwork on the Detroit thing. It's 
		a full dossier. Very comprehensive.

	She raises a thick brown dossier from the top of her desk 
	and puts it down again. Martin moves through a door to his 
	private office.

	MARTIN'S OFFICE

	Martin goes into his office and sits at his desk. On the 
	walls are a couple of boring prints of tallships. A bookshelf 
	holds trappings of a loose attempt at a cover-- a few shipping 
	manifests, sealane tables, and other specialized reference 
	books on import/export. He sits and stares.

	NEW ANGLE

	Time has passed, and Martin still sits at his desk massaging 
	his gums with a rubber-tipped dental pointer.

	C.U. MARTIN'S TEETH

	The dental tool jumps across the gaps between his teeth like 
	a hummingbird.

				  MARCELLA
			(off-screen)
		You should get going....

	MARTIN

	pulls back his jacket lapel and fits the utensil into a pocket 
	protector that is also home to a toothbrush, emery board, 
	tweezers, and comb. He stands and walks out of his office.

	FOYER

	Martin moves toward the door. As he passes Marcella she hands 
	him the mauve envelope and a travel portfolio.

				  MARCELLA
		Don't forget your identity.

				  MARTIN
		See you next week.

	Martin stops short as he reaches the threshold. He holds up 
	the envelope, and stares a dagger through it. On his way 
	out, over his shoulder...

				  MARTIN
		Tell Dr. Oatman I'm on my way.

	INT. DR. OATMAN'S OFFICE - DAY

	Martin slouches on a leather couch. He holds the mauve 
	envelope, now open.

				  DR. OATMAN (V.O.)
		Why don't you want to go to your 
		high school reunion?

				  MARTIN
		It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do 
		I have in common with those people? 
		Or with anyone?

	DR. OATMAN sits in the window. He is Kris Kringle-esque, and 
	wears a sheepskin vest, rough-hewn shirt, faded Levis, and 
	old Frye boots. Oatman nods with the suave understanding of 
	a man happy to collect fifty thousand in fees before asking 
	a tough question.

				  DR. OATMAN
		You went to school with these people.

				  MARTIN
		Come on.

				  DR. OATMAN
		We've spent a lot of time discussing 
		those years. Remember we said that 
		fear is a transfer of the bodily 
		hurt associated by experience with 
		the thing feared, to the thought of 
		the thing. Thus we fear a dog without 
		distinctly imagining its bite.

				  MARTIN
		Shouldn't you be taking notes?

				  DR. OATMAN
		Tell me about your vision of the 
		reunion.

	CLOSE-UP - MARTIN

								   CUT TO:

	MARTIN'S P.O.V. - FROM ABOVE

	Of a crowded gymnasium. The alumni below stops what they are 
	doing and look up at Martin, DRAWING GUNS OF ALL SHAPES AND 
	SIZES AND OPEN FIRE ON MARTIN. THE UNITED FORCE INSTANTLY 
	DISINTEGRATES, AND ALL 400 PEOPLE TURN THEIR GUNS ON EACH 
	OTHER. A BLOODBATH ENSUES. ONE ALUMNI SHOOTS HER OWN HEAD 
	OFF, ANOTHER MOWS DOWN THE BAR, ETC.

							   CUT BACK TO:

	MARTIN AND OATMAN

				  MARTIN
		It'll be depressing.

				  DR. OATMAN
		How do you know?

				  MARTIN
		I just know.

				  DR. OATMAN
		Say more.

				  MARTIN
		They'll have husbands and wives and 
		children and houses and dogs.... 
		made themselves a part of something. 
		And they can talk about what they 
		do. What am I going to say?
			(sarcastic)
		"I killed the President of Paraguay 
		with a fork."

	Oatman twitches nervously, almost spilling his coffee.

				  DR. OATMAN
		You needn't be so frank with me about 
		your work.

				  MARTIN
		Why not. I trust you. You couldn't 
		turn me in because of Doctor-Patient 
		privilege... and I don't want to be 
		"withholding"... and I know where 
		you live.

				  DR. OATMAN
		You know where I live?

				  MARTIN
		We're both professionals, Oatman.

				  DR. OATMAN
		I think what you fear Martin is 
		domesticity. It's the greatest fear 
		that men have who belong to Western 
		Culture. It's centuries old. Like 
		King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th 
		century who decided one day that he 
		was so bored with his dreary life at 
		home with his wife he thought, "Well, 
		wouldn't it be great if we hit the 
		road and fought... oh... the 
		Saracens."  So he put the word out 
		and was amazed when a million men 
		signed up and all of them wanted to 
		go and fight in distant lands and do 
		terrible things to people rather 
		than stay at home with their families.

				  MARTIN
		So you're saying that Ulysses--
		everything he said to his queen when 
		he came back--everything was a lie? 
		He just wanted to fuck around?

				  DR. OATMAN
		Yes.

				  MARTIN
		Mmm.

	Beat.

				  DR. OATMAN
		And how have you been feeling about 
		your... work lately?

				  MARTIN
		Uneasy. Dispassionate. Bored. It's 
		just getting hard to go to work in a 
		good mood. I'm starting to think 
		I've been in the business too long. 
		Last week I did a guy younger than 
		me.

	INT. CHURCH -

	SERIES OF QUICK SHOTS:

	MARTIN

	From the back of the darkened empty church, we see him mount 
	the altar.  A priest in fact.

	MARTIN'S HANDS

	open the gilded doors to reveal the chalice. He removes it, 
	squirts a clear liquid into the cup, and swishes it out. He 
	returns the chalice to the cabinet.

				  MARTIN (V.O.)
		The church seems to be purging itself 
		of it's pedophile.

	MARTIN

	Sits in the back pew of the church, now crowded for Mann. He 
	watches the PRIEST lift the chalice into the air, murmur a 
	prayer, and drink from it. The Priest collapses behind the 
	altar.

				  MARTIN (V.O.)
		It's a bull market.

	C.U. OF ALTAR CARPET

	The chalice bounces free from the Priest's hand as it hits 
	the ground.

				  MARTIN (V.O.)
		Anyway, that never use to happen. I 
		was always the prodigy. Now I'm just 
		one of the guys.

				  DR. OATMAN (V.O.)
		Maybe some of the discomfort you're 
		feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over 
		the innocent people you've killed.

	INT. OATMAN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

				  MARTIN
		If I show up at your door, chances 
		are you did something to bring me 
		there. I don't care about that stuff, 
		anyway.

				  DR. OATMAN
		What stuff?

				  MARTIN
			(dismissive)
		Morality.

	Oatman's glad the session's just about over.

				  DR. OATMAN
		Go to your reunion, Martin. See those 
		people and discover what they mean 
		to you. Try not to kill anybody for 
		a few days, see how you feel.

				  MARTIN
		If I get antsy I'll kill a few small 
		animals.

				  OATMAN
		Now we're making progress.

	INT. CONDO - NIGHT

	Very dark. No pictures or plants. Almost no furniture, and 
	what he does have is black. The only sign of life is a CAT. 
	The cat watches on as Martin sorts through a cardboard box, 
	finally coming to a photo album.

				  CAT
		Meow.

				  MARTIN
		Just a minute.

	INSERT-ALBUM

	A teen-aged Martin Blank: shy boy with a nervous smile. He 
	poses with his mother, an older woman with a kind smile... 
	but her eyes are dark; aged by a life of work and worry. On 
	the opposing page is a gilt funeral announcement that reads: 
	"IN LOVING MEMORY... VISTOR ALLEN BLANK...."

	MARTIN

	turns the page.

	INSERT-PHOTO ALBUM

	A photograph of a tall, thin girl: a bright smile from within 
	a bulky winter coat. A girl he's always wondered about: DEBI 
	NEWBERRY. Handwritten on the photo in girlish loops: "Would 
	you rather...?!"

				  CAT
		Meow!

	INT. KITCHEN - SAME

	Martin pulls himself away from the album and the cat follows 
	him, moaning hungrily--

				  MARTIN
		Food soon...

	Martin opens a restaurant-style refrigerator. It holds various 
	bottles of vitamins, spirulina, wheatgrass, digestible 
	hydrogen peroxide, fluoride treatment, oxygenated mouth rinse, 
	and thirty cans of CATFOOD.

				  MARTIN
		Tuna or liver?

				  CAT
		Meow.

				  MARTIN
		Tuna it is.

	He opens a can for the cat and a bottle for himself. While 
	the cat eats, he returns to the cardboard box. Finds a 
	YEARBOOK. Flips it open....

	INSERT-YEARBOOK

	A picture of a senior class "Blues Brothers" party: a group 
	of teens mug to the camera in Blues Brothers get-ups. 
	Sprinters race for a finish line, their chests stretching 
	for the tape.

	DEBI NEWBERY'S SENIOR PICTURE

	A more mature version of the girl in the album. Her name 
	appears under his picture...

	INT. GROCER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

	Track light fills the gourmet-rustic kitchen. GROCER stands, 
	wearing a burgundy Fila sweat suit, pushing beets into a 
	vegetable juicer. Next to the juicer are piles of celery and 
	carrots, as well. A low-key BLIP is heard from another room. 
	Grocer tops off the glass and takes it out of the kitchen.

	INT. GROCER'S GREAT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Grocer enters the main room of the villa-style A-frame. He 
	moves to an antique oak desk and sits in front of a COMPUTER.

	ON-SCREEN GRAPHICS

		  "Click OK for remote access caller"

	OK is clicked.

		   "Availability for two days in Detroit area"

				 "Terms"

				"$560,000"

				  "When"

				  "Now"

				"OK/ FAX materials"

	Grocer leans back in his chair and sips the juice. After a 
	moment, the FAX machine on the desk rattles. The computer 
	beeps.

	  "confirmation number of wire transfer#: AJ6687-OI99471"

	Grocer hits the return button after taking in the number. A 
	graphic appears:

		"Connection is terminated/ Status idle"

	Grocer's FAX begins to moan and chatter. Grocer raises his 
	juice glass to the computer in a lazy toast.

	INT. PLANE - NIGHT

	Martin reclines in first class, soaring toward the Midwest 
	on the red-eye. He has already scanned his magazines and 
	they are piled in the empty seat next to him. He sets aside 
	a Powerbar. Martin reads Kill Without Joy. After a moment, 
	he sets the book down and takes up Iron John.

	INT. DETROIT AIRPORT TERMINAL - EARLY MORNING

	At the edge of the airport bar sits LARDNER and MCCULLERS, 
	two Government Spooks, agency unknown. They are both in 
	blazers, no ties, early thirties, and they watch the passing 
	crowd.

				  LARDNER
		You always say that. You always say 
		that. I'm telling you, you never met 
		the man.

				  MCCULLERS
		Seventeen months ago I was posting a 
		walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He 
		never saw me. But I saw him, though.

				  LARDNER
		Lisbon?

				  MCCULLERS
		In Portugal, yes.

	In the background, Martin passes by them as he walks down 
	the hall. Without directly regarding him, the two stand, 
	drop some cash on the bar, and begin to leave.

				  LARDNER
		Here's the news: He hasn't been in 
		Portugal since '90. I know that from 
		the file. Why don't you read the 
		file, man?

				  MCCULLERS
		In fact, I think I talked with him, 
		in Bonn.

	Lardner can neither confirm nor deny this.

				  LARDNER
		You always say that. You always have 
		to know everybody. Why don't I just 
		take the weekend off and let you 
		kill him. Since you two are so close.

	They exit.

	EXT. EXIT RAMP, DETROIT AIRPORT - MORNING

	INSIDE MARTIN'S CAR

	Martin, in a black Lincoln Town Car, veers off of the airport 
	artery and on to a turnpike. The radio broadcasts the news.

				  BROADCAST (V.O.)
		...with highs today in the upper 
		seventies. Related stocks on Wall 
		Street today as scandal continues to 
		rock the joint U.S.-Japanese Tech 
		Center...

	MARTIN'S CAR

	blows past CAMERA and on down the road. After a beat, a mid-
	eighties Ford Country Squire station wagon follows, occupied 
	by two figures.

	INSIDE THE COUNTRY SQUIRE

	are Lardner and McCullers. They listen to the same broadcast.

				  BROADCAST (V.O.)
		...An unknown "whistle-blower" has 
		leaked a number of critical flaws in 
		the safety designs of next year's 
		models to authorities that could 
		cost millions in recalls....

	MARTIN

	flips through the dial, pausing on Rush Limbaugh who waxes 
	fascistically.

				  MARTIN
		Mein hero.

	...and then turns the dial again and cuts in on "Armageddon 
	Time," slow reggae vibe by The Clash.

	EXT. HIGHWAY-

	Martin drives down the roadway... headlong into his past. 
	Dig it...

	INT. MARTIN'S CAR

	Martin turns up the volume as he reacts to a familiar 
	voice....

				  FEMALE DEEJAY (V.O.)
			(on radio)
		--this is WFRN, all vinyl, all the 
		time. Oldies from the eighties. It's 
		a cold summer day in Grosse Pointe--

								   CUT TO:

	CLOSE-UP - A FULL, FEMALE MOUTH

	lit only by dime slivers of sunlight, in front of a 
	microphone. Stray, gossamer strands of hair hanging in her 
	face move in front of her mouth as she speaks....

				  FEMALE DEEJAY
		--and I'm ready for some good tunes 
		and angry talk. Or angry tunes and 
		good talk--

								   CUT TO:

	MARTIN

	looking somewhere far away, beyond what is before him in the 
	windshield...

				  FEMALE DEEJAY (V.O.)
		--Or maybe we'll just play the Cocteau 
		Twins and get over the goo-angry-
		talking music. As you know--

								   CUT TO:

	THE DEEJAY'S HANDS

	as they distractedly toy with the wire at the base of the 
	mic.

				  FEMALE DEEJAY (V.O.)
		--for some moments in life there are 
		no words, and a little nonsense now 
		and then is relished by the wisest 
		man--

								   CUT TO:

	MARTIN

	still rapt, makes a sharp turn into a shopping district.

								   CUT TO:

	HER MOUTH

				  FEMALE DEEJAY
		--The Cocteau Twins, though also a 
		band of the nineties, will be aired 
		due to the fact that they created 
		their own language to sing by--

								   CUT TO:

	MARTIN

	slows on a quaint street of cute shops. He creeps up to a 
	storefront on hid right and stops, staring through the 
	passenger window....

								   CUT TO:

	DEBI NEWBERRY

	the female deejay. She sits slumped in a well-worn executive 
	chair, her back to the studio console and the picture window 
	behind it that opens to the street....

				  DEBI
		--Now that's freedom--

	she swivels in the chair to face the street....

	DEBI'S P.O.V.

	of Martin's Town Car outside, Martin silhouetted in shadow.

	DEBI

	Her brow furrowed as she peers at the car, something summoned 
	by the dark figure. Her words falter almost imperceptibly.

				  DEBI
		--The best I can do is a rhyme: Where 
		are all the good men dead? In the 
		heart or in the head? Back later....

	MARTIN

	Shaken from his trance by her stare, pulls back into the 
	street and disappears....

	INT. MARTIN'S CAR - MORNING

	Martin drives, listening to the radio. He turns the corner 
	with an expectant look on his face. Suddenly his face drops 
	as he slows and pulls over....

	MARTIN'S P.O.V. - 7-11 STORE

	Martin looks left of the store, then right, behind him, then 
	back at the store. Bewildered, he gets out of the car.

	WIDE SHOT

	of Martin as he walks with purpose. He halts in the middle 
	of the lot. He puts his hands on his hips, stares, then moves 
	in... We stay wide as he enters the store and addresses the 
	clerk inside.

				  MARTIN
		What are you doing here?

	CARL, the store clerk tries to get a grip on this question.

				  CARL
		A double shift. What's it look like?
			(softening)
		Can I help you with something?

	Martin's head pans the room, processing.

				  MARTIN
		I don't think so.

	EXT. 7-11 PAYPHONE - MORNING

	Martin continues to gaze at the structure as if it's a lunar 
	landscape.

				  MARTIN
			(into phone)
		Dr. Oatman. Dr. Oatman. Please pick 
		up if you're there... It's Martin 
		Blank. It's gone. My house. It's not 
		here. My house is gone and now there's 
		a 7-11 here... And that's 
		unfortunate... You can never go home 
		again, Dr. Oatman.

	Martin hangs up. He watches one-stop shoppers come and go.

				  MARTIN
			(to himself)
		But I guess you can shop there.

	INT. NURSING HOME - DAY

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	of a NURSE leading him down a drab, antiseptic hallway. She 
	banks into the sunlit room where a wispy woman in her late 
	fifties sits expectantly on the edge of the bed clutching 
	her purse in one hand, a filterless Pall-Mall in the other, 
	a light coat on. This is MARY BLANK. She suffers from 
	Alzheimer's or something just as debilitating.

				  NURSE
		Mary, your son's here.

	The nurse gently eases Mary up. Martin hugs Mary stiffly and 
	pats her shoulders. Mary takes hold of Martin's arm. They 
	start out of the room.

	EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

	They walk past a school-yard park fitted with a set of swings, 
	baseball diamonds, and a small grove of trees. She smokes 
	and hacks.

				  MARY
		I bought a new rug.

				  MARTIN
		That's wonderful, Mom.

				  MARY
		What's a revival tent?

				  MARTIN
		It's a place where religious people--

				  MARY
			(knowingly)
		Marlin Perkins and Jim!

				  MARTIN
		Jim?

				  MARY
		His assistant. He acted like Marlin's 
		son, only he wasn't. At least they 
		never said he was... I bet they were 
		lovers, faggots. Yes, gay lovers. 
		Wild Kingdom my ass!

	Mary coughs horribly.

				  MARTIN
		It's good to see you. I'm sure you're 
		curious about what I've been doing.

				  MARY
		I spoke to your father the other 
		day.

				  MARTIN
		I imagine that'd be rather difficult.

				  MARY
		Nature made him then broke the mold.

	Martin decides to change the subject.

				  MARTIN
		They told me you're taking lithium, 
		mom.

				  MARY
		Yes, they give me headaches. I have 
		a headache.

				  MARTIN
		You have a headache?

				  MARY
		I have a headache. You have a 
		headache?

				  MARTIN
		No, I don't have one.

				  MARY
		You don't have a headache. I have a 
		headache.

	Mary leans in close, smiling.

				  MARY
		We had a good laugh, didn't we?

				  MARTIN
		Yeah. I guess we did.

	EXT. NURSING HOME - DAY

	As they head toward Martin's car, Mary stops and points to 
	it.

				  MARY
		Why don't you return this car and 
		borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to 
		the rent-a-car so you can get a ride 
		back.

				  MARTIN
		I think I'll go see Debi today.

				  MARY
		Of course you will.

				  MARTIN
		I can't think of anything to say to 
		her that seems appropriate given I 
		left and never said goodbye to her.

				  MARY
		Take care of her. She's a keeper.

				  MARTIN
		Yeah...

				  MARY
		And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro 
		on foreign exchange?

				  MARTIN
		I have always thought about her and 
		missed her.

	A nurse approaches with a wheelchair.

				  MARY
		Separate the wheat from the chaff 
		and you've got the candle cat.

	Together, Martin and the nurse help Mary into it. Mary gazes 
	at Martin, taking him in.

				  MARY
		Remember no matter how impossible 
		your problems feel. I've known people 
		without a chance in the world. And 
		all of a sudden, they have lives.  
		Time allows miracles. Let yourself 
		breathe, son.

	Martin bends down and kisses her on the cheek. The nurse 
	spins the chair around and heads toward the building. He is 
	somewhat fatigued from the experience, but he tries once 
	more to connect.

				  MARTIN
		Mom...

	The nurse stops and turns Mary around to face him. Mary looks 
	up at Martin and brightens. She starts to sing out like Ethel 
	Merman, arms out Broadway style.

				  MARY
		"What's up doc/ what's cookin'?/ 
		What's up doc?/ Are ya lookin'?/ 
		Hey! Look out!  You're gonna hurt 
		someone,/ with that old shotgun,/ 
		Hey... what's... up... Doooooc...!/ 
		We really mean it!"

	Mary stops short, and squints at Martin.

				  MARY
		Hey, you're a handsome devil. What's 
		your name?

	EXT. GRAVEYARD ROAD - DAY

	Martin stops the car and looks out the window at the sea of 
	headstones. He jerks his hand in a stiff wave...

				  MARTIN
		Hey Pop... You got off easy. The 
		house is a 7-11. Mom's a psycho-
		pharmacological punching bag and I 
		murder for cash. If you were here I 
		think you'd be proud.

	He drives off.

	INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - DAY

	The room features a big square bed, dresser and television. 
	Martin enters, kicks a leather bag under the bed, and grabs 
	the steel-sided briefcase.

				  MARTIN
		pries out a wall vent, slides in the 
		case and replaces the vent.

	EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

	Lardner and McCullers are staked out along the main strip of 
	town. Lardner snores, face pressed up against the passenger 
	window. McCullers lays back in his seat, a to-go cup in his 
	lap. He taps the cup with one finger as he absently sings 
	his favorite Bob Seeger song to himself...

				  MCCULLERS
		"...Against the wind... just a young 
		man running... Against the wind... 
		let the cowboy's ride!... Blame on 
		it the thuuunder! Night moves..."

	McCullers catches of Martin's Town Car coming down the street. 
	He nudges Lardner, and points.

	LARDNER AND MCCULLERS P.O.V.

	of Martin pulling into a space on the street outside the 
	radio station. He gets out, looking nervous.

	INT. RADIO STATION - DAY

	Debi flips on the "ON-AIR" switch and prepares to speak into 
	the microphone. Martin walks in. Debi sees him. They stare 
	at each other. The song ends. Dead air. After a moment...

				  DEBI
			(on air, groping)
		WRFN playing all vinyl, all the time. 
		Oldies from the eighties. That was 
		ah... the Specials. Doing... one of 
		their songs...

	Debi turns to turntable B and finds it empty. She turns back 
	to turntable A and lets the record roll on.

				  DEBI
		...and here's another.

	Debi swivels around to face Martin.

				  MARTIN
		"Oldies from the eighties?"

	After a long pause....

				  DEBI
		I just play my own collection.

				  MARTIN
		It's nice to see you again.

	Debi says nothing, just stares at him, in shock.

				  MARTIN
		How long has it been?

				  DEBI
		Since you stood me up on prom night 
		and vanished without saying a word?

				  MARTIN
		Ten years, I think. What I miss?

	Debi slowly grooves into irony, her best defense.

				  DEBI
		Well, let me see... they tore down 
		the George Orwell monument and put 
		up a bust of George Michael. Main 
		Street's a four-laner, no left turns 
		four to seven. I was married and 
		divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now 
		officially the new sister city to 
		Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have 
		fiber-optic town meetings every two 
		months.

				  MARTIN
		Here is now there. There is here.

	Their eyes lock on each other...

				  DEBI
		Those are the headlines.

	The request line buzzes.

				  DEBI
		Hold that thought.
			(into phone)
		WRFN FM, Grosse Pointe. All vinyl, 
		all the...
			(pauses)
		No Pearl Jam. Call back in ten years.

	Beat. Debi makes the move.

				  DEBI
		Tell me about yourself.

				  MARTIN
		I'm in California most of the time. 
		Traveling a lot on business. That's 
		about it, really.

				  DEBI
		That's it?

				  MARTIN
		Not much else.

				  DEBI
		What's your business?

				  MARTIN
		I'm a professional killer.

				  DEBI
		Professional killer. Do you get dental 
		with that?

	Beat.

				  MARTIN
		Well, I'm in town for a few days, 
		anyway.

	They run out of words, the moment too big for small talk. 
	Martin gets the fear, breaks it off.

				  MARTIN
		Well, I gotta go. But I'll come back.

				  DEBI
		Okay.

	Martin leaves Debi sitting alone, in disbelief.

	EXT. RADIO STATION - DAY

	Martin steps out of the storefront station along the 
	fashionable Grosse Pointe shopping district. He stops in the 
	middle of the street with a strained look on his face.

	INT. LARDNER & MCCULLERS' COUNTRY SQUIRE - SAME

	LARDNER & MCCULLERS' P.O.V.

	of Martin standing in the street.

	LARDNER AND MCCULLERS

	They frown, wondering at Martin's next move.

	INT. DEEJAY BOOTH -

	Debi lost in thought, still. After a moment, she sits upright 
	and flips the "ON-AIR" switch.

				  DEBI
			(into mike)
		A man comes to you. He is from the 
		past bringing you pain long since 
		put behind you. He says peculiar 
		things and leaves abruptly. It all 
		comes flooding back...

	EXT. STREET -

	Martin stops in his tracks. His face softens, then becomes 
	determined. He turns and walks back toward the station.

	INT. DEEJAY BOOTH -

	Debi broadcasting...

				  DEBI
		It felt like an apparition, or some 
		cheap, gruesome Rod Serling time 
		warp I'd been thrust back into without 
		warning. There's a strangeness in 
		the air and I don't mind telling 
		you, I'm a little spooked. He was a 
		man from my past. A man I loved. A 
		man who disappeared.

	DEBI'S P.O.V.

	of Martin walking back into the station.

				  DEBI
		A man who's walking back into the 
		station.

	Martin comes into the booth. The temperature rises as they 
	square off.

	INT. COUNTRY SQUIRE -

				  LARDNER
		Well?

				  MCCULLERS
		I don't think so.

				  LARDNER
		Well, remember when Frysal's men 
		paid off the Deejay in Cairo to 
		announce a bogus press conference in 
		the --

				  MCCULLERS
		--Nooo--

				  LARDNER
		--Yes. And the Munich Olympics in 
		'72. A local radio station started 
		broadcasting news of the massacre 
		two minutes before it happened.

	McCullers is not to be outdone.

				  MCCULLERS
		That's strictly Bàader-Meinhof stuff.

				  LARDNER
		It was the PLO.

				  MCCULLERS
		Whatever.

	INT. DEEJAY BOOTH

	Martin and Debi locked in a passionate embrace. They break 
	away.

				  DEBI
		Sit.

	Martin obeys. Debi clandestinely flips the "ON-AIR" switch 
	as she drops into her chair. The "ON-AIR" light bar goes on 
	above and behind Martin. Unbeknownst to him their conversation 
	is put out over the airwaves.

				  DEBI
		All right mystery man. I want some 
		answers. Let's recap. Spring of '84. 
		Two young lovers with frightening 
		natural chemistry. The girl sits in 
		a seven-hundred dollar prom dress at 
		her father's house waiting for the 
		most romantic night of her young 
		life. The boy never shows up, until 
		now. So, what's the question?

				  MARTIN
		Where have I been?

				  DEBI
		More like what happened? What 
		happened, Mr. Blank?

				  MARTIN
		I don't know exactly. I could venture 
		a guess but it would sound like a 
		rationalization... I thought you 
		know... maybe seeing you, some 
		friends, my house... of course now a 
		7-11--

				  DEBI
		--Torn down in the name of convenience--

				  MARTIN
		--and I guess, sure, seeing you would 
		be part of that whole equation... I 
		suppose the most important thing, 
		really. I don't know. Anyway, this 
		whole thing's my therapist's idea. 
		It's my shrink, really.

				  DEBI
		Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?

				  MARTIN
		You see someone?

				  DEBI
		Uh, no. So you're back now, a decade 
		later, and you want to sort things 
		out with me. The question now is, do 
		I allow you... access... to my being?

	Martin says nothing.

				  DEBI
		All right then. Would you like to 
		share any more deeply personal 
		thoughts with our listening audience 
		before we go to our phone poll and 
		see how the folks in radioland come 
		down on this one?

	A beat as Martin realizes he's been had. He seems about to 
	bolt.

				  DEBI
		Should a broken-hearted girl give a 
		guy a second chance at love....

	Debi jabs a phone line on the console.

				  DEBI
			(HARD)
		You're on the air.

	Martin deflates.

				  OLD WOMAN'S VOICE
		I think this young man has avoided 
		the question completely. Has not 
		discussed "what happened" nor if 
		he's sorry for what he has done. 
		Therefore, I don't see any reason 
		why you should see him until he fully 
		discloses his intentions and feelings.

				  DEBI
		Thank you caller.

	Stabs another line.

				  DEBI
		You're on the air.

				  DUMB GUY VOICE
		Are you there?

				  DEBI
		Yes.

				  DUMB GUY VOICE
		No, the guy.

	Martin looks up, humiliated.

				  MARTIN
		Yeah....

				  DUMB GUY VOICE
		Uh... when you guys use to go out... 
		Did you guys ever... heh heh heh 
		heh... ever fuckin', ever totally 
		fuckin' heh heh heh-

				  DEBI
		Next caller.

				  GUFF MAN VOICE
		I don't know, Debi. Sounds like bad 
		gas to me. I would not allow him 
		access to your being.

				  DEBI
		Thank you.

				  DEBI
		Grosse Pointe Michigan, I hear you 
		loud and clear: "If you love something 
		set it free. If it comes back to you 
		it's, well...

	She turns to him and shrugs apologetically.

				  DEBI
		...Broken...."

	Martin has his answer.

	EXT. RADIO STATION - DAY

	Martin leaves the station, alone and beaten down.

				  MARTIN
		Dammit. Never trust my instincts.

	He scans the main strip.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	A MAN walks down the street. He is FELIX, a bookish, 
	forgettable man in his forties, wearing Le Coq Sportif sweats 
	and shoes. He looks as if he has a dark cloud over his head. 
	Martin's seen him somewhere, and doesn't like what he 
	remembers. Martin's POV TRACKS him.

	FELIX'S P.O.V.

	As he walks down the street, he spots the Country Squire, 
	and eyes Lardner and McCullers in the front seat.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	follows Felix's eyes to Lardner and McCullers and catches 
	their look. Their eyes lock, neither wanting to betray that 
	they've made each other. They all do a pretty good job. His 
	P.O.V. swings to a square-jawed, hale fellow wearing dark 
	sunglasses who is approaching directly and only a few feet 
	away. The man is going for something in his breast pocket...

	Reaches into his own jacket, most likely for a gun....

	THE MAN

	pulls out a glasses case, and takes off his shades-- He is 
	PAUL SWIDERSKI.

	MARTIN AND PAUL

	Martin relaxes.

				  PAUL
			(grinning ear-to-ear)
		Hell, I would've voted for you, but 
		there's all this apple sauce stuck 
		in my phone... I don't wanna talk 
		about it. How the hell are you?!
			(extends his hand)
		Here's five good ones!

	No trace of recognition on Martin's face.

				  PAUL
		Marty! It's me. Paul.

				  MARTIN
			(realizing)
		Paul?

				  PAUL
			(re: hand)
		You're leaving me hanging here...

	They shake. Martin looks him up and down, astonished at the 
	respectable veneer of his old burn-out friend.

				  PAUL
		Hey. Give me a break.

	INT. PAUL'S BMW - DAY

	Martin and Paul rive through Grosse Pointe, Michigan: Wide 
	streets lined with huge, shady oaks. Castle-like homes on 
	golf-course green lawns. A comfortable, Midwestern Beverly 
	Hills. They are cruising their old haunts, Paul smoking a 
	joint.

				  PAUL
		This won't take but a minute. I just 
		gotta hold their hands for a final 
		walk-through. I'll take them in, get 
		'em out, then you and I can grab a 
		little quality time.

	Martin looks out the window, breathing in the past.

				  PAUL
		Goddamn, It's good to see you. I was 
		afraid you joined a cult or something. 
		I half-expected you to come back to 
		town in a fennel wreath and paper 
		pants.

	Paul offers Martin the joint. He declines.

				  MARTIN
		There was no money in it.

	Martin regards Paul archly.

				  MARTIN
			(grinning)
		So what happened to you?

				  PAUL
		Same thing that happened to you-- I 
		stopped poutin' there on the 
		sidelines. Got in. Got on the team.  
		I joined the working week, you slick 
		fucking asshole, so why don't you 
		valet park your high horse and take 
		it easy on your old buddy, Paul.

				  MARTIN
		Fair enough.

	Beat.

				  PAUL
		God it's great to see you.

				  MARTIN
		You too.

	EXT. FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT HOUSE - DAY

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	of a lovely YOUNG COUPLE on the front porch of a mid-sized 
	Wright home... Perhaps that could be him if things were 
	different, but for now it feels like along shot. Paul is 
	hawking the house to them out of earshot.

				  SOUTHTEC GUARD (V.O.)
		Well, we do what we have to do if we 
		find you on the property. But we 
		don't really enforce the law, we 
		execute company policy for homeowners.

	MARTIN AND THE GUARD

	standing in the driveway.

				  MARTIN
		So when are you authorized to use 
		deadly force?

				  SOUTHTEC GUARD
		Well, a 'course, taxes provide your 
		basic service-- police and whatnot. 
		But our customers need a little more 
		than just that, you understand? This 
		badge doesn't mean that I am a peace 
		officer.

	The woman turns at Martin and smiles. Martin smiles back.

				  MARTIN
		So it's not a meaningful symbol, or 
		anything. That badge is just the 
		badge of your company. If I look 
		suspicious on your customers' property--
		well, under those heightened 
		circumstances you have the authority 
		to, ah... To shoot me.

				  SOUTHTEC GUARD
		To shoot you. Correct.

				  MARTIN
		How did you get this job?

				  SOUTHTEC GUARD
		Well, they were hiring, and it was 
		only a two week course...

				  MARTIN
			(pleasantly)
		Wow.

	Paul walks the happy couple down the steps.

				  PAUL
			(to couple)
		...What more can I say.

				  HUSBAND
			(smiling)
		We'll talk soon.

				  PAUL
			(much hand gesturing)
		You'll be raising your new family in 
		a work of art. A work of art in a 
		work of art.

	Paul looks at Martin and the Guard, inviting them into the 
	sell.

				  SOUTHTEC GUARD
		I'm sure you'll be very happy.

	All look to Martin....

				  MARTIN
			(heartfelt)
		When my time comes, if it ever does, 
		I want a beautiful, normal place 
		like this... and a wife like you...

	All are confused. Martin thumbs to the guard.

				  MARTIN
		...and you'll be safe here...

	Paul looks at his shoes and rolls his shoulders.

	EXT. FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT HOUSE

	Lardner and McCullers sit in the wagon, watching the house 
	in the distance.

	INT. PAUL'S BMW - LATER

	Martin and Paul cut through a particularly charming 
	neighborhood.

				  PAUL
		Now. I don't make a habit of pimping 
		my friends, but there is one prime 
		little piece of land that you must 
		see...

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	A sprawling gingerbread mansion rises into view. A long and 
	winding driveway cuts through thickly wooded property to the 
	house.

				  MARTIN (V.O.)
		Debi's house.

				  PAUL (V.O.)
		Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?

	C.U. OF MARTIN

				  MARTIN
		No. You drove us here.

				  PAUL
		Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, 
		isn't it?

				  MARTIN
		No.

	Martin's not listening. His eyes track the house out the 
	window.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	of the mansion.

	They roll slowly by Debi's house.

	They drive in silence for a beat. Paul suddenly swerves to 
	the shoulder, jams the brake, and turns on Martin.

				  PAUL
		Ten years. What happened!?

				  MARTIN
		I freaked out, joined the Army, worked 
		for the government, and went into 
		business for myself... I'm a 
		professional killer.

				  PAUL
		Thank you.

	Paul, satisfied, gets back on the road.

				  PAUL
		Professional killer, huh? Does that 
		come with a good HMO?

	EXT. ROAD - DAY

	Paul makes a turn. They approach a large car dealership. The 
	sign above it says

		  "DESTEPHANO'S BAVARIAN MOTOR WORKS"

				  MARTIN
			(looking ahead)
		He sells BMW's?

				  PAUL
		He sold me this bad boy.

				  MARTIN
		How could you put your hard-earned 
		dollars into the hands of the class 
		bully?

				  PAUL
		He gave me a great deal.

				  MARTIN
		Mein Dealer.

	Paul slows outside the lot. BOB DESTEPHANO-- a big, angry-
	looking man in an expensive suit-- stands in the lot, puffing 
	up amidst his stable of expensive cars.

				  PAUL
		Hey! Bob! The car's running great.

				  BOB
			(dismissive)
		Glad to hear it.

	Bob turns his back on them and begins to walk away.

				  MARTIN
			(shouts)
		Bob...

				  BOB
			(turning)
		What?

				  MARTIN
		It's me. Martin Blank.

				  BOB
		Really...? So what?

				  MARTIN
		Okay. See you later.

	EXT. RADIO STATION - NIGHT

	Martin climbs out of Paul's car and begins to walk toward 
	his own. Paul calls after him.

				  PAUL
		See you at the left-a-boy-came-back-
		a-man-made-good party.

	Martin nods him off. Paul pulls away.

	MARTIN

	stands across the street from the radio station, looking at 
	Debi in the window... Martin draws a thin rifle scope from 
	his back pocket, and lifts it to his eye...

	MARTIN'S P.O.V. - SCOPE

	of Debi, in the crosshairs, bored, tapping a pencil to the 
	beat of an unheard song.

	MARTIN

	dejected. He puts the scope away and gets in his car.

	INT. 7-11 - NIGHT

	Martin walks into the store, looking around once again at 
	his old home. To the left of the door, a typical suburban 
	teenage SKATEBOARDER is lost in the "Mortal Combat" video 
	game and something too loud from his walkman. Carl, still 
	working the double, nods to Martin.

				  CARL
		Can I help you?

				  MARTIN
		What's done is done.

	Martin moves up one aisle to the gum rack. He picks out a 
	pack of Beaman's and unwraps a stick as he heads to the 
	counter. On the way, he makes a black Town Car pulling into 
	a spot next to his own. He immediately changes course, and 
	bee-lines for a rear aisle where he ducks down...

	FELIX

	Comes through the door, drawing a Mac-10 for each hand.

	MARTIN

	grabs the gum out of his mouth and sticks it onto the bottom 
	of the Glock .9mm he has produced from somewhere in his suit.

	CARL

	grabs the cash drawer, sets it on the counter, and puts his 
	hands up.

	THE SKATEBOARDER

	Plays on.

	FELIX AND CARL

	Felix shoots CARL DEAD on his way toward

	MARTIN

	Bolts up the cooler aisle. Bursts of FIRE follow him, taking 
	out each freezer door behind him.

	MARTIN AND FELIX

	EXCHANGE FIRE John Woo-style between the aisles of the cramped 
	store. Felix delivers a close-to-home burst as he jumps the 
	counter, sending Martin diving out of view.

	MARTIN

	pinned behind the Slurpee machine, pauses to reload his now 
	two Glock nines. Martin steals a glance to get a bead on 
	Felix and is met with a salvo that rocks the Slurpee machine, 
	spattering him with several flavors... and that's all he can 
	take. Martin comes up BLASTING with both guns, but all that's 
	left of Felix is swinging doors and squealing tires.

	Martin moves to the cashier island, low to the ground.

	THE SKATEBOARDER

	Twitches and jerks, still absorbed in his game and oblivious 
	to the surrounding carnage.

	CASHIER ISLAND

	Martin crawls through the waist-level swinging door and moves 
	to Carl.

	CARL

	is really dead. Martin rolls him over to check it out and 
	finds

	A BOMB

	under the corpse.

	MARTIN

	Flips the corpse back on top of the device and leaps the 
	counter toward the doors. He grabs the shoulder or the 
	Skateboarder, who shrugs him off, annoyed--

				  SKATEBOARDER
		What the fuck, man?!

	The video game screen explodes. Shot full of Martin's bullets. 
	The Skateboarder reacts backward and Martin jerks him out of 
	the double doors.

	EXT. 7-11 - CONTINUOUS

	The Skateboarder is running like crazy, and Martin's car is 
	peeling out in reverse as the 7-11 is blown to hell.

	INT. MARTIN'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

	Martin's hair is matted with Slurpee as he tries to drive 
	and cool out. He sees his do in the mirror, pulls out a comb 
	and starts to comb it back into a slick Pat Riley style.

	EXT. RADIO STATION - NIGHT

	Martin walks in, not looking half bad, considering. Debi 
	looks up from some reading. "Naïve Melody" by the Talking 
	Heads plays in the studio.

				  MARTIN
		Are you going to the reunion?

				  DEBI
		No. I'm not going. Is that why you're 
		here?

				  MARTIN
		That's part of it.

				  DEBI
		Well, you'll have a ball. You seem 
		to have everything everybody wants 
		when they go back. The car, the suit, 
		the watch. The look. That just leaves 
		the little things, like happiness, 
		character, point of view...

				  MARTIN
		It's always the little things.

				  DEBI
		Yep.

	Beat.

				  MARTIN
		I'm wondering how you've been. How 
		you are. I'd like to catch up with 
		you. If it's possible.

	Beat as Debi considers. She spins her seat to face him.

				  DEBI
		Okay. Let's catch up. You go first.

				  MARTIN
		Well, there's not much to tell.

				  DEBI
		I'm sure you've done worthwhile things 
		in the last ten years. You've had 
		experiences.

				  MARTIN
		Bad experiences.

				  DEBI
		You met people.

				  MARTIN
		Bad people.

				  DEBI
		Watched television?

				  MARTIN
		Bad television.

				  DEBI
			(amused)
		Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It 
		sounds like you need a Shockabuku.

				  MARTIN
		What's that?

				  DEBI
		It's a swift spiritual kick to the 
		head that alters your reality forever.

				  MARTIN
		That'd be good.

	Beat.

				  DEBI
		What do you want?

	The question is open.

				  MARTIN
		I figured I could pick you up tomorrow 
		around seven o'clock.

				  DEBI
		Let me get this straight, are you 
		asking me out?

				  MARTIN
		Yes.

				  DEBI
		Unbelievable.

				  MARTIN
		Seven it is.

				  DEBI
		I'll think about it.

	EXT. JOSHUA TREE CAMPSITE - NIGHT

	Under a crisp and starry night, a man and a woman sit around 
	a campfire. As we MOVE CLOSER we see that the woman is 
	Marcella reading, "Women Who Run With Wolves."  She tends to 
	s'mores on the campfire, assembles one, and hands it to MONTY, 
	her young outdoorsman boyfriend. Monty is perched on a small 
	boulder, engaged in a Tai-Chi-like ritual, wearing Patagonia's 
	finest. There is a path of crystals leading from the fire to 
	the boulder. In the background is a tent and a Nissan 
	Pathfinder. Monty's watch goes off.

				  MONTY
		Baby, it's eight o'clock.

	Marcella gets up.

				  MARCELLA
		Thanks, Monty.

	She tousles Monty's hair on the way to the truck.

	INT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

	Marcella gets in. She shuts the door and dials the phone.

				  MARCELLA
		Hey there, how'd it go?

	INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - NIGHT - INTERCUT

	Martin sits on the edge of the bed in a towel.

				  MARTIN
		It isn't done.

	Marcella pauses, taking this in.

				  MARCELLA
		This is not good.

				  MARTIN
		I'll do it tomorrow.

	Marcella considers this.

				  MARCELLA
		What's it look like?

				  MARTIN
		It's fine.

				  MARCELLA
		You haven't looked at the dossier.

				  MARTIN
			(a little defensive)
		I've looked at it.

	Martin eyes the vent.

				  MARCELLA
		You have.

				  MARTIN
		Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing 
		remarkable about it at all.

				  MARCELLA
		I have to call the client and give 
		them a reason why you're late.

				  MARTIN
		Tell them my house exploded.

	Beat. Marcella doesn't know what to make of this.

				  MARCELLA
		I'll call them and tell them you're 
		taking your time. Being a 
		professional.

				  MARTIN
		Okay, call them. Fine. Oh-- And if 
		you could find out why they double-
		booked the job, and who is trying to 
		kill me, and call me back-- that's 
		be great.

				  MARCELLA
		Will do.

	Martin hangs up. He moves up to the air vent, deciding to 
	get down to business. He pries it open, and withdraws his 
	briefcase, putting it down on the bed and propping it open. 
	He looks at the unopened dossier for a moment, flips it over 
	in his hands, and tosses it on the bed.

	BRIEFCASE

	We catch a glimpse of Martin's weapons. Martin picks up the 
	envelope and is about to tear the seal when

	THE PHONE RINGS

	Martin drops the envelope and lifts the receiver.

				  DEBI
			(filtered)
		Are you there?

				  MARTIN
		Yes.

				  DEBI
		Pick me up at my father's house at 
		around seven. And don't be late this 
		time.

	Beat.

				  DEBI
		Hello...?

				  MARTIN
		This night, this reunion will be an 
		important step in our relationship.

				  DEBI
		You're fucking psycho.

				  MARTIN
		Don't rush to judgement until all 
		the facts are in.

	She hangs up. Martin smiles and replaces the receiver. He 
	turns to the apparatus laid out on the bed.

	GUNS, BULLETS, ETC.

	What has been his life is beginning to look more like death 
	to him. He places the envelope in the case, then returns the 
	case to its hiding place.

	EXT. DINER - DAY

	Lardner and McCullers stake out Martin from the Country Squire 
	across the street.

				  MCCULLERS
		I wish he'd do his job already so we 
		could do our job.

				  LARDNER
		We can't do our job unless he does 
		his job.

				  MCCULLERS
		Why don't we just do his job then, 
		so we can do our job, and get the 
		fuck out of here.

				  LARDNER
		Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded 
		killer.

				  MCCULLERS
		Wait a minute--

				  LARDNER
		-Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, 
		but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until 
		a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and 
		then you come in and kill the Bad 
		Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.

				  MCCULLERS
		So if we do his job, we're the bad 
		guys. If we do our job, we're the 
		good guys.

				  LARDNER
		Yup.

	They both laugh, as if at some great joke. Their laughter is 
	caught short by the sight of

	LARDNER AND MCCULLERS' POV

				  GROCER
		moving into the diner.

	INT. DINER - LATE MORNING

	Martin sits in a window booth splitting nutrient caplets 
	into an apple juice and looking out the window.

	GROCER

	slides into the booth, across from Martin.

	MARTIN AND GROCER

	Martin draws a nasty little PPK pistol from his waist, and 
	levels it at Grocer under the table-- but Grocer is already 
	drawing his pistol down there, and there is an instant Mexican 
	breakfast stand-off.

				  GROCER
		Easy, tiger.

	A waitress approaches.

				  WAITRESS
		Hi. Welcome to B.I. McCafferty's. My 
		name is Melanie and I'll be your 
		server this morning. Let me tell you 
		about some of our specials. Today we 
		have the "Alfalfa on My Mind," our 
		feature omelette. And there's our 
		"Gatsby's West Egg Omelette." And if 
		you're in the mood for something 
		different there's the "I left my 
		heart in San Franchezie."

	Martin and Grocer's eyes remain locked.

				  GROCER
		I want two eggs poached, hash brown 
		well-done. English muffin for the 
		bread. And a coffee.

				  MARTIN
		Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg-
		white omelette.

				  WAITRESS
		What would you like in the omelette?

				  MARTIN
		Nothing in the omelette. Nothing at 
		all.

	The waitress nods pertly and leaves.

				  GROCER
			(re: the omelette)
		Come on, live a little. I'm sorry 
		about the incident yesterday.

				  MARTIN
		No harm no foul.

				  GROCER
		A little misunderstanding among my 
		associates.

	Beat.

				  GROCER
		I told them to kill you and they 
		didn't.

				  MARTIN
		Hard to get good help these days.

				  GROCER
		But since we're both here, I think 
		it's time to take a fresh look at 
		our relationship.

				  MARTIN
		I didn't get into this business to 
		have "associates." And I don't want 
		to join your Goddamned union. "Loner--
		" "Loner gunman." Get it? "On my 
		own." That's the whole point. Why 
		don't you become a cop, or something. 
		You can drink coffee in the morning... 
		with friends!

	Grocer looks a little hurt.

				  MARTIN
			(easing up)
		Look, this is a one-on-one business... 
		Every time you get to know people, 
		bad things happen. If it'll make you 
		feel any better, this is my last 
		job. So what do you say we put our 
		guns away and forget the whole damn 
		thing.

	Grocer loses it.

				  GROCER
		Fuck you! No scabs! From now on, 
		everything's regulated!

	Long beat as Grocer gets a hold of himself.

				  MARTIN
		No deal.

				  GROCER
		Fine. But we're not going to let you 
		do your job. Because we're gonna do 
		it. And then, after we do your job, 
		we're gonna do another little job...

				  MARTIN
			(Wry)
		Is that right?

				  GROCER
		Yeah-- after I shoot you through the 
		fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you 
		in the bullethole.

				  MARTIN
		Nice talk, Sugarmouth.

	INT. SUITE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

	Martin sits at a desk, staring at the reunion card. He tosses 
	it aside, gets up, and moves in front of a mirror. He wears 
	a crisp black suit and practices his greeting smile...

				  MARTIN
			(trying on smile)
		Yes, I'm a pet psychiatrist. I sell 
		couch insurance. I test-market 
		positive thinking. I lead a weekend 
		men's group, actually. We specialize 
		in ritual killings. I'm hungry, are 
		you hungry, I'm hungry, oooh, ooh.
			(sarcastic)
		Hi, I'm Martin Blank, remember me?  
		I'm not married, I have no kids and 
		I'd blow your brains out if someone 
		paid me enough... So how've you been? 
		Where do you stand on The Issues? 
		Are you Left? Right? Up, down, proud, 
		shamed, blahblahblahblah--

	EXT. DEBI'S HOUSE - EARLY EVENING

	Martin makes his way up the walk leading to the front door, 
	holding a simple bouquet of flowers. He skips up the front 
	steps and finds the doorbell. After a moment, Debi answers.

				  DEBI
		Flowers. That's funny.

				  MARTIN
		As long as I get the laugh.

				  DEBI
			(taking them)
		Here. Let me put these in some rubbing 
		alcohol.

	She backs into the house, and he follows.

	INT. NEWBERRY FOYER - CONTINUOUS

	Martin follows Debi into the hall. Both are enjoying this 
	atavistic ritual.

				  MARTIN
		You look beautiful.

				  DEBI
		Okay... Hold on...

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	through a doorway leading into a den. All that's visible of 
	MR. NEWBERRY, Debi's father, is a pair of legs resting in a 
	Barcolounger.

				  DEBI (V.O.)
		...Let me get my coat.

				  MARTIN
		I'll just help myself to a cocktail.

	DEBI

	moves up the stairs and disappears.

	MARTIN

	looks at the legs, rolls his shoulders, and heads into the 
	den.

	INT. DEN - CONTINUOUS

	Mr. Newberry sits in the recliner reading a Tom Clancy novel. 
	He is a corporate Aspen-dude-ranch sort with a good head of 
	hair. He sighs, closes the book on his knee and looks up to 
	Martin.

				  MARTIN
		Good evening, Mr. Newberry.

				  MR. NEWBERRY
		Good evening, Mr. Blank.

				  MARTIN
		How are you? How's business?

				  MR. NEWBERRY
		Martin, I don't know where you've 
		been since you abandoned my daughter 
		ten years ago, and I don't care. It 
		was good that you left, and I'm glad 
		you did. So what do you want to talk 
		about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe 
		I had you figured wrong.

				  MARTIN
		How's that?

				  MR. NEWBERRY
		I visualized you, in a haze, as one 
		of the slackster, flannel-wearing, 
		coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been 
		seeing in Newsweek.

				  MARTIN
		I took the other road. I'm more of a 
		self-reflective young lion who does 
		business with lead-pipe cruelty and 
		goes home to drink light beer in 
		milky-eyes isolation. I love sports 
		and sex and have no real relationships 
		with anyone. And you?

				  MR. NEWBERRY
		Oh, you know me, Martin. I'm the 
		same old sell-out baby-boomer, 
		exploiting the oppressed I got shot 
		for at Kent State. But why don't we 
		have a drink and forget the whole 
		thing?

	Newberry lays down his book, and moves behind the wet bar.

				  MARTIN
		Why not?

				  MR. NEWBERRY
		So what are you doing with your life 
		now, son?

				  MARTIN
		I'm a professional killer.

				  MR. NEWBERRY
		That's good.

	Debi's footsteps are heard coming down the stairs.

				  DEBI (O.S.)
		Okay

	Mr. Newberry watches Martin turn and walk out of the room.

	EXT. DEBI'S HOUSE

	Martin and Debi pull away from the curb.

	INT. CAR - DUSK

	Martin and Debi drive through that to Debi is town, and to 
	Martin is a widening pool of quicksand.

				  MARTIN
		Do you want to get a drink first?

				  DEBI
		I think they'll probably have booze 
		there.

				  MARTIN
		Right.

	Martin's right hand shakes off of the wheel a bit. He grips 
	it tighter. Suddenly, Martin turns the wheel and pulls into 
	a gas station parking lot, halting next to a pay phone.

				  MARTIN
		I'll just be a second.

	Debi nods, a little confused but going with it.

				  DEBI
		Okay...

	EXT. PAYPHONE - MINUTES LATER

	Martin stands at the kiosk next to the Town Car, mid-
	conversation.

				  MARTIN
			(defensive)
		...Well, I didn't kill anyone, but 
		someone tried to kill me and the guy 
		in the middle got killed. So if I 
		see that guy again I'm definitely 
		going to kill him, but I won't kill 
		anyone else. Oh, except for the guy 
		I was sent here to kill. I don't 
		know...

	INT. OATMAN'S OFFICE - INTERCUT

	Oatman treats his patient.

				  DR. OATMAN
		What else? Say more.

				  MARTIN
		Saw my mom... I'm with Debi, and I'm 
		on my way to the reunion.

	In the background, Lardner and McCullers drive past the 
	station.

				  DR. OATMAN
		Okay. Repeat this after me.

				  MARTIN
		Out Loud?

	Martin looks to Debi. She looks up and smiles. We hear Dr. 
	Oatman's command, Martin mumbles them back.

				  MARTIN
		...I am at home with the me. I am 
		rooted in me, who is on this 
		adventure.

				  DR. OATMAN
		Take a deep breath and realize, that 
		this is me breathing.

				  MARTIN
		This is me breating.

	Martin takes in a few breaths.

				  MARITN
		Alright, look. I gotta go.

				  DR. OATMAN
		And don't kill anyone.

				  MARTIN
		Right. Don't kill anyone...

	INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - SAME

	Felix rummages delicately around the room. He goes to the

	NIGHTSTAND

	The reunion invite.

	FELIX

	picks it up and scans it.

	EXT. GROSSE POINT HIGH SCHOOL - DUSK

	Lardner and McCullers sit it the parking lot. They watch 
	Martin and Debi pull into a space.

				  LARDNER
		He's falling for her. Look at him.

				  MCCULLERS
		He using her.

				  LARDNER
		You're wrong. Look at his face.

				  MCCULLERS
		One cannot love and kill.

				  LARDNER
			(defensive)
		I love. I kill.

	MARTIN AND DEBI

	climb out of the car. Martin, breathing deeply and wiping 
	his sweaty palms, leans against the car and tries to calm 
	himself. Eighties music echoes from the gym.

				  MARTIN
			(to himself)
		Shoulda brought my gun.

				  DEBI
		What?

	He pulls himself off the car and heads toward

	GROSSE POINTE HIGH SCHOOL

	A sprawling red-brick Gothic structure with many wings. It 
	is topped by church-like towers. It's scary.

	INT. GYM - NIGHT

	Martin and Debi enter and pause to take in the entire scene. 
	A benevolent Ronald Reagan hangs crookedly above. Basketball 
	nets are swung back, draped with crepe. Lights are half-low 
	and the music is loud. Alumni are dancing.

				  ARLENE
		Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott-
		Joseph.

				  MARTIN
		I'm Martin Blank.

				  DEBI
		Debi Newberry.

	Debi heads off into the gym, smiling back as she strands 
	Martin. Arlene rises from a card table. They have little to 
	say. Martin wasn't part of her crowd.

				  ARLENE
		Marty, you haven't changed a bit!

				  MARTIN
		Don't say that.

	Arlene gives him a NAMETAG. As a special torture, the tags 
	have YEARBOOK PHOTOS. Martin looks at the name tag 
	uncomfortably.

				  ARLENE
		We had pictures put on, that way 
		everybody knows who everybody was!

				  MARTIN
		Wonderful.

				  ARLENE
		So, what are you doing now?

				  MARTIN
		Whatever I can get away with.

	She smiles at his joke and is immediately distracted by the 
	next arrival. Martin moves off...

				  ARLENE
			(to the next person)
		Isn't it cute. It's so everybody 
		knows who everybody was!

	He circles the crowded gym. Looking for familiar faces. He 
	stops at the open bar.

				  BATENDER
		What can I make you?

				  MARTIN
		Beer.

	The bartender gets him a beer. Martin recognizes a guy at 
	the bar. He is well-appointed and shiny. He is KEN ALDRIDGE.

				  MARTIN
		Hey, Ken. How have you been?

				  KEN
			(glancing at Martin's 
			name tag)
		Hello Martin. How have you been?

				  MARTIN
		Not bad. You?

	Bob Destephano arrives next to them and orders a drink. Eye 
	contact is made.

				  KEN
		Hello, Bob.

				  MARTIN
		Hey, Bob.

	Bob turns slightly toward them. They continue in their 
	conversation.

				  KEN
		I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice 
		& Fromeyer.

				  MARTIN
		That sounds pretty interesting...

	Bob wants to join the conversation but doesn't know how.

				  KEN
		Sometimes. I'm in divorce, mainly. 
		Some property. Some personal injury.

				  MARTIN
		Those all seem kind of related...

	Bob takes another drink and mopes off, Martin watches him 
	go.

				  MARTIN
		Tragedy makes you thirsty.

	Ken chuckles. The bartender arrives with the bottle. Martin 
	grabs it and begins to move off.

				  MARTIN
		Well... I have to take this over to 
		Debi.

				  KEN
		Here. Take my card. Wait a minute... 
		here's a special one. For top-shelf 
		clients.

	Ken hands Martin a Monte Blanc pen with Ken's title and 
	business address printed on the shaft. Martin reads it and 
	puts it in his kerchief pocket.

				  MARTIN
		Thanks.

	Ken goes back to listening to the Guys at the bar.

	MARTIN

	makes his way through the upbeat crowd of well-wishers. TERRY 
	emerges like an inkspot on a clean white whirt, and intercepts 
	Martin. His angst is barely under control as he sidles up to 
	Martin.

				  TERRY
		I don't know, Blank, all these fucking 
		people, driving me crazy. Look at 
		them over there, memorializing old 
		times, acting all like it was 
		something "life-changing." And the 
		people in the National Honor Society? 
		The name tags?

	Martin shrugs.

				  TERRY
		They have special blue starts on 
		them like it fucking matters now 
		that they were in the honor club ten 
		years ago. I'm getting fucking 
		nauseous from all this sentimental 
		bullshit. It's making me sick.

	Terry stops suddenly as if he's finished. Martin reads this 
	man's nametag.

				  MARTIN
		Why are you here... Terry?

	Terry turns on a dime.

				  TERRY
		I wanted to see a couple people. But 
		I don't want to talk about the old 
		days... What did we have together, 
		Martin? Typing?

				  MARTIN
			(remembering)
		Drafting.

				  TERRY
		Yeah, I couldn't stand that fucking 
		class. But I appreciate you helping 
		me out, man.

				  MARTIN
		Don't mention it.

				  TERRY
		Yeah, thanks. Well I'm going to try 
		and get out of here, man. I'll see 
		you later.

	Terry slinks off.

	BAR - SAME

	Bob Destephano grabs two more scotches off the bar and turns 
	to leave, thoroughly morose. In his path, he finds DAN 
	KORETZKY, the good-looking side of brainy.

				  DAN
		Bob. Bob Destephano.

				  BOB
		What?

				  DAN
		I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky.

				  BOB
		Computer guy.

				  DAN
		Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's 
		dealership the other day.

				  BOB
		I sell BMW's. What do you do?

				  DAN
		Not much, actually. My software 
		company just went public so I'm 
		just... hanging out, really.

	There's a sudden lull in the conversation. Bob tries his 
	drunken hand at relating...

				  BOB
		Remember high school?

				  DAN
		Sure. Listen. Why don't you join us 
		up in the grandstands?

	Dan points up to a group of happy, laughing people. Bob walks 
	off shaking his head and smiling bitterly.

	INT. GYM - LATER

	Debi and Martin are seated at a round table with six others 
	in an area blocked off for dinner. Plates of gumbo are 
	arriving and the wine is poured. DARIUS, an African-American, 
	is in mid-conversation with AMY, who looks like she walked 
	out of a Laura Ashley catalog and sits on the other side of 
	Martin. DENNIS and MIKE are two suits in the midst of a non-
	stop sports conversation.

				  MIKE
		...You gotta hold the fans 
		responsible, though, Dennis, because 
		they're the ones putting up with the 
		mediocre product.

				  DENNIS
		I guess, though, you know, if you 
		look at it Mike, that park is a 
		beautiful park, I've gone to that 
		park many times - I've had the 
		greatest time of my life at that 
		ballpark and let's face it, I tell 
		you this, Mike, by the sixth inning, 
		if you're having the fun you should 
		be having at Tigers Stadium, you 
		don't even know what the hell's going 
		on anyway...

	They both crack up at this.

	ANGLE ON DARIUS, MARTIN, & DEBI

				  DARIUS
		Have you two been together since 
		high school?

				  DEBI
		No--

				  MARTIN
		--Yes. Actually we just bought that 
		little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine 
		Avenue... Debi's a social worker and 
		I mow down insurance claims at Aetna--

				  DEBI
		We haven't seen each other since 
		high school.

				  DARIUS
		I figured. You two look too happy 
		together. I shouldn't say that though, 
		I'm married... So, Martin-- what are 
		you up to these days? What do you do 
		for a living?

	Debi perks up; this should be interesting.

				  MARTIN
		I'm in pro-active international 
		relations. It's a very specialized 
		company. We execute economic 
		investment opportunities. Sort of 
		economic clean-up... with an emphasis 
		on personnel. It's boring, you know, 
		it's boring. I don't like to talk 
		about it because I don't think what 
		a man does necessarily reflects who 
		he is...

	Martin begins to draw strange looks from all over the table. 
	Martin may be in trouble.

				  MARTIN
		...I've always tried to refrain from 
		a black-and-white moral lexicon--you 
		know, good, bad, right, wrong--I've 
		been more interested in the gray 
		areas.

	Silence. Martin pushes on.

				  MARTIN
		But that's no way to live. I guess 
		you've got to just take the leap of 
		faith. Believe in something. Fuck 
		it.

				  DARIUS
		Sounds complicated, Martin. Are you 
		happy?

				  MARTIN
		I just have to close this one last 
		account. I'd like to just stop now, 
		today, but I can't... It's a step in 
		the right direction.

				  DEBI
		I don't know, Martin. It sounds like 
		you're feeling compromised. Live the 
		way you want. The only thing that's 
		inexcusable, to me, is cynicism. 
		That's the biggest cop-out there is.

	Nods of assent come from around the table. A brief silence, 
	and then...

				  AMY
		But wait. I still don't understand 
		what you do.

				  MARTIN
		I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.

	Debi suppresses a laugh.

				  AMY
		You do not.

				  MARTIN
		Yes I do.

				  AMY
		You don't...

				  MARTIN
		In the corporate offices.

				  AMY
		Oh... really?

				  MARTIN
		Yeah...

				  AMY
		What do you do?

				  MARTIN
		I sell biscuits to the Southland.

				  AMY
		You do not.

				  MARTIN
		It's what I do.

				  AMY
		You're so funny...

				  MARTIN
		I sell biscuits and gravy all over 
		the Southland--

				  AMY
		--Stop it--

				  MARTIN
		You know those horsey biscuit gravy 
		packets? I move all of those--

				  AMY
		--No.

				  MARTIN
		Sometimes we sell them to McDonald's 
		and just change them to special 
		barbecue sauce.

	Across the table from Martin and Debi, Dennis turns to Darius.

				  DENNIS
		What do you think about black coaching 
		in the NFL, Darius? Because I think 
		it's great.

				  DARIUS
		I don't pay much attention to 
		football.

				  MIKE
		I have to agree with you Dennis. 
		It's good to see that the owners are 
		willing to put the franchise behind 
		a black head coach or QB when for 
		years in the league they've been 
		kept out of the thinking positions 
		and relegated mainly to the physical 
		game.

				  DENNIS
		But now, you see, you have Warren 
		Moon at the helm, Cunningham, Art 
		Shell, and the coach up at 
		Minnesota...

				  MIKE
		Dennis Green. And if you remember, 
		Doug Williams was the first black 
		man to prove that on a Superbowl 
		Sunday.

	Amy leans in to Martin.

				  AMY
			(to Martin)
		I'm teaching art at Cedar Junior 
		High School.

				  DENNIS
		...Yeah, listen. Where do you stand 
		on this whole Louis Farrakhan 
		issue...?

				  DARIUS
			(facetious)
		I'm a De Klerk man myself.

	Debi nods, indicating to the deejay stand.

				  DEBI
		I'm going over to play some tunes.

	Martin watches her walk away.

	INT. GYM - GRANDSTANDS - LATER

	Dan Koretzky sits with two other FORMER-SQUARES-turned-
	handsome-fellas who now enjoy a confidence that comes with 
	early investment in Microsoft.

	Martin looks out over the milieu below, enjoying the seene. 
	He eavesdrops on a group of men from a few rows back.

	GROUP OF MEN

				  DAN
		Look at her. There it is. Jenny 
		Slater. The finest thing that ever 
		walked these halls.

				  FORMER-SQUARE #2
		I believe she married the state of 
		Maine.

				  DAN
		Yeah, he's around here somewhere. 
		What a shame. She would have looked 
		great in my fucking Bentley.

				  FORMER-SQUARE #3
		No, my friends, Jenny Beam. Not only 
		was she as fine, if not finer, than 
		Slater, but she had the "bad girl" 
		thing going for her. And the red 
		hair. C'mon.

				  DAN
		She's a paramedic in Skokie, Illinois.

				  FORMER-SQUARE #2
		You both are mistaken. Jenny Maretti 
		was the finest. No question about 
		it.

				  FORMER-SQUARE #3
		The three Jenny's. Three Jenny's. 
		All named Jenny...

				  DAN
		You know what I'm really hoping? 
		That Jenny Slater gets divorced. And 
		she's twenty-eight--

				  FORMER-SQUARE #3
		--she's got half the state of Maine--

				  DAN
		She's twenty-eight years old, with 
		two kids, she's still really really 
		fine, and I see her at a bookstore 
		or something, and she sees me for 
		what I was then, and what I am now: 
		the redemption for all her failure.

				  FORMER-SQUARE #3
		You mean the redemption for all your 
		failure.

	They ponder this. Martin looks down on the gym, concentrating 
	on Debi.

	BOB DESTEPHANO

	Dancing drunkenly, miserable, like an unbalanced orangutan.

								   CUT TO:

	INT. GYM - DEEJAY BOOTH - LATER

	Martin stands by Debi as she sits in for a set in the deejay 
	booth, on a raised stage. They are playing an old sophomoric 
	game.

				  DEBI
		Which would you rather...?

				  MARTIN
		Okay... Would you rather... commit 
		yourself sexually to a four-by-nine 
		cell with former President George 
		Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a 
		super-model for a month, or make 
		love to a otter on crank for a week?

				  DEBI
		Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, 
		clearly! I'd let the little beast 
		scratch and claw all he wants... 
		Okay. Would you rather make love to 
		the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--

				  MARTIN
		--She's not dead---

				  DEBI
		It's just a game...! Alright. Candied 
		Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest 
		across the desert with a fully 
		digested crab apple in your mouth?

				  MARTIN
		Wow. I have to give this some thought.

				  DEBI
		No time.

				  MARTIN
		Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller.

	STACEY breaks the moment, looking up at the two, horrified 
	and unsure at what she's heard.

				  STACEY
		Marty! Debi! How are you! So many 
		people came, but I never expected to 
		see you Marty. Or you Debi... I 
		mean... because of what your 
		divorce... I didn't mean to say that. 
		I just meant you look so good.

				  DEBI
		Thank you.

				  STACEY
		Do you think you could play "Too 
		Shy'" by Kaja Goo Goo?

				  DEBI
		Stacey, why don't you come up here 
		and take over for a little while?

				  STACEY
		I'd love to.

	Stacey nods thanks and makes her way up into the booth as 
	Martin and Debi make their way down.

				  DEBI
			(to Martin)
		Everybody thinks they know me now 
		that I'm divorced.

	She leads Martin toward the exit.

				  DEBI
		It's time to see you in private.

	INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY

	Martin and Debi walk down the hallway, alone together.

				  MARTIN
		Even though I left, you never left 
		me. Not just memory but a substance 
		in my blood.

				  DEBI
			(smiling)
		Like heroin?

				  MARTIN
		Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.

				  DEBI
			(enjoying this)
		Like love?

				  MARTIN
		Could be. The physical substance of 
		love.

	Debi stops.

				  DEBI
		I'll accept that. Follow me.

	Together they move into what appears to be the Nurse's Office, 
	and close the door behind them.

	INT. NURSE'S OFFICE

	Martin and Debi make wild banshee love.

	EXT. PARKING LOT - SAME

	Lardner and McCullers watch Felix into the gym.

				  MCCULLERS
		Looks like someone keeps trying to 
		do our job for us.

				  LARDNER
		If he does our job, he's our job.

				  MCCULLERS
		I get it.

	INT. GYM - SAME

	FELIX

	steps through the doorway he's standing in and strolls into 
	the crowded gym. He wears the standard khaki-pants-blue-blazer 
	combo, with no nametag. He's clearly too old for the class 
	of 1984.

	INT. HALLWAY - LATER

	Martin and Debi come out of the Nurse's Office. The post-
	coital mood is broken as they hear The Human League's "Don't 
	You Want Me, Baby?"  blasting from the gym. Martin and Debi 
	tune in on the song for a moment, unhappy at remembering 
	that particular moment in pop music history. Debi looks to 
	Martin, something must be done about it.

				  DEBI
		I'll be right back....

	Debi kisses him. They split up. Martin walks off, the happiest 
	we've seen him....

	INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY

	Bob and several others from the muscle-to-fat crew play a 
	drunken scrimmage with a papier-mache table ornament footbal 
	that is coming unwound. Bob quarterbacks and begins to recite 
	a long, complicated, and forgotten play. Martin approaches 
	from behind Bob and glides through the ad-hoc line-up, 
	continuing down the hall. Bob yells "hike" as he stares after 
	Martin, distracted. Bob's rushed upon and sacked. He lets 
	the papier-mache ball drop and crack on the floor.

	INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - LATER

	Martin walks down a silent, deserted hall of lockers and 
	classroom doors. The only sounds are his footsteps and the 
	echoed strains of Iggy Pop's "Wild Child" from the distant 
	gym. He stops at locker number 1963 and flips the dial: Right-
	back left-right again. It opens. He pops up the steel false 
	ceiling in the empty locker, fishes his hand in the opening, 
	and withdraws what he is looking for: an ancient joint. He 
	holds it up and examines the now brown and dried reefer. He 
	grinds it into dust in his hand.

	INT. HALLWAY

	Debi comes out of the gym and starts down the hall, the music 
	changed for the better.

	INT. HALLWAY - SAME

	Martin senses he is not alone. He turns to find Bob 
	Destephano. The big man holds a glass unsteadily and slurs 
	slightly when he speaks. Bob is looking sad and scary. He 
	leans into Martin

				  BOB
		So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that 
		shit again?

				  MARTIN
		Fine, Bob. How are you?

				  BOB
		Never better.

				  MARTIN
		Really?

	Bob crumbles.

				  BOB
		Ahhh... it's all fucked up. Nothing 
		adds up to nothing... you work your 
		whole life, day in and day out-- try 
		to make sense of it all. One day 
		you're twenty-seven and what do you 
		get to show for it...

				  MARTIN
		You could've been a contender, huh?

	Bob realizes he can't even express his own tragedy without 
	the use of cliches.

				  BOB
		Smart boy. Real smart. Let's see how 
		smart you are with my foot up your 
		ass! I'm gonna kick your ass!

	Martin steps to Bob.

				  MARTIN
		Why would you want to hit me, Bob? 
		Do you really believe that there's 
		some stored up conflict that needs 
		resolution between us? We don't exist. 
		There's nothing between us. So who 
		do you want to hit, Bob? It's not 
		me.

	Bob slumps against the lockers, deflated.

				  BOB
		What am I gonna do?

				  MARTIN
		What do you want to do?

				  BOB
		I want to be an actor.

				  MARTIN
		Then express yourself, Bob.

	Bob frowns, trying to think of a way to express himself.

				  MARTIN
			(catching him)
		Be honest...

	Bob backs up and lets out a huge, drunken caveman scream, 
	then stops abruptly, and smiles.

				  BOB
		Later, Martin.

	Bob backpedals down the hallway and out of sight. Martin 
	watches him stumble out of the hallway and bang through the 
	doors of a stairwell, disappearing.

	INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

	Bob slams through the doors and begins to stumble down the 
	stairs. He encounters Debi, on her way up. He glances at her 
	but does not break stride. Debi gives him wide berth, and 
	quickens her pace up the stairs...

	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Martin watches the doors swing to a stop. He exhales and 
	relaxes... AND THEN Spin-pivots on his right heel, as a BURST 
	from a silenced pistol pierces the space where his head was 
	a split-second before/ As he spins around, his right hand 
	withdraws Ken's give-away pen from his kerchief pocket, pops 
	the cap off, and drive the pen up and through the throat of 
	his attacker--

	FELIX

	impaled through the throat on the pen, his head snapped back.

	MARTIN AND FELIX

	are frozen for a moment. Blood runs quickly down the front 
	of Felix's body, off of his shoes, and on to the floor. The 
	stairwell doors band open. Martin's head turns toward the 
	sound. His eyes lock onto

	DEBI

	who is frozen, horrified for a moment. She flees.

	MARTIN

	looks back at

	FELIX

	Dead.

	THE FLOOR

	A growing pool of blood.

	MARTIN

	Looks around wildly, holding Felix up against the lockers. 
	Above the lockers is a plastic banner proclaiming

		 "SPANISH CLUB FIESTA FUN-RAISER SATURDAY JUNE 1"

	MARTIN

	rips it down from the wall with his free hand, wraps it around 
	Felix, stuffs the body into his open locker, and slams it 
	shut. He pulls off his shoes and socks, puts a sock over 
	each hand like mittens, and wipes up the small pool of blood. 
	He stuffs the socks into his pockets, takes off down the 
	hall, and bangs through the doors.

	INT. GYM - GRANDSTANDS - MOMENTS LATER

	Martin blasts through the upstairs doors to the grandstands 
	looking for Debi below. She is nowhere to be found. He scans 
	the party in progress-- It is the same frame of image as the 
	one in Oatman's office. In the middle of the floor, Terry 
	slowly turns up to meet Martin's eyes.

	MARTIN

	pulls the doors shut, and takes off down the hall.

	INT. HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

	Martin opens his locker, withdraws the corpse, and hefts it 
	over his shoulder.

	INT. STAIRWELL - A MINUTE LATER

	Brick-walled, darkly lit, and narrow. Martin bounds down the 
	steep steps with his load.

	INT. BASEMENT LOCKER ROOM HALLWAY - MINUTE LATER

	Martin hustles toward a cage door in front of him. He kicks 
	through it and dumps Felix into a canvas laundry cart on 
	casters and begins rolling.

	INT. PUMP AND FURNACE ROOM - A MINUTE LATER

	The door bangs open and light pours into the room from behind 
	Martin. He negotiates the cart over the dirt floor and stops 
	next to the furnace that heats the swimming pool. He pauses 
	and looks to the ceiling: the music from the reunion pulses 
	into the floor above him. Martin picks up a large metal bar 
	and works open the door on the hulking cast-iron furnace. A 
	white-hot blaze roars within.

	INT. GYM - NIGHT

	The party is winding down. A harried-looking Martin walks in 
	and looks around once more for Debi-- nothing.

	MARTIN'S POV

	of the Deejay booth. It is empty.

	He moves over to the bar and joins Ken Aldridge. He motions 
	to the bartender who opens a beer for him.

				  MARTIN
		Have you seen Debi Newberry?

				  KEN
		Nope.

	They both look around at the last of the reunion.

				  KEN
		The more things change, the more 
		they Goddamned well stay the same.

				  MARTIN
		I guess.

	Before Ken can get started again...

				  MARTIN
		Take care of yourself, Ken. Thanks 
		for the pen.

	Martin walks out of the gym.

	EXT. HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

	Paul is leaning against his Beemer, having a smoke.

				  PAUL
		What the hell happened to you?

				  MARTIN
		I was catching up with Bob Destephano.

				  PAUL
		As long as you had a good time.

	Beat. Martin scans the lot for sign of Debi.

				  PAUL
		What now? Chase the girl?

	There is a beat of silence. Nothing seems worth saying.

				  MARTIN
		It didn't work out.

				  PAUL
		That's too bad.

				  MARTIN
		I have to get my head back into my 
		work.

				  PAUL
		Work's good for the soul.

	Martin gets up to leave.

				  MARTIN
		When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.

				  PAUL
		See you in ten years.

	Paul watches him leave. He almost stops him, but thinks better 
	of it.

	INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - NIGHT

	Martin hunches over his briefcase that lays open on the bed.

	MARTIN PULLS

	THE DOSSIER from the briefcase. It's seal is broken, but the 
	contents remain enclosed... He withdraws the package and 
	dumps the contents on the bed. His face registers muted shock.

				  MARTIN
		Dumb fucking luck...

	THE CONTENTS

	include various photos of MR. NEWBERRY, Mr. Newberry with 
	Debi, and the house. The photos are mingled with official-
	looking papers including credit reports, medical records, 
	etc... Newberry's life.

	He cocks his head toward the door anticipating a... KNOCK. 
	He freezes, then plucks a gun tapped under a desk, and moves 
	toward the door, pointing. Halfway to the door, his face and 
	body slacken. He lobs the gun onto the bed. With everything 
	gone wrong, there is nothing left to defend. He goes to the 
	door and opens it, body relaxed, expecting a bullet...

	Debi moves past him into the room. She is completely calm.

				  DEBI
		He was trying to kill you, right!

				  MARTIN
		Yes.

				  DEBI
		Not the other way around...?

				  MARTIN
		No.

				  DEBI
		Is it something you've done?

				  MARTIN
		It's something I do...

	Beat.

				  MARTIN
		...Professionally...

	Beat.

				  MARTIN
		...About five years now.

				  DEBI
			(stunned)
		Get the fuck outta here.

				  MARTIN
		Seriously, when I left, I joined the 
		Army and took the service exam. They 
		found my psych results fit a certain 
		profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" 
		would be the best way to describe 
		it... I was loaned out to a CIA-
		sponsored program. It's called 
		"mechanical operations." We sort of 
		found each other...

				  DEBI
		You're a government spook?

	Martin says nothing.

				  MARTIN
		I was, but no... yes... I was before, 
		but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, 
		really. The idea of governments, 
		nations, it's mostly a public 
		relations theory at this point, 
		anyway. But I'll tell you something, 
		until about five months ago, I really 
		enjoyed my work.

				  DEBI
		Jesus Christ!

				  MARTIN
		Then I started losing my taste for 
		it. Which usually means your time is 
		up. But then I realized it was 
		something entirely different... I 
		started getting the sneaking, dark 
		suspicion that maybe there was... 
		meaning to life.

				  DEBI
		Okay. Great, Martin, that's just 
		great. Meaning to life... Mmm....

				  MARTIN
		Like, that there's a point? An organic 
		connection between all living things.

				  DEBI
		Let me help you along, Martin. You're 
		a sociopath!

				  MARTIN
			(defensive)
		A sociopath kills for no reason. I 
		kill for money.

				  DEBI
		You never could have kept this from 
		me.

				  MARTIN
		I was leaving.

				  DEBI
		That's probably a good idea.

				  MARTIN
		Will you come with me?

				  DEBI
		I'm staying here.

				  MARTIN
		What if I come back?

				  DEBI
		I'll hide.

	She goes for the door.

				  MARTIN
		Don't go.

	She stops at the door. Slowly, she turns.

				  DEBI
		You don't get to have me. You are a 
		monster, I'm a human being. We're 
		not going to mate.

				  MARTIN
		You don't understand...

				  DEBI
		That's because I speak human, and 
		you speak monster.

	Debi bolts out of the room. Martin is left alone.

	Martin looks over at his gear on the bed. After a beat, he 
	walks slowly over and surveys his tools. He picks up a 
	cleaning rag and begins to go over the weapons, absently 
	singing to himself...

				  MARTIN
		"What's up Doc? What's cookin'? What's 
		up Doc, are you lookin'...?

	INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - DAWN

	Morning light comes through the slit in the curtains, picking 
	up four or five exquisitely clean guns are laid out on the 
	bed, almost geometrically spaced. Martin lifts one at a time, 
	checking their bores and actions...

	INT. COUNTRY SQUIRE - MORNING

	Lardner and McCullers gear up. They each finish loading the 
	last of many clips...

	EXT. MICHIGAN HIGHWAY - MORNING

	Grocer and Company, not in a Ford Passenger Van, veer off 
	onto an exit ramp. Grocer has assembled a team of about nine. 
	They draw different guns from their kit bags and begin 
	loading...

	INT. COUNTRY SQUIRE - SAME

	Lardner and McCullers jam clips into their service autos and 
	knock the slides...

	INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - SAME

	Martin finished loading his guns, and puts them in his case. 
	He shuts it and moves for the door. On the way out he stops 
	and looks himself in the mirror before exiting.

	EXT. THREE DIFFERENT ROADS - INTERCUT

	Each car whooshes by camera, on its way to the inevitable...

	INT. EASTWEST HOLDING COMPANY - INTERCUT

	Marcella has a cordless tucked between her shoulder and ear, 
	and holds a two-gallon gas can. She moves from room to room 
	pouring gasoline onto the computers, desks, and piles of 
	paper stacked on the floor. She adds a splash to her copy of 
	"Women Who Run With the Wolves."

				  MARCELLA
		I'm bringing down the office now.

	She picks up her hard drive and smashes it on the floor. 
	It's cathartic.

	INTERCUT WITH MARTIN IN THE TOWN CAR -

				  MARTIN
		I'll put things right. Then I'll 
		find you.

	Silence on the line.

				  MARCELLA
			(apprehensive)
		Uh... why?

	Martin finishes his weapons check, and pulls out the dossier.

				  MARTIN
		Don't worry. I left you a little 
		something under your desk.

	Martin hangs up.

	Marcella goes to it and pulls loose from underneath a shrink-
	wrapped brick of $100 bills, probably a $100,000 or so.

				  MARCELLA
		All right!!

	INT. MARTIN'S TOWN CAR

	Martin makes his way down the road to the Newberry's. In the 
	distance, he sees a lone figure jogging on the shoulder, 
	away from him.

	INT. GROCER'S VAN - SAME

	Grocer and Company are parked off to the side, watching 
	Newberry, in the distance, jog toward them. A SNIPER prepares 
	to blow Newberry's head off.

	INT. MARTIN'S TOWN CAR - SAME

	As he approaches the figure, he recognizes it as Newberry, 
	he accelerates.

	INT. GROCER'S VAN - SAME

	Grocer spots Martin's car speeding at Newberry.

				  GROCER
		Oh shit...

	EXT. ROAD - SAME

	Newberry stops jogging and turns to face the Town Car bearing 
	down on him. His face goes slack, expecting to be creamed.

	INT. TOWN CAR - SAME

	Martin roars straight at Newberry, his engine shrieking. As 
	the distance between them turns from yards to feet... Martin 
	swerves hard, just missing Newberry and comes to a halt next 
	to him, blocking the Sniper's line of fire. After a moment, 
	Newberry opens the passenger door.

				  NEWBERRY
		What the fuck is the matter with 
		you?!

				  MARTIN
		Well, I was hired to kill you. It's 
		what I do, and come to think of it, 
		I told you that, but... Okay. I'm 
		not going to do it. Get in the car.

	He does. They drive on.

				  MARTIN
		It's either because I'm in love with 
		your daughter, or because I have a 
		new-found respect for life. Or both. 
		But I don't know.

	INT. GROCER'S VAN - SAME

	Grocer and company watch in amazement.

	GROCER'S P.O.V.

	of Martin's car disappearing into Newberry's long and wooded 
	driveway.

				  GROCER
		That punk is either in love with 
		that guy's daughter or he has new 
		found respect for life... Let's go.

	EXT. NEWBERRY HOUSE - SAME

	Martin pulls up in front and stops. Both men scramble out 
	and head toward the front door at a quick clip. Newberry is 
	shaken; Martin seems at ease, at home in his element.

				  NEWBERRY
		Why? I build cars! They're paying 
		you to kill me? Why?

				  MARTIN
		It was a cost-cutting effort. They 
		can't afford a recall.

				  NEWBERRY
		It was a leaky sunroof! A design 
		flaw! I reported a leaky sunroof! 
		You want to kill me because of that?

				  MARTIN
		It's not me! Why does everybody think 
		it's personal?!

	They go through the front door and shut it behind them.

	INT. GROCER'S VAN - SAME

	Grocer drops the van into gear and heads toward the driveway.

	INT. COUNTRY SQUIRE - SAME

	Lardner and McCullers approach the scene. They get within 
	viewing distance in time to see Grocer's Town Car turn into 
	the driveway.

				  LARDNER
		We'll go in through the woods.

	INT. NEWBERRY HOUSE

	Martin's briefcase is open on the large oak table. The 
	contents of the dossier are spilled out onto the table. 
	Newberry and Debi watch him, dumbstruck, as he draws a huge 
	Desert Eagle automatic and jerks back the slide. He turns to 
	Debi.

				  MARTIN
		I was sitting in my house on prom 
		night wearing that Goddamned rented 
		tuxedo, a corsage in one hand, a 
		bottle of champagne in the other. So 
		I was just sitting there, and then 
		the whole night flashed before my 
		eyes, and it struck me like a bullet 
		in the head-- I realized, finally, 
		and for the first time, that... I 
		wanted to kill somebody. So I figured 
		because I loved you so much, that'd 
		it'd be a good idea if I didn't see 
		you anymore. But now I'm different.

	He turns and points the gun at the front door and FIRES two 
	shots through it, leaving two baseball-size holes in the 
	door.

	Martin bolts out of the room toward the back of the house. 
	Debi and Newberry run as fast as they can away from Martin. 
	Newberry opens the front door, preparing to rush out with 
	Debi. They stop at what they see:

	NEWBERRY'S & DEBI'S P.O.V.

	As ASSASSIN lies on the porch, shot dead through the door by 
	Martin. IN one hand is a gun, in the other is a Fuller Brush 
	kit. Two men, GROCER and an ASSASSIN, clamber out of van, 
	their guns rising up fast toward us.

	Debi pulls Newberry inside, slams the front door, and locks 
	it. They dive away just before ten rounds hit the door from 
	outside.

	INT. KITCHEN - SAME

	Martin rushes toward the back door which is already opening. 
	A barrel comes through and FIRES at Martin. Martin pulls 
	back behind the refrigerator and returns FIRE. An ASSASSIN 
	comes through the door in a crouch and takes cover behind 
	the cooking island. Martin, yelling back to Debi...

				  MARTIN
		I'm in love with you. I know we can 
		make this work!

	MARTIN

	rushes toward the island, grabbing an iron skillet off the 
	range, and holds it up like a crossing-guard stop sign. He 
	steps toward the hidden Assassin just as the Assassin rises 
	SHOOTING. The skillet takes two rounds before Martin hammers 
	the Assassin's head with it. Debi and Newberry arrive in the 
	kitchen.

	NEW ANGLE - LOW DUTCH

	Martin bashes the skillet into the Assassin's skull, which 
	is beyond our view. He rises spattered with blood and looks 
	at Debi.

				  MARTIN
		I was afraid to commit to a 
		relationship, but now I know I'm 
		ready to make it happen.

	Martin drops the skillet and grabs Newberry and Debi gently 
	be the wrists.

				  MARTIN
		I just need time to change.

	He ushers them past the bludgeoned corpse and up the back 
	stairs. He spins and FIRES twice back down the stairs at 
	another ASSASSIN coming up, blowing his arms off.

	HALLWAY

	He leads them quickly.

				  MARTIN
		It's not easy for me. I was raised 
		to close off, to control my 
		feelings...

	He takes them into a bedroom, and BLOWS AWAY, an ASSASSIN 
	coming in through the window, emptying his auto. Martin pushes 
	Debi and Newberry into an adjoining bathroom. He backs out 
	through the doorway.

				  MARTIN
		Lock the door.

	They do. Martin starts away, but stops to get something 
	straight.

				  MARTIN
		I wasn't raised in a loving 
		environment.
			(beat)
		But that's not an excuse. It's a 
		reason.

	INT. FOYER

	Martin corners the banister and springs half-way down the 
	stairs, then hears the front door begin to open.

				  MARTIN
		My soul was empty--

	Martin jams in another clip, and chambers a round. He sees 
	Grocer beginning to slip in.

				  MARTIN
		--and it's up to me to fill it.

	Martin FIRES the twelve-round clip into the door until the 
	slide locks back empty again. Grocer backs out fast. Martin 
	hears a gun REPORT from upstairs and moves back toward it, 
	tossing the spent weapon.

	INT. BEDROOM

	An ASSASSIN slams his body against the bathroom door while 
	Debi and Newberry scream from within. Martin flies at him. 
	The Assassin wheels on Martin FIRING. Martin pivots out of 
	the line of fire, still moving forward. He takes hold of 
	Assassin's neck and snaps it. Martin drops the corpse.

				  MARTIN
			(through the door)
		It's okay. It's Martin The door begins 
		to open revealing Debi and Newberry.

				  MARTIN
		I know what I do isn't moral, per 
		se, but if you could just look past 
		that, you'd see a man worth loving.

				  GROCER (O.S.)
		Don't listen to him, he's a 
		professional.

	Martin stops short and cocks his head toward Grocer's muffled 
	voice coming from the vent. Grocer continues...

				  GROCER (O.S.)
		You're breaking my heart down here, 
		Blank. I can't shoot through the 
		tears.

	Martin, incensed, bends down and takes the gun from the dead 
	man. He runs out of the bedroom, gun poised for a kamikaze 
	firefight...

	EXT. NEWBERRY HOUSE - SAME

	Lardner and McCullers are poised outside the front door, 
	about to enter the mix. McCullers peers through the window.

				  LARDNER
		Did you see Blank in there?

				  MCCULLERS
		No...

				  LARDNER
		Good. For a second there I thought 
		we were in trouble.

	INT. NEWBERRY FOYER - CONTINUOUS

	MARTIN

	reaches the top of the front stairs to find Grocer heading 
	up the stairs at him. They lift their guns at each other to 
	FIRE, when they hear...

	LARDNER AND MCCULLERS

	power through the front door, guns BLAZING at floor-level, 
	ala Butch and Sundance.

	Martin and Grocer, above, spin on them instinctively, and 
	FIRE, killing them. Grocer dives off of the stairs and rolls 
	out of view.

	KITCHEN - INTERCUT

	GROCER

	heads up the back stairs.

	MARTIN

	works his way toward Grocer, moving with stealth toward the 
	kitchen.

	GROCER

	hears him and starts back down.

	Martin dives behind the cooking island just as Grocer comes 
	out of the stairwell blasting. They unload at each other as 
	Grocer runs a pattern across the kitchen, FIRING at Martin, 
	crouched, who BLASTS back. Grocer vaults himself through the 
	air toward a serving window from the kitchen to the dining 
	room, still firing.

	C.U. - MARTIN'S GUN - SLOW MOTION

	The last casing floats out of the chamber into the air, and 
	the slide on the auto locks back-- empty.

	NORMAL SPEED

	GROCER

	Flying through the air disappearing through the shuttered 
	serving window, his flight carrying him past a television 
	that sits on a lazy susan.

	MARTIN AND GROCER - INTERCUT

	Martin and Grocer sit on the floor, backs up against opposite 
	side of the counter-- Martin in the kitchen and Grocer in 
	the dining room. The hulking old television sits on the 
	counter above and between them.

	Martin looks up and spies the TELEVISION

				  GROCER
		...How about I sell you two rounds 
		for a hundred grand a piece?

				  MARTIN
		Okay.

	Martin takes out a checkbook, and tears one free. He wads it 
	into a loose ball and tosses it over the counter.

	BALLED CHECK

	sails over the television and comes down, bouncing off 
	Grocer's head and into his lap.

				  MARTIN
		There you go. I left it blank.

				  GROCER
		Excellent. Here they come.

	Grocer pulls two rounds from the clip of his semi-automatic 
	and pushes the clip back into the gun. Grocer arcs the TWO 
	BULLETS into the air.

	MARTIN

	rises and springs at the television, gripping it. The TWO 
	BULLETS sail past his head.

	GROCER

	begins to rise from his side of the counter, cocking his 
	gun.

	MARTIN

	puts all his weight and motion behind the television. Martin 
	and the television careen off of the counter toward Grocer.

	GROCER

	gets off one round before

	MARTIN

	flies onto Grocer, smashing the seventy-five pound television 
	over his Goddamn head. Martin sails past the collision, 
	landing on his back in the dining room. He rolls over to see

	GROCER

	Body crumpled, neck is snapped, head encased in the shattered 
	picture tube. He is dead.

	MARTIN

	runs up the front stairs, retrieving the spent gun he 
	discarded earlier, and heads into the bedroom.

	INT. BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

	Martin opens the bathroom door. Inside, Debi sits on the 
	edge of the tub, her face in her hands. Newberry kneels with 
	his arms around her. Martin takes this in, and walks back 
	into the bedroom. Newberry stands and follows him out.

	MARTIN AND NEWBERRY

	MARTIN a bloody, tattered mess, wipes off the gun and puts 
	it into Newberry's hand. Newberry, in total shock, grips it. 
	Martin looks past Newberry.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	Of Debi, head in hands.

				  MARTIN (V.O.)
		Debi... will you marry me?

	Debi doesn't look up. After a moment, she reaches out, head 
	still down, and closes the bathroom door...

	INT. RADIO STATION - DAY

	Outside is a Michigan autumn. Debi sits at her console, 
	bringing in the mike as she fades out of a tune...

				  DEBI
		This is WRFN Radio Free Newberry 
		cause that's what it does. Bringing 
		you New Ones for the Nineties, a 
		fresh new format designed to pull 
		you out of what's come before, and 
		reel you into what's coming soon--

	THE PHONE CONSOLE

	lights up with an incoming cal...

				  DEBI
		I tell you what's coming soon for 
		me, or at least what I dreamed this 
		morning in that weird time just before 
		you actually wake up. But first this 
		commercial. Back after this...

	She pushes a couple of buttons, slaps a cartridge in a player, 
	and answers the phone. We hear the commercial over the studio 
	monitor:

				  ANNOUNCER
		Don't miss the show of the season at 
		Bilkin Community Center! "Brigadoon!" 
		A musical for all ages! "Brigadoon," 
		starring Carol Plummer, Thomas 
		Canchola, Bob Destephano, and Lee 
		Ordman!...

	Debi picks up the phone.

				  DEBI
		RFN...

	Her face goes slack as she listens... not good, not bad... 
	Then she hangs up slowly. The commercial ends. A moment of 
	dead air, then she snaps to.

				  DEBI
		Hey out there... Okay... I'm going 
		to finish up that fantasy later. 
		First I'll give you an hour of nonstop 
		music... If I don't come back on 
		after that-- well, nevermind.

	Debi turns on a reel-to-reel, and leaves.

	EXT. FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT HOUSE - DAY

	Debi pulls up and gets out. She begins toward the door but 
	stops dead when she sees

	MARTIN

	sitting on the front steps.

	Debi moves slowly up the walk and sits next to him on the 
	porch. They sit, gazing out over the grass and trees beyond. 
	After a while...

				  DEBI
		This will never work out.

	She turns to him, serious.

				  DEBI
		You kill people.
			(beat)

				  MARTIN
		I have no illusions about the future. 
		What is, is. We make choices. And we 
		become the sum total of our choices. 
		I can live with that.

				  DEBI
		Other people can't.

	Martin looks at her earnestly... And smiles ever so slightly. 
	She does the same, and then just a little wider. He the same. 
	They turn back out to face the lawn, and they share a laugh...

	FADE IN:

	ROLL CREDITS OVER:

	EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAWN

	VARIOUS EXTRA CLOSE-UPS of this luxurious patchwork of 
	brilliant greens:

	A POLISHED BRASS SPRINKLER HEAD

	pops up from the ground and begins to water the already dew-
	soaked lawn.

	FLEET OF DUCKLINGS

	No mother in sight, cruise through the thrushes.

	GRAVEYARD OF GOLF BALLS, UNDERWATER

	At the bottom of a water hazard.

	PALM FRONDS

	After a neat they sway, revealing the barren desert that 
	surrounds the artificial oasis. The sun already bakes the 
	air. We hear the opening guitar strains of the Kim Deal-Kurt 
	Cobain suet of "WHAT I DID FOR LOVE," as we CRANE DOWN the 
	palms to

	A BRAND-NEW TITLEIST 3 BALL.

	Just on the edge of the rough. A pair of yellow trousers 
	moves in. An iron confidently addresses the ball, and chips 
	it out. The trousers walk out after it.

	HANDS

	Digging dirt out of the grooves of the iron's face with a 
	golf tee, while on the way to the green. Both hands are 
	gloved, instead of one, and the gloves are black.

	YELLOW TROUSERS

	In a squat over the ball, sizing up the curvy, fifty-foot 
	journey to the hole. The figure positions himself and the 
	putter above the ball, then pops the ball lightly. The ball 
	rolls and bobs with purpose toward the hole, dodging hazards 
	and finding lanes, until it finally falls off of the green 
	and into the hole.

	THE GLOVED HAND

	Sets the ball on the next tee. The figure moves to a leather 
	golf bag. The hands pull the wipe rag off of the top of the 
	bag and drop it on the ground, reach into the bag, drawing 
	out a compact SNIPER RIFLE, affixed with a long silencer. 
	The figure drops one knee down onto the rag, the other foot 
	firmly setting its spikes. We move the figure to see the 
	face of the sniper, concentrating down the scope in his half-
	squat. He is MARTIN BLANK.

	We SWING AROUND behind his head to look down the barrel with 
	him. Four-hundred yards away, on another part of the course, 
	another green is barely visible through groves of trees and 
	rough. Three miniscule, SILVER-HAIRED FIGURES come into view. 
	One of them, in a RED SWEATER sets up for first putt. He 
	could be an investment banker, or an arms trader.

	MARTIN'S ARM

	Flinches, and a low THUNK reports from the rifle. A second 
	later in the distance, the

	RED SWEATER'S HEAD

	Seems to vanish from his shoulders into a crimson mist. His 
	body crumples to the green.

	MARTIN

	Returns the rifle to the bag, pulls out a driver, moves to 
	the tee and whacks the ball. He watches its path and whispers 
	absently...

				  MARTIN
		Hooked it. 

	INT. CLUB HOUSE PATIO - LATER

	The outdoor post-golf luncheon area of an elite Texas golf 
	club. Martin sits in on the fringes of a conversation between 
	a group of executive types. CLUB MEMBER #1 has a Buddha-like 
	peace in his eyes through the philosophical talk.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		I'd come to the realization that 
		everything I'd based my life on was 
		false. And that my life had no 
		meaning.

				  CLUB MEMBER #2
			(to Martin)
		He gets this way when he hits over 
		eighty-five.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		It seemed like my life was slipping 
		away, somehow. I was a knot in the 
		middle of a wet rope. Everything was 
		futile and nothing had value.

				  CLUB MEMBER #3
		That's the way life is. The only 
		meaning and value is what we create. 
		Through structure, and discipline. 
		Though they seem to limit our freedom, 
		they actually give us great comfort. 
		Your problem is you're looking for 
		some great answer. Some ultimate 
		truth. When what you really should 
		do is go to work and go home.

				  CLUB MEMBER #2
		And take golf lessons.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		That's a tragedy. Can I finish my 
		story please? I began my search for 
		meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, 
		Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I 
		went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, 
		herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, 
		and a psychic. And they all pretty 
		much say the same stuff.

				  CLUB MEMBER #2
		A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are 
		telling you the same thing? You're 
		insane.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		Basically the same thing. In a very 
		evolved, esoteric way.

				  CLUB MEMBER #2
		Insane.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		To make a long story short...

				  CLUB MEMBER #3
		--Thank God--

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		...at last I found the holistic system 
		of systems that opened up the doors 
		of heaven for me right here on earth. 
		And everyday I see the world through 
		the eyes of a child. A world of 
		creation and wonder.

				  CLUB MEMBER #2
		Jesus...

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		Overflowing with love.

				  MARTIN
		Tell me about it.

	Club Member #1 turns to Martin.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		P.P.P. Personal Pan Power. All the 
		secrets of your universe are divided 
		up into eight easily digestible 
		slices.

	Club Member #1 pulls a laminated card from his wallet and 
	hands it over to Martin. In the distance, sirens begin to 
	wail.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		See, see. It's in the accessible and 
		everyday shape of a pan pizza. Each 
		day you have a little slice of 
		peace...

	INSERT - WALLET-SIZE P.P.P. CARD

	A pizza-shaped diagram showing six "sections".

				  MARTIN
		Oh I see. You got your individual 
		slices of hope, dignity, confidence, 
		self-love, justice, and harmony.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		You open 'em up and there's the 
		sayings, stories, little bites of 
		insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day 
		Week.

				  MARTIN
		So you eat-- read it everyday?

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		Yes.

				  MARTIN
		And these pan pizzas have opened up 
		the doors to heaven?

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		Correct.
			(re: the card)
		That's for you. Keep it.

	Sirens are getting louder, closer to the club.

	EXT. COUNTRY CLUB - DAY

	The source of the sirens are almost upon us. Martin walks 
	toward his rented Town Car as the VALET pulls it up. He meets 
	the Valet by the trunk, where he trades tip for keys.

				  MARTIN AT CAR
		He fishes out the laminated "Personal 
		Pan Power" card, looks at it, and 
		tosses it onto the ground. Police 
		cars, now visible in the distance, 
		wind into the long club driveway. 
		Martin gets into his car and pulls 
		away.

	LAMINATED CARD

	As it lays on the asphalt. The wheel of a police car rolls 
	to a stop on it.

	INT. AIRLINER - DAY

	Martin sits in a first class seat, the tray table flipped 
	down. On the left side of the tray is a stack of magazines 
	of all kinds - Sports Illustrated, Mademoiselle, Wired, 
	Rolling Stone, National Review, Spin, National Geographic, 
	and on. He draws one off the top, and flips through it, 
	impassively taking in images and reading nothing. When he is 
	done with one, he discards it into the empty seat next to 
	him and draws another-- Martin's way of instantly and 
	massively uploading the world around him:

	Toothless hockey player in triumph, Sony product parade, 
	crouched starving child with vulture in the background, 
	supermodel in suede, Tic Tacs, living former Presidents, arm 
	in arm, smiling, etc.

	INT. HIRED CAR, NEW YORK - DAY

	The livery weaves out of the arrival lanes at Kennedy airport. 
	Martin reclines in the back seat, a conversation having 
	already begun.

				  DRIVER
		How was your day, today, sir?

				  MARTIN
		Effective. But to tell you the truth, 
		I've lost my passion for work.

				  DRIVER
		Do you like the people you work with?

				  MARTIN
		I work alone.

				  DRIVER
		That's it then. That's it. I've always 
		been alone. That's why I'm a good 
		driver. I can handle it. See, I can 
		think on my feet. I survive, I'm a 
		thinker. And I can sit there in front 
		of your house for two hours and it 
		don't bother me. Some people can't 
		do it! Some people are ranting and 
		raving, "Tell them fuckin' people to 
		get out here and get in this car, I 
		can't-- I want a go!" Where you gonna 
		go? You're gonna wind up back in 
		your garage at seven o'clock at night. 
		You ain't going nowhere. You leave 
		your house in the morning you get 
		back to your house in the evening. 
		What's the big deal, right?

				  MARTIN
		You understand the psychology of the 
		job.

				  DRIVER
		I do. Some guys can't adjust to it; 
		they can't handle it.

	INT. CAR - MANHATTAN STREETS - LATER

	The car cuts through the upper east side. Martin and the 
	Driver exchange looks through the rear-view mirror.

				  DRIVER
		You look like you're far away. Far 
		away and thinking about other things. 
		I'm right about that, aren't I?

				  MARTIN
		No.

				  DRIVER
		Well, let's just say that sometimes 
		I'm right. Sometimes you are.

				  MARTIN
		Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only 
		natural.

				  DRIVER
			(laughs to himself at 
			this great truth)
		It's only natural....

	The Driver pauses for dramatic emphasis

				  DRIVER
		I been looking at you, and I've 
		decided that I want to share something 
		with you.

				  MARTIN
		Okay.

				  DRIVER
		Because your problem is you're bored. 
		And you have a very big mind.
			(beat)
		I am part of what I call a brain 
		syndicate.

	No reaction from Martin.

				  DRIVER
		I am part of a network of minds, a 
		group of five people who are all 
		connected, over hundreds, even 
		thousands of miles, through the mind. 
		We can think with each other, think 
		for each other. I can be driving 
		somewhere, sleeping with a woman-- 
		whatever it is-- and at the same 
		time be thinking a thought in someone 
		else's mind, far away. Running someone 
		else's brain.

				  MARTIN
			(indicates)
		Up on the right.

				  DRIVER
		And when you think of it, it's not 
		so surprising that a small group of 
		people control the whole world, is 
		it?

	INT. HOTEL ROOM, NEW YORK CITY - DAY

	A sedate and well-appointed four-star suite on the Upper 
	East Side. Martin stands in front of one of the open windows 
	watching the canopied entrance of an elegant high-rise across 
	the street. He lifts an eye rinse cup to his eye and tilts 
	it back. A cellular phone RINGS, interrupting him. He moves 
	to the desk and draws one of three phones from his briefcase, 
	depresses a scrambler module, flips it open, and listens for 
	a moment.

				  MARTIN
		If it's not there, I can't proceed. 
		Tell them.

	Martin hangs up. Picks up another phone and dials. As he 
	waits for an answer, he goes to a Fed Ex blueprint tube lying 
	on the bed.

				  MARTIN
		Tom. I've been waiting for an answer. 
		I'm only in town tonight.

	He breaks the shipping seal and pulls out a series of finished 
	metal parts including a long thin barrel, a scope, and a 
	silencer.

				  MARTIN
		What's different this time than the 
		last time? I have to be down front...

	INT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME

	Martin stands in front of the window, phone in one hand, the 
	scope in the other. Next to him, the assembled rifle rests 
	across the arm of a chair.

				  MARTIN
		...I don't bother to call anyone 
		else because you always take care of 
		me.

	He glances over to a second window to his left, which offers 
	a view further down the street. He goes to it. He raises the 
	scope and sees

	MARTIN'S P.O.V./SCOPE- WINDOW #2

	A few blocks down, small even through the high-powered scope, 
	is your average BICYCLE MESSENGER dressed in lycra racing 
	gear, weaving through traffic toward us. Slung low across 
	his right hip is a black canvas bag. The Messenger's hand is 
	hidden in it. The other phone begins to RING.

				  MARTIN
		Hold on a second, Tom. I got my hands 
		full here.

	He sets down the phone and answers the other, still watching 
	the messenger.

				  MARTIN
		Good. Account number 3649367, transfer 
		to account number 96-546-38739-47825. 
		Ask for Mr. Sanchez, tell him it's 
		Mr. Duckman. If there are any 
		problems, access file 673594638-IO-
		98, and look at it.

	Martin drops the phone and moves away from Window #2 to the 
	rifle. He mounts the scope and he looks out Window #1 at the 
	high-rise.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V./SCOPE - WINDOW #1

	Of a DOORMAN opening the door for a group of five men in 
	suits. Four BODYGUARDS form a perimeter around the fifth 
	man, a mall, avuncular figure in his forties dressed in 
	Saville Row finery.

	MARTIN

	Takes a step back into the shadows of the room, and raises 
	the rifle toward Window #2.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V./SCOPE - WINDOW #2

	of an empty street. The bicycle messenger flashes past.

	MARTIN

	concentrating, tracks the path of the Messenger, leading him 
	left to right across the blind spot of the hotel room wall 
	between Window #2 and Window #1.

	STREET

	the bicycle Messenger bears down on the group of men, drawing 
	a Mac-10 submachine gun from his bag. The group see him-- 
	just as Martin's sniper FIRE explodes the Messenger's chest. 
	Two of the Bodyguards collapse onto their boss. The other 
	two open fire on the Messenger as he wipes out horribly into 
	a parked car in front of them.

	MARTIN

	withdraws from the window, and picks up the phone again and 
	begins to break down the rifle.

				  MARTIN
		Sorry Tom. But look, I know it's the 
		playoffs. That's why I'm offering a 
		thousand dollars for one seat...

	Martin listens patiently as he works.

	EXT. STREET - SAME - INTERCUT

	DOORMAN'S HANDS

	unbuttoning his double-breasted long coat.

	MARTIN

	just finishes packing.

				  MARTIN
		...Well let me ask you, Tom. What do 
		I have to do to get courtside tickets 
		for the Knicks...?

	STREET

	The two bodyguards kick at the Messenger's body. The other 
	two begin to move off of their boss, who rises cowering. The 
	Doorman stands behind it all, unbuttoning his coat.

	DOORMAN

	a tall, dark, sharp-featured man in his forties, wearing a 
	handlebar moustache. He moves toward the group of men as he 
	flips open his coat back over two huge chrome .44 Magnum 
	Charthouse Bulldog revolvers and OPENS FIRE on them.

	MARTIN

	is closing his bag when he hears the gun-thunder.

				  MARTIN
		Never mind. I gotta go.

	Martin drops the phone, grabs his scope, and spins to the 
	window.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V./SCOPE

	of the Doorman kicking through the pile of dead bodyguards. 
	He gets to the man at the bottom-- their boss. The Doorman 
	FIRES both guns.

	MARTIN

	reacts, surprised to see a second shooter. He pulls himself 
	from the window, puts away his scope, and accelerates his 
	exit.

	HIGH-RISE FOYER

	Outside, we see the doorman drop both guns on the pile of 
	bodies. He walks back toward us through the glass doors and 
	makes his way through the building toward the service exit. 
	He sheds his uniform and stuffs it into a plastic bag.

	MARTIN

	his two parcels in hand, exits out the side door of the hotel 
	and walks down the street.

	DOORMAN

	now wearing rich man's sweats, hops off the loading dock, 
	walks to a Lincoln Town Car, and drives off.

	INT. MARTIN'S AND GROCERS CARS - DAY

	Martin rolls down FDR Drive in a Lincoln Town Car once again 
	on the cellular.

				  MARTIN
		...Tell them that's not my problem. 
		I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- 
		not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella.

				  MARCELLA
		Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.

				  MARTIN
		Patch him through....

	Martin notices another Town Car appears in the next lane. We 
	recognize the Doorman behind the wheel, phone in hand. He is 
	GROCER.

				  MARTIN
		What do you want?

				  GROCER
		I'm setting up a concern that would 
		enable those of us in our rarefied 
		profession to consolidate our efforts.

				  MARTIN
		Like a union?

				  GROCER
		Like a club. Work less, make more.

				  MARTIN
		Thank you, no.

				  GROCER
		We could be working together, making 
		big money, killing important people... 
		I'm willing to let you in on the 
		ground floor.

				  MARTIN
		And you could be... sort of like... 
		a father figure to me....

	Grocer ignores this.

				  GROCER
		It's a free-market evolution. You'll 
		wake up to it... c'mon Kid. We used 
		to run together when you were a 
		rookie. I don't want to run against 
		you. This thing's real. Everybody's 
		in.

				  MARTIN
		Not me. So don't paw at me with your 
		dirty little guild.

				  GROCER
		I'm gonna get you, kid.

	Martin hangs up and pulls away.

	INT. AIRLINER - DAY

	Martin sits in first class, wiping his face and hands with 
	an airline hot towel. He folds the wet cloth and once again 
	speeds through the images from a thick stack of magazines. 
	He looks up as he hears PILOT V.O.  It's seventy-six degrees 
	and partly cloudy in Chicago this afternoon...

	INT. APARTMENT, CHICAGO - NIGHT

	Martin walks into a sparsely furnished apartment. He wearily 
	drops his carry-on bag and briefcase in the hall.

	INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

	Martin sits on a futon couch watching MTV with no sound. On 
	the coffee table in front of him is a phalanx of vitamin 
	bottles. Martin takes some capsules from each and washes 
	them down with a reddish-orange beverage.

	INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

	Martin lies on his back on the hardwood floor. His eyes are 
	closed and he wears a set of headphones as he absently taps 
	his chest.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		"Dear Alumni: Can you believe it's 
		been ten years? Where are you now...?

	After a moment, his eyes open, alerted. His head turns to 
	the side, and his hands lightly cup the headphones.

	CLOSE-UP: WIRE

	from the headphones as it winds to a small metal box, with 
	one unmarked switch and one amber light- definitely not a 
	walkman. The wire continues out of the other side of the 
	box, across the floor, connecting to a suction cup stuck to 
	the floor.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...Are you guiding an Outward Bound 
		canoe trip like Brook Stinson? Or 
		perhaps in charge of appearances for 
		the NFL like Leslie Gunther....?

	MARTIN - A MINUTE LATER

	draws a pre-cut section of the floor, the width of a pencil 
	and twice as long, by a string.

	VIDEO MONITOR - A MINUTE LATER

	The greenish Starlight (night vision) image of a young, HUSKY 
	MAN sleeping on his back, as seen from above. A fine thread 
	snakes from behind CAMERA to just above the man's slack mouth. 
	We PULL BACK to reveal a Sony Watchman that holds the IMAGE. 
	KEEP PULLING to reveal Martin watching it as he maneuvers 
	the thread down past the fiber-optic cable through the hole 
	in the floor.

	MARTIN - A MINUTE LATER

	concentrates as he applies three drops of blue liquid on the 
	thread. As the drops run down along the thread through the 
	floor, his attention shifts to the

	VIDEO MONITOR

	The drops, huge in the foreground, become smaller as they 
	make their way down the line toward the sleeping man.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...Could it be that you're like Chip 
		Longfellow, at the trade-relations 
		tank in Washington. Sandy Glasser 
		owns a cheese shop...!

	MARTIN

	adjusts the thread minutely with one hand, and lowers the 
	fiber-optic cable with the other.

	VIDEO MONITOR

	The face begins to fill the screen as the fiber-optic follows 
	the drops toward it. Suddenly, the man snorts and turns his 
	face...

	A DROP FALLS

	It misses the man's mouth and hit's his cheek.

	VIDEO MONITOR

	The man's eyes snap open in terror as he looks directly into 
	CAMERA. His image falls away as the fiber-optic is jerked 
	back up through the hole in the floor.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...Looking at yearbooks and pictures 
		evokes so many memories...!

				  MARTIN (V.O.)
			(hushed)
		Fuck!

	MARTIN

	stuffs the apparati into an open duffel bag, and flies out 
	of frame.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...Some good. Some bad. But all 
		interesting...

	INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

	A BODYGUARD sits outside an apartment door. A muffled but 
	dire scream is heard from within and he is on his feet, gun 
	in hand. An exit door in the hallway slams open revealing 
	Martin, his gun already pointed at the Bodyguard. The 
	Bodyguard levels his at Martin.

				  MARTIN
		Freeze! Police!

	The Bodyguard hesitates just long enough to get double-tapped 
	through the head.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...As a graduate of the class of 
		1984, you are someone special...

	Martin moves to the dead Bodyguard, and locates a retractable 
	key chain on his belt. He unreels the ring of keys and opens 
	the door. He lets the keys retract back to the belt and drags 
	him into the apartment.

	INT. HUSKY MAN'S APARTMENT - SECONDS LATER

	Martin moves silently down the hall in a crouch. He comes to 
	the bedroom and slips across the threshold.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...Whenever news of you filters back, 
		the school is excited and proud of 
		your accomplishments...

	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Martin crouches down outside the bedroom door. He points the 
	gun at the door, and reaching up turns the knob. As the door 
	opens, the Husky Man FIRES wildly over Martin's head. Martin 
	returns with one shot to the hut which sits the man down on 
	the floor.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...We hope Grosse Pointe High prepared 
		you well to lead the kind of life 
		that makes an impact on the world...

	Martin kicks the gun away from the fallen man, and raises 
	his barrel to the man's forehead.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...Remember, "there's no where you 
		can go that you haven't learned how 
		to go in time... It's easy..."

				  HUSKY MAN
			(in severe pain)
		Whatever it is that I'm doing that 
		you don't like I'll stop doing it.

				  MARTIN
		It's not me.

	Martin cocks the gun....

	EXT. EAST-WEST HOLDING COMPANY, LOS ANGELES - DAY

	The perpetual sun shines down on a small lot of pre-fab office 
	bungalows.

	INT. BLANK HOLDING COMPANY

	A small suite of dry-walled offices.

	EAST-WEST HOLDING COMPANY

	is stenciled on glass doors behind Martin who stands in front 
	of a young woman reading from some kind of invitation. She 
	is MARCELLA MAYES.

				  MARCELLA
		...So come on back to the old oak 
		tree, acorns. Signed, the reunion 
		committee."

	Marcella holds up the mauve envelope and smiles slyly. For 
	the first time, Martin looks scared.

				  MARTIN
		Throw that away.

				  MARCELLA
		This?

				  MARTIN
		Don't tease me. You know what I do 
		for a living.

				  MARCELLA
		It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. 
		How was the trip?

				  MARTIN
		Tedious. I now authorize you to throw 
		away all personal mail.

				  MARCELLA
		All of it?

				  MARTIN
		And not show it to me. Ever again.

				  MARCELLA
		That's going to cost.

				  MARTIN
		I'll pay.

	Martin begins to walk past her into his office, but Marcella 
	stops him.

				  MARCELLA
		They're not happy, sir.

				  MARTIN
		I'm not happy.

				  MARCELLA
		They say their friend was suppose to 
		have a heart attack and die in his 
		sleep.

				  MARTIN
		He didn't.

				  MARCELLA
		They blame you for the compromise.

				  MARTIN
		And they want me to make up for it.

				  MARCELLA
		In Detroit. This weekend.

				  MARTIN
		Tell them that's impossible. I need 
		my normal lead time.

				  MARCELLA
		They were very upset.

				  MARTIN
		Would you describe their position as 
		inflexible?

				  MARCELLA
		Intractable, sir. You leave tonight.

	Marcella looks concerned.

				  MARCELLA
		And sir, I also get that broken-
		mirror, black-cat, Friday-the-
		thirteenth kind of feeling about 
		this one....

				  MARTIN
		There's nothing to be done about it.

				  MARCELLA
		I liquidated the last account in 
		Zurich, and split it into two new 
		ones in Estonia.

				  MARTIN
		Good. What else? Anything interesting?

				  MARCELLA
		Mmm, not really. But you're gonna 
		love this one.

	She hands him a piece of paper. He scans it.

				  MARCELLA
		Enough?

				  MARTIN
		Never enough.

				  MARCELLA
		But it's a Greenpeace boat. It'd be 
		so easy.

	Martin looks at her wearily. He puts it into the paper 
	shredder at the side of her desk.

				  MARTIN
		I have scruples. Next.

				  MARCELLA
		Paperwork on the Detroit thing. It's 
		a full dossier. Very comprehensive.

	She raises a thick brown dossier from the top of her desk 
	and puts it down again. Martin moves through a door to his 
	private office.

	MARTIN'S OFFICE

	Martin goes into his office and sits at his desk. On the 
	walls are a couple of boring prints of tallships. A bookshelf 
	holds trappings of a loose attempt at a cover-- a few shipping 
	manifests, sealane tables, and other specialized reference 
	books on import/export. He sits and stares.

	NEW ANGLE

	Time has passed, and Martin still sits at his desk massaging 
	his gums with a rubber-tipped dental pointer.

	C.U. MARTIN'S TEETH

	The dental tool jumps across the gaps between his teeth like 
	a hummingbird.

				  MARCELLA
			(off-screen)
		You should get going....

	MARTIN

	pulls back his jacket lapel and fits the utensil into a pocket 
	protector that is also home to a toothbrush, emery board, 
	tweezers, and comb. He stands and walks out of his office.

	FOYER

	Martin moves toward the door. As he passes Marcella she hands 
	him the mauve envelope and a travel portfolio.

				  MARCELLA
		Don't forget your identity.

				  MARTIN
		See you next week.

	Martin stops short as he reaches the threshold. He holds up 
	the envelope, and stares a dagger through it. On his way 
	out, over his shoulder...

				  MARTIN
		Tell Dr. Oatman I'm on my way.

	INT. DR. OATMAN'S OFFICE - DAY

	Martin slouches on a leather couch. He holds the mauve 
	envelope, now open.

				  DR. OATMAN (V.O.)
		Why don't you want to go to your 
		high school reunion?

				  MARTIN
		It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do 
		I have in common with those people? 
		Or with anyone?

	DR. OATMAN sits in the window. He is Kris Kringle-esque, and 
	wears a sheepskin vest, rough-hewn shirt, faded Levis, and 
	old Frye boots. Oatman nods with the suave understanding of 
	a man happy to collect fifty thousand in fees before asking 
	a tough question.

				  DR. OATMAN
		You went to school with these people.

				  MARTIN
		Come on.

				  DR. OATMAN
		We've spent a lot of time discussing 
		those years. Remember we said that 
		fear is a transfer of the bodily 
		hurt associated by experience with 
		the thing feared, to the thought of 
		the thing. Thus we fear a dog without 
		distinctly imagining its bite.

				  MARTIN
		Shouldn't you be taking notes?

				  DR. OATMAN
		Tell me about your vision of the 
		reunion.

	CLOSE-UP - MARTIN

								   CUT TO:

	MARTIN'S P.O.V. - FROM ABOVE

	Of a crowded gymnasium. The alumni below stops what they are 
	doing and look up at Martin, DRAWING GUNS OF ALL SHAPES AND 
	SIZES AND OPEN FIRE ON MARTIN. THE UNITED FORCE INSTANTLY 
	DISINTEGRATES, AND ALL 400 PEOPLE TURN THEIR GUNS ON EACH 
	OTHER. A BLOODBATH ENSUES. ONE ALUMNI SHOOTS HER OWN HEAD 
	OFF, ANOTHER MOWS DOWN THE BAR, ETC.

							   CUT BACK TO:

	MARTIN AND OATMAN

				  MARTIN
		It'll be depressing.

				  DR. OATMAN
		How do you know?

				  MARTIN
		I just know.

				  DR. OATMAN
		Say more.

				  MARTIN
		They'll have husbands and wives and 
		children and houses and dogs.... 
		made themselves a part of something. 
		And they can talk about what they 
		do. What am I going to say?
			(sarcastic)
		"I killed the President of Paraguay 
		with a fork."

	Oatman twitches nervously, almost spilling his coffee.

				  DR. OATMAN
		You needn't be so frank with me about 
		your work.

				  MARTIN
		Why not. I trust you. You couldn't 
		turn me in because of Doctor-Patient 
		privilege... and I don't want to be 
		"withholding"... and I know where 
		you live.

				  DR. OATMAN
		You know where I live?

				  MARTIN
		We're both professionals, Oatman.

				  DR. OATMAN
		I think what you fear Martin is 
		domesticity. It's the greatest fear 
		that men have who belong to Western 
		Culture. It's centuries old. Like 
		King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th 
		century who decided one day that he 
		was so bored with his dreary life at 
		home with his wife he thought, "Well, 
		wouldn't it be great if we hit the 
		road and fought... oh... the 
		Saracens."  So he put the word out 
		and was amazed when a million men 
		signed up and all of them wanted to 
		go and fight in distant lands and do 
		terrible things to people rather 
		than stay at home with their families.

				  MARTIN
		So you're saying that Ulysses--
		everything he said to his queen when 
		he came back--everything was a lie? 
		He just wanted to fuck around?

				  DR. OATMAN
		Yes.

				  MARTIN
		Mmm.

	Beat.

				  DR. OATMAN
		And how have you been feeling about 
		your... work lately?

				  MARTIN
		Uneasy. Dispassionate. Bored. It's 
		just getting hard to go to work in a 
		good mood. I'm starting to think 
		I've been in the business too long. 
		Last week I did a guy younger than 
		me.

	INT. CHURCH -

	SERIES OF QUICK SHOTS:

	MARTIN

	From the back of the darkened empty church, we see him mount 
	the altar.  A priest in fact.

	MARTIN'S HANDS

	open the gilded doors to reveal the chalice. He removes it, 
	squirts a clear liquid into the cup, and swishes it out. He 
	returns the chalice to the cabinet.

				  MARTIN (V.O.)
		The church seems to be purging itself 
		of it's pedophile.

	MARTIN

	Sits in the back pew of the church, now crowded for Mann. He 
	watches the PRIEST lift the chalice into the air, murmur a 
	prayer, and drink from it. The Priest collapses behind the 
	altar.

				  MARTIN (V.O.)
		It's a bull market.

	C.U. OF ALTAR CARPET

	The chalice bounces free from the Priest's hand as it hits 
	the ground.

				  MARTIN (V.O.)
		Anyway, that never use to happen. I 
		was always the prodigy. Now I'm just 
		one of the guys.

				  DR. OATMAN (V.O.)
		Maybe some of the discomfort you're 
		feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over 
		the innocent people you've killed.

	INT. OATMAN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

				  MARTIN
		If I show up at your door, chances 
		are you did something to bring me 
		there. I don't care about that stuff, 
		anyway.

				  DR. OATMAN
		What stuff?

				  MARTIN
			(dismissive)
		Morality.

	Oatman's glad the session's just about over.

				  DR. OATMAN
		Go to your reunion, Martin. See those 
		people and discover what they mean 
		to you. Try not to kill anybody for 
		a few days, see how you feel.

				  MARTIN
		If I get antsy I'll kill a few small 
		animals.

				  OATMAN
		Now we're making progress.

	INT. CONDO - NIGHT

	Very dark. No pictures or plants. Almost no furniture, and 
	what he does have is black. The only sign of life is a CAT. 
	The cat watches on as Martin sorts through a cardboard box, 
	finally coming to a photo album.

				  CAT
		Meow.

				  MARTIN
		Just a minute.

	INSERT-ALBUM

	A teen-aged Martin Blank: shy boy with a nervous smile. He 
	poses with his mother, an older woman with a kind smile... 
	but her eyes are dark; aged by a life of work and worry. On 
	the opposing page is a gilt funeral announcement that reads: 
	"IN LOVING MEMORY... VISTOR ALLEN BLANK...."

	MARTIN

	turns the page.

	INSERT-PHOTO ALBUM

	A photograph of a tall, thin girl: a bright smile from within 
	a bulky winter coat. A girl he's always wondered about: DEBI 
	NEWBERRY. Handwritten on the photo in girlish loops: "Would 
	you rather...?!"

				  CAT
		Meow!

	INT. KITCHEN - SAME

	Martin pulls himself away from the album and the cat follows 
	him, moaning hungrily--

				  MARTIN
		Food soon...

	Martin opens a restaurant-style refrigerator. It holds various 
	bottles of vitamins, spirulina, wheatgrass, digestible 
	hydrogen peroxide, fluoride treatment, oxygenated mouth rinse, 
	and thirty cans of CATFOOD.

				  MARTIN
		Tuna or liver?

				  CAT
		Meow.

				  MARTIN
		Tuna it is.

	He opens a can for the cat and a bottle for himself. While 
	the cat eats, he returns to the cardboard box. Finds a 
	YEARBOOK. Flips it open....

	INSERT-YEARBOOK

	A picture of a senior class "Blues Brothers" party: a group 
	of teens mug to the camera in Blues Brothers get-ups. 
	Sprinters race for a finish line, their chests stretching 
	for the tape.

	DEBI NEWBERY'S SENIOR PICTURE

	A more mature version of the girl in the album. Her name 
	appears under his picture...

	INT. GROCER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

	Track light fills the gourmet-rustic kitchen. GROCER stands, 
	wearing a burgundy Fila sweat suit, pushing beets into a 
	vegetable juicer. Next to the juicer are piles of celery and 
	carrots, as well. A low-key BLIP is heard from another room. 
	Grocer tops off the glass and takes it out of the kitchen.

	INT. GROCER'S GREAT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Grocer enters the main room of the villa-style A-frame. He 
	moves to an antique oak desk and sits in front of a COMPUTER.

	ON-SCREEN GRAPHICS

		  "Click OK for remote access caller"

	OK is clicked.

		   "Availability for two days in Detroit area"

				 "Terms"

				"$560,000"

				  "When"

				  "Now"

				"OK/ FAX materials"

	Grocer leans back in his chair and sips the juice. After a 
	moment, the FAX machine on the desk rattles. The computer 
	beeps.

	  "confirmation number of wire transfer#: AJ6687-OI99471"

	Grocer hits the return button after taking in the number. A 
	graphic appears:

		"Connection is terminated/ Status idle"

	Grocer's FAX begins to moan and chatter. Grocer raises his 
	juice glass to the computer in a lazy toast.

	INT. PLANE - NIGHT

	Martin reclines in first class, soaring toward the Midwest 
	on the red-eye. He has already scanned his magazines and 
	they are piled in the empty seat next to him. He sets aside 
	a Powerbar. Martin reads Kill Without Joy. After a moment, 
	he sets the book down and takes up Iron John.

	INT. DETROIT AIRPORT TERMINAL - EARLY MORNING

	At the edge of the airport bar sits LARDNER and MCCULLERS, 
	two Government Spooks, agency unknown. They are both in 
	blazers, no ties, early thirties, and they watch the passing 
	crowd.

				  LARDNER
		You always say that. You always say 
		that. I'm telling you, you never met 
		the man.

				  MCCULLERS
		Seventeen months ago I was posting a 
		walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He 
		never saw me. But I saw him, though.

				  LARDNER
		Lisbon?

				  MCCULLERS
		In Portugal, yes.

	In the background, Martin passes by them as he walks down 
	the hall. Without directly regarding him, the two stand, 
	drop some cash on the bar, and begin to leave.

				  LARDNER
		Here's the news: He hasn't been in 
		Portugal since '90. I know that from 
		the file. Why don't you read the 
		file, man?

				  MCCULLERS
		In fact, I think I talked with him, 
		in Bonn.

	Lardner can neither confirm nor deny this.

				  LARDNER
		You always say that. You always have 
		to know everybody. Why don't I just 
		take the weekend off and let you 
		kill him. Since you two are so close.

	They exit.

	EXT. EXIT RAMP, DETROIT AIRPORT - MORNING

	INSIDE MARTIN'S CAR

	Martin, in a black Lincoln Town Car, veers off of the airport 
	artery and on to a turnpike. The radio broadcasts the news.

				  BROADCAST (V.O.)
		...with highs today in the upper 
		seventies. Related stocks on Wall 
		Street today as scandal continues to 
		rock the joint U.S.-Japanese Tech 
		Center...

	MARTIN'S CAR

	blows past CAMERA and on down the road. After a beat, a mid-
	eighties Ford Country Squire station wagon follows, occupied 
	by two figures.

	INSIDE THE COUNTRY SQUIRE

	are Lardner and McCullers. They listen to the same broadcast.

				  BROADCAST (V.O.)
		...An unknown "whistle-blower" has 
		leaked a number of critical flaws in 
		the safety designs of next year's 
		models to authorities that could 
		cost millions in recalls....

	MARTIN

	flips through the dial, pausing on Rush Limbaugh who waxes 
	fascistically.

				  MARTIN
		Mein hero.

	...and then turns the dial again and cuts in on "Armageddon 
	Time," slow reggae vibe by The Clash.

	EXT. HIGHWAY-

	Martin drives down the roadway... headlong into his past. 
	Dig it...

	INT. MARTIN'S CAR

	Martin turns up the volume as he reacts to a familiar 
	voice....

				  FEMALE DEEJAY (V.O.)
			(on radio)
		--this is WFRN, all vinyl, all the 
		time. Oldies from the eighties. It's 
		a cold summer day in Grosse Pointe--

								   CUT TO:

	CLOSE-UP - A FULL, FEMALE MOUTH

	lit only by dime slivers of sunlight, in front of a 
	microphone. Stray, gossamer strands of hair hanging in her 
	face move in front of her mouth as she speaks....

				  FEMALE DEEJAY
		--and I'm ready for some good tunes 
		and angry talk. Or angry tunes and 
		good talk--

								   CUT TO:

	MARTIN

	looking somewhere far away, beyond what is before him in the 
	windshield...

				  FEMALE DEEJAY (V.O.)
		--Or maybe we'll just play the Cocteau 
		Twins and get over the goo-angry-
		talking music. As you know--

								   CUT TO:

	THE DEEJAY'S HANDS

	as they distractedly toy with the wire at the base of the 
	mic.

				  FEMALE DEEJAY (V.O.)
		--for some moments in life there are 
		no words, and a little nonsense now 
		and then is relished by the wisest 
		man--

								   CUT TO:

	MARTIN

	still rapt, makes a sharp turn into a shopping district.

								   CUT TO:

	HER MOUTH

				  FEMALE DEEJAY
		--The Cocteau Twins, though also a 
		band of the nineties, will be aired 
		due to the fact that they created 
		their own language to sing by--

								   CUT TO:

	MARTIN

	slows on a quaint street of cute shops. He creeps up to a 
	storefront on hid right and stops, staring through the 
	passenger window....

								   CUT TO:

	DEBI NEWBERRY

	the female deejay. She sits slumped in a well-worn executive 
	chair, her back to the studio console and the picture window 
	behind it that opens to the street....

				  DEBI
		--Now that's freedom--

	she swivels in the chair to face the street....

	DEBI'S P.O.V.

	of Martin's Town Car outside, Martin silhouetted in shadow.

	DEBI

	Her brow furrowed as she peers at the car, something summoned 
	by the dark figure. Her words falter almost imperceptibly.

				  DEBI
		--The best I can do is a rhyme: Where 
		are all the good men dead? In the 
		heart or in the head? Back later....

	MARTIN

	Shaken from his trance by her stare, pulls back into the 
	street and disappears....

	INT. MARTIN'S CAR - MORNING

	Martin drives, listening to the radio. He turns the corner 
	with an expectant look on his face. Suddenly his face drops 
	as he slows and pulls over....

	MARTIN'S P.O.V. - 7-11 STORE

	Martin looks left of the store, then right, behind him, then 
	back at the store. Bewildered, he gets out of the car.

	WIDE SHOT

	of Martin as he walks with purpose. He halts in the middle 
	of the lot. He puts his hands on his hips, stares, then moves 
	in... We stay wide as he enters the store and addresses the 
	clerk inside.

				  MARTIN
		What are you doing here?

	CARL, the store clerk tries to get a grip on this question.

				  CARL
		A double shift. What's it look like?
			(softening)
		Can I help you with something?

	Martin's head pans the room, processing.

				  MARTIN
		I don't think so.

	EXT. 7-11 PAYPHONE - MORNING

	Martin continues to gaze at the structure as if it's a lunar 
	landscape.

				  MARTIN
			(into phone)
		Dr. Oatman. Dr. Oatman. Please pick 
		up if you're there... It's Martin 
		Blank. It's gone. My house. It's not 
		here. My house is gone and now there's 
		a 7-11 here... And that's 
		unfortunate... You can never go home 
		again, Dr. Oatman.

	Martin hangs up. He watches one-stop shoppers come and go.

				  MARTIN
			(to himself)
		But I guess you can shop there.

	INT. NURSING HOME - DAY

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	of a NURSE leading him down a drab, antiseptic hallway. She 
	banks into the sunlit room where a wispy woman in her late 
	fifties sits expectantly on the edge of the bed clutching 
	her purse in one hand, a filterless Pall-Mall in the other, 
	a light coat on. This is MARY BLANK. She suffers from 
	Alzheimer's or something just as debilitating.

				  NURSE
		Mary, your son's here.

	The nurse gently eases Mary up. Martin hugs Mary stiffly and 
	pats her shoulders. Mary takes hold of Martin's arm. They 
	start out of the room.

	EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

	They walk past a school-yard park fitted with a set of swings, 
	baseball diamonds, and a small grove of trees. She smokes 
	and hacks.

				  MARY
		I bought a new rug.

				  MARTIN
		That's wonderful, Mom.

				  MARY
		What's a revival tent?

				  MARTIN
		It's a place where religious people--

				  MARY
			(knowingly)
		Marlin Perkins and Jim!

				  MARTIN
		Jim?

				  MARY
		His assistant. He acted like Marlin's 
		son, only he wasn't. At least they 
		never said he was... I bet they were 
		lovers, faggots. Yes, gay lovers. 
		Wild Kingdom my ass!

	Mary coughs horribly.

				  MARTIN
		It's good to see you. I'm sure you're 
		curious about what I've been doing.

				  MARY
		I spoke to your father the other 
		day.

				  MARTIN
		I imagine that'd be rather difficult.

				  MARY
		Nature made him then broke the mold.

	Martin decides to change the subject.

				  MARTIN
		They told me you're taking lithium, 
		mom.

				  MARY
		Yes, they give me headaches. I have 
		a headache.

				  MARTIN
		You have a headache?

				  MARY
		I have a headache. You have a 
		headache?

				  MARTIN
		No, I don't have one.

				  MARY
		You don't have a headache. I have a 
		headache.

	Mary leans in close, smiling.

				  MARY
		We had a good laugh, didn't we?

				  MARTIN
		Yeah. I guess we did.

	EXT. NURSING HOME - DAY

	As they head toward Martin's car, Mary stops and points to 
	it.

				  MARY
		Why don't you return this car and 
		borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to 
		the rent-a-car so you can get a ride 
		back.

				  MARTIN
		I think I'll go see Debi today.

				  MARY
		Of course you will.

				  MARTIN
		I can't think of anything to say to 
		her that seems appropriate given I 
		left and never said goodbye to her.

				  MARY
		Take care of her. She's a keeper.

				  MARTIN
		Yeah...

				  MARY
		And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro 
		on foreign exchange?

				  MARTIN
		I have always thought about her and 
		missed her.

	A nurse approaches with a wheelchair.

				  MARY
		Separate the wheat from the chaff 
		and you've got the candle cat.

	Together, Martin and the nurse help Mary into it. Mary gazes 
	at Martin, taking him in.

				  MARY
		Remember no matter how impossible 
		your problems feel. I've known people 
		without a chance in the world. And 
		all of a sudden, they have lives.  
		Time allows miracles. Let yourself 
		breathe, son.

	Martin bends down and kisses her on the cheek. The nurse 
	spins the chair around and heads toward the building. He is 
	somewhat fatigued from the experience, but he tries once 
	more to connect.

				  MARTIN
		Mom...

	The nurse stops and turns Mary around to face him. Mary looks 
	up at Martin and brightens. She starts to sing out like Ethel 
	Merman, arms out Broadway style.

				  MARY
		"What's up doc/ what's cookin'?/ 
		What's up doc?/ Are ya lookin'?/ 
		Hey! Look out!  You're gonna hurt 
		someone,/ with that old shotgun,/ 
		Hey... what's... up... Doooooc...!/ 
		We really mean it!"

	Mary stops short, and squints at Martin.

				  MARY
		Hey, you're a handsome devil. What's 
		your name?

	EXT. GRAVEYARD ROAD - DAY

	Martin stops the car and looks out the window at the sea of 
	headstones. He jerks his hand in a stiff wave...

				  MARTIN
		Hey Pop... You got off easy. The 
		house is a 7-11. Mom's a psycho-
		pharmacological punching bag and I 
		murder for cash. If you were here I 
		think you'd be proud.

	He drives off.

	INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - DAY

	The room features a big square bed, dresser and television. 
	Martin enters, kicks a leather bag under the bed, and grabs 
	the steel-sided briefcase.

				  MARTIN
		pries out a wall vent, slides in the 
		case and replaces the vent.

	EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

	Lardner and McCullers are staked out along the main strip of 
	town. Lardner snores, face pressed up against the passenger 
	window. McCullers lays back in his seat, a to-go cup in his 
	lap. He taps the cup with one finger as he absently sings 
	his favorite Bob Seeger song to himself...

				  MCCULLERS
		"...Against the wind... just a young 
		man running... Against the wind... 
		let the cowboy's ride!... Blame on 
		it the thuuunder! Night moves..."

	McCullers catches of Martin's Town Car coming down the street. 
	He nudges Lardner, and points.

	LARDNER AND MCCULLERS P.O.V.

	of Martin pulling into a space on the street outside the 
	radio station. He gets out, looking nervous.

	INT. RADIO STATION - DAY

	Debi flips on the "ON-AIR" switch and prepares to speak into 
	the microphone. Martin walks in. Debi sees him. They stare 
	at each other. The song ends. Dead air. After a moment...

				  DEBI
			(on air, groping)
		WRFN playing all vinyl, all the time. 
		Oldies from the eighties. That was 
		ah... the Specials. Doing... one of 
		their songs...

	Debi turns to turntable B and finds it empty. She turns back 
	to turntable A and lets the record roll on.

				  DEBI
		...and here's another.

	Debi swivels around to face Martin.

				  MARTIN
		"Oldies from the eighties?"

	After a long pause....

				  DEBI
		I just play my own collection.

				  MARTIN
		It's nice to see you again.

	Debi says nothing, just stares at him, in shock.

				  MARTIN
		How long has it been?

				  DEBI
		Since you stood me up on prom night 
		and vanished without saying a word?

				  MARTIN
		Ten years, I think. What I miss?

	Debi slowly grooves into irony, her best defense.

				  DEBI
		Well, let me see... they tore down 
		the George Orwell monument and put 
		up a bust of George Michael. Main 
		Street's a four-laner, no left turns 
		four to seven. I was married and 
		divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now 
		officially the new sister city to 
		Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have 
		fiber-optic town meetings every two 
		months.

				  MARTIN
		Here is now there. There is here.

	Their eyes lock on each other...

				  DEBI
		Those are the headlines.

	The request line buzzes.

				  DEBI
		Hold that thought.
			(into phone)
		WRFN FM, Grosse Pointe. All vinyl, 
		all the...
			(pauses)
		No Pearl Jam. Call back in ten years.

	Beat. Debi makes the move.

				  DEBI
		Tell me about yourself.

				  MARTIN
		I'm in California most of the time. 
		Traveling a lot on business. That's 
		about it, really.

				  DEBI
		That's it?

				  MARTIN
		Not much else.

				  DEBI
		What's your business?

				  MARTIN
		I'm a professional killer.

				  DEBI
		Professional killer. Do you get dental 
		with that?

	Beat.

				  MARTIN
		Well, I'm in town for a few days, 
		anyway.

	They run out of words, the moment too big for small talk. 
	Martin gets the fear, breaks it off.

				  MARTIN
		Well, I gotta go. But I'll come back.

				  DEBI
		Okay.

	Martin leaves Debi sitting alone, in disbelief.

	EXT. RADIO STATION - DAY

	Martin steps out of the storefront station along the 
	fashionable Grosse Pointe shopping district. He stops in the 
	middle of the street with a strained look on his face.

	INT. LARDNER & MCCULLERS' COUNTRY SQUIRE - SAME

	LARDNER & MCCULLERS' P.O.V.

	of Martin standing in the street.

	LARDNER AND MCCULLERS

	They frown, wondering at Martin's next move.

	INT. DEEJAY BOOTH -

	Debi lost in thought, still. After a moment, she sits upright 
	and flips the "ON-AIR" switch.

				  DEBI
			(into mike)
		A man comes to you. He is from the 
		past bringing you pain long since 
		put behind you. He says peculiar 
		things and leaves abruptly. It all 
		comes flooding back...

	EXT. STREET -

	Martin stops in his tracks. His face softens, then becomes 
	determined. He turns and walks back toward the station.

	INT. DEEJAY BOOTH -

	Debi broadcasting...

				  DEBI
		It felt like an apparition, or some 
		cheap, gruesome Rod Serling time 
		warp I'd been thrust back into without 
		warning. There's a strangeness in 
		the air and I don't mind telling 
		you, I'm a little spooked. He was a 
		man from my past. A man I loved. A 
		man who disappeared.

	DEBI'S P.O.V.

	of Martin walking back into the station.

				  DEBI
		A man who's walking back into the 
		station.

	Martin comes into the booth. The temperature rises as they 
	square off.

	INT. COUNTRY SQUIRE -

				  LARDNER
		Well?

				  MCCULLERS
		I don't think so.

				  LARDNER
		Well, remember when Frysal's men 
		paid off the Deejay in Cairo to 
		announce a bogus press conference in 
		the --

				  MCCULLERS
		--Nooo--

				  LARDNER
		--Yes. And the Munich Olympics in 
		'72. A local radio station started 
		broadcasting news of the massacre 
		two minutes before it happened.

	McCullers is not to be outdone.

				  MCCULLERS
		That's strictly Bàader-Meinhof stuff.

				  LARDNER
		It was the PLO.

				  MCCULLERS
		Whatever.

	INT. DEEJAY BOOTH

	Martin and Debi locked in a passionate embrace. They break 
	away.

				  DEBI
		Sit.

	Martin obeys. Debi clandestinely flips the "ON-AIR" switch 
	as she drops into her chair. The "ON-AIR" light bar goes on 
	above and behind Martin. Unbeknownst to him their conversation 
	is put out over the airwaves.

				  DEBI
		All right mystery man. I want some 
		answers. Let's recap. Spring of '84. 
		Two young lovers with frightening 
		natural chemistry. The girl sits in 
		a seven-hundred dollar prom dress at 
		her father's house waiting for the 
		most romantic night of her young 
		life. The boy never shows up, until 
		now. So, what's the question?

				  MARTIN
		Where have I been?

				  DEBI
		More like what happened? What 
		happened, Mr. Blank?

				  MARTIN
		I don't know exactly. I could venture 
		a guess but it would sound like a 
		rationalization... I thought you 
		know... maybe seeing you, some 
		friends, my house... of course now a 
		7-11--

				  DEBI
		--Torn down in the name of convenience--

				  MARTIN
		--and I guess, sure, seeing you would 
		be part of that whole equation... I 
		suppose the most important thing, 
		really. I don't know. Anyway, this 
		whole thing's my therapist's idea. 
		It's my shrink, really.

				  DEBI
		Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?

				  MARTIN
		You see someone?

				  DEBI
		Uh, no. So you're back now, a decade 
		later, and you want to sort things 
		out with me. The question now is, do 
		I allow you... access... to my being?

	Martin says nothing.

				  DEBI
		All right then. Would you like to 
		share any more deeply personal 
		thoughts with our listening audience 
		before we go to our phone poll and 
		see how the folks in radioland come 
		down on this one?

	A beat as Martin realizes he's been had. He seems about to 
	bolt.

				  DEBI
		Should a broken-hearted girl give a 
		guy a second chance at love....

	Debi jabs a phone line on the console.

				  DEBI
			(HARD)
		You're on the air.

	Martin deflates.

				  OLD WOMAN'S VOICE
		I think this young man has avoided 
		the question completely. Has not 
		discussed "what happened" nor if 
		he's sorry for what he has done. 
		Therefore, I don't see any reason 
		why you should see him until he fully 
		discloses his intentions and feelings.

				  DEBI
		Thank you caller.

	Stabs another line.

				  DEBI
		You're on the air.

				  DUMB GUY VOICE
		Are you there?

				  DEBI
		Yes.

				  DUMB GUY VOICE
		No, the guy.

	Martin looks up, humiliated.

				  MARTIN
		Yeah....

				  DUMB GUY VOICE
		Uh... when you guys use to go out... 
		Did you guys ever... heh heh heh 
		heh... ever fuckin', ever totally 
		fuckin' heh heh heh-

				  DEBI
		Next caller.

				  GUFF MAN VOICE
		I don't know, Debi. Sounds like bad 
		gas to me. I would not allow him 
		access to your being.

				  DEBI
		Thank you.

				  DEBI
		Grosse Pointe Michigan, I hear you 
		loud and clear: "If you love something 
		set it free. If it comes back to you 
		it's, well...

	She turns to him and shrugs apologetically.

				  DEBI
		...Broken...."

	Martin has his answer.

	EXT. RADIO STATION - DAY

	Martin leaves the station, alone and beaten down.

				  MARTIN
		Dammit. Never trust my instincts.

	He scans the main strip.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	A MAN walks down the street. He is FELIX, a bookish, 
	forgettable man in his forties, wearing Le Coq Sportif sweats 
	and shoes. He looks as if he has a dark cloud over his head. 
	Martin's seen him somewhere, and doesn't like what he 
	remembers. Martin's POV TRACKS him.

	FELIX'S P.O.V.

	As he walks down the street, he spots the Country Squire, 
	and eyes Lardner and McCullers in the front seat.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	follows Felix's eyes to Lardner and McCullers and catches 
	their look. Their eyes lock, neither wanting to betray that 
	they've made each other. They all do a pretty good job. His 
	P.O.V. swings to a square-jawed, hale fellow wearing dark 
	sunglasses who is approaching directly and only a few feet 
	away. The man is going for something in his breast pocket...

	Reaches into his own jacket, most likely for a gun....

	THE MAN

	pulls out a glasses case, and takes off his shades-- He is 
	PAUL SWIDERSKI.

	MARTIN AND PAUL

	Martin relaxes.

				  PAUL
			(grinning ear-to-ear)
		Hell, I would've voted for you, but 
		there's all this apple sauce stuck 
		in my phone... I don't wanna talk 
		about it. How the hell are you?!
			(extends his hand)
		Here's five good ones!

	No trace of recognition on Martin's face.

				  PAUL
		Marty! It's me. Paul.

				  MARTIN
			(realizing)
		Paul?

				  PAUL
			(re: hand)
		You're leaving me hanging here...

	They shake. Martin looks him up and down, astonished at the 
	respectable veneer of his old burn-out friend.

				  PAUL
		Hey. Give me a break.

	INT. PAUL'S BMW - DAY

	Martin and Paul rive through Grosse Pointe, Michigan: Wide 
	streets lined with huge, shady oaks. Castle-like homes on 
	golf-course green lawns. A comfortable, Midwestern Beverly 
	Hills. They are cruising their old haunts, Paul smoking a 
	joint.

				  PAUL
		This won't take but a minute. I just 
		gotta hold their hands for a final 
		walk-through. I'll take them in, get 
		'em out, then you and I can grab a 
		little quality time.

	Martin looks out the window, breathing in the past.

				  PAUL
		Goddamn, It's good to see you. I was 
		afraid you joined a cult or something. 
		I half-expected you to come back to 
		town in a fennel wreath and paper 
		pants.

	Paul offers Martin the joint. He declines.

				  MARTIN
		There was no money in it.

	Martin regards Paul archly.

				  MARTIN
			(grinning)
		So what happened to you?

				  PAUL
		Same thing that happened to you-- I 
		stopped poutin' there on the 
		sidelines. Got in. Got on the team.  
		I joined the working week, you slick 
		fucking asshole, so why don't you 
		valet park your high horse and take 
		it easy on your old buddy, Paul.

				  MARTIN
		Fair enough.

	Beat.

				  PAUL
		God it's great to see you.

				  MARTIN
		You too.

	EXT. FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT HOUSE - DAY

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	of a lovely YOUNG COUPLE on the front porch of a mid-sized 
	Wright home... Perhaps that could be him if things were 
	different, but for now it feels like along shot. Paul is 
	hawking the house to them out of earshot.

				  SOUTHTEC GUARD (V.O.)
		Well, we do what we have to do if we 
		find you on the property. But we 
		don't really enforce the law, we 
		execute company policy for homeowners.

	MARTIN AND THE GUARD

	standing in the driveway.

				  MARTIN
		So when are you authorized to use 
		deadly force?

				  SOUTHTEC GUARD
		Well, a 'course, taxes provide your 
		basic service-- police and whatnot. 
		But our customers need a little more 
		than just that, you understand? This 
		badge doesn't mean that I am a peace 
		officer.

	The woman turns at Martin and smiles. Martin smiles back.

				  MARTIN
		So it's not a meaningful symbol, or 
		anything. That badge is just the 
		badge of your company. If I look 
		suspicious on your customers' property--
		well, under those heightened 
		circumstances you have the authority 
		to, ah... To shoot me.

				  SOUTHTEC GUARD
		To shoot you. Correct.

				  MARTIN
		How did you get this job?

				  SOUTHTEC GUARD
		Well, they were hiring, and it was 
		only a two week course...

				  MARTIN
			(pleasantly)
		Wow.

	Paul walks the happy couple down the steps.

				  PAUL
			(to couple)
		...What more can I say.

				  HUSBAND
			(smiling)
		We'll talk soon.

				  PAUL
			(much hand gesturing)
		You'll be raising your new family in 
		a work of art. A work of art in a 
		work of art.

	Paul looks at Martin and the Guard, inviting them into the 
	sell.

				  SOUTHTEC GUARD
		I'm sure you'll be very happy.

	All look to Martin....

				  MARTIN
			(heartfelt)
		When my time comes, if it ever does, 
		I want a beautiful, normal place 
		like this... and a wife like you...

	All are confused. Martin thumbs to the guard.

				  MARTIN
		...and you'll be safe here...

	Paul looks at his shoes and rolls his shoulders.

	EXT. FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT HOUSE

	Lardner and McCullers sit in the wagon, watching the house 
	in the distance.

	INT. PAUL'S BMW - LATER

	Martin and Paul cut through a particularly charming 
	neighborhood.

				  PAUL
		Now. I don't make a habit of pimping 
		my friends, but there is one prime 
		little piece of land that you must 
		see...

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	A sprawling gingerbread mansion rises into view. A long and 
	winding driveway cuts through thickly wooded property to the 
	house.

				  MARTIN (V.O.)
		Debi's house.

				  PAUL (V.O.)
		Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?

	C.U. OF MARTIN

				  MARTIN
		No. You drove us here.

				  PAUL
		Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, 
		isn't it?

				  MARTIN
		No.

	Martin's not listening. His eyes track the house out the 
	window.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	of the mansion.

	They roll slowly by Debi's house.

	They drive in silence for a beat. Paul suddenly swerves to 
	the shoulder, jams the brake, and turns on Martin.

				  PAUL
		Ten years. What happened!?

				  MARTIN
		I freaked out, joined the Army, worked 
		for the government, and went into 
		business for myself... I'm a 
		professional killer.

				  PAUL
		Thank you.

	Paul, satisfied, gets back on the road.

				  PAUL
		Professional killer, huh? Does that 
		come with a good HMO?

	EXT. ROAD - DAY

	Paul makes a turn. They approach a large car dealership. The 
	sign above it says

		  "DESTEPHANO'S BAVARIAN MOTOR WORKS"

				  MARTIN
			(looking ahead)
		He sells BMW's?

				  PAUL
		He sold me this bad boy.

				  MARTIN
		How could you put your hard-earned 
		dollars into the hands of the class 
		bully?

				  PAUL
		He gave me a great deal.

				  MARTIN
		Mein Dealer.

	Paul slows outside the lot. BOB DESTEPHANO-- a big, angry-
	looking man in an expensive suit-- stands in the lot, puffing 
	up amidst his stable of expensive cars.

				  PAUL
		Hey! Bob! The car's running great.

				  BOB
			(dismissive)
		Glad to hear it.

	Bob turns his back on them and begins to walk away.

				  MARTIN
			(shouts)
		Bob...

				  BOB
			(turning)
		What?

				  MARTIN
		It's me. Martin Blank.

				  BOB
		Really...? So what?

				  MARTIN
		Okay. See you later.

	EXT. RADIO STATION - NIGHT

	Martin climbs out of Paul's car and begins to walk toward 
	his own. Paul calls after him.

				  PAUL
		See you at the left-a-boy-came-back-
		a-man-made-good party.

	Martin nods him off. Paul pulls away.

	MARTIN

	stands across the street from the radio station, looking at 
	Debi in the window... Martin draws a thin rifle scope from 
	his back pocket, and lifts it to his eye...

	MARTIN'S P.O.V. - SCOPE

	of Debi, in the crosshairs, bored, tapping a pencil to the 
	beat of an unheard song.

	MARTIN

	dejected. He puts the scope away and gets in his car.

	INT. 7-11 - NIGHT

	Martin walks into the store, looking around once again at 
	his old home. To the left of the door, a typical suburban 
	teenage SKATEBOARDER is lost in the "Mortal Combat" video 
	game and something too loud from his walkman. Carl, still 
	working the double, nods to Martin.

				  CARL
		Can I help you?

				  MARTIN
		What's done is done.

	Martin moves up one aisle to the gum rack. He picks out a 
	pack of Beaman's and unwraps a stick as he heads to the 
	counter. On the way, he makes a black Town Car pulling into 
	a spot next to his own. He immediately changes course, and 
	bee-lines for a rear aisle where he ducks down...

	FELIX

	Comes through the door, drawing a Mac-10 for each hand.

	MARTIN

	grabs the gum out of his mouth and sticks it onto the bottom 
	of the Glock .9mm he has produced from somewhere in his suit.

	CARL

	grabs the cash drawer, sets it on the counter, and puts his 
	hands up.

	THE SKATEBOARDER

	Plays on.

	FELIX AND CARL

	Felix shoots CARL DEAD on his way toward

	MARTIN

	Bolts up the cooler aisle. Bursts of FIRE follow him, taking 
	out each freezer door behind him.

	MARTIN AND FELIX

	EXCHANGE FIRE John Woo-style between the aisles of the cramped 
	store. Felix delivers a close-to-home burst as he jumps the 
	counter, sending Martin diving out of view.

	MARTIN

	pinned behind the Slurpee machine, pauses to reload his now 
	two Glock nines. Martin steals a glance to get a bead on 
	Felix and is met with a salvo that rocks the Slurpee machine, 
	spattering him with several flavors... and that's all he can 
	take. Martin comes up BLASTING with both guns, but all that's 
	left of Felix is swinging doors and squealing tires.

	Martin moves to the cashier island, low to the ground.

	THE SKATEBOARDER

	Twitches and jerks, still absorbed in his game and oblivious 
	to the surrounding carnage.

	CASHIER ISLAND

	Martin crawls through the waist-level swinging door and moves 
	to Carl.

	CARL

	is really dead. Martin rolls him over to check it out and 
	finds

	A BOMB

	under the corpse.

	MARTIN

	Flips the corpse back on top of the device and leaps the 
	counter toward the doors. He grabs the shoulder or the 
	Skateboarder, who shrugs him off, annoyed--

				  SKATEBOARDER
		What the fuck, man?!

	The video game screen explodes. Shot full of Martin's bullets. 
	The Skateboarder reacts backward and Martin jerks him out of 
	the double doors.

	EXT. 7-11 - CONTINUOUS

	The Skateboarder is running like crazy, and Martin's car is 
	peeling out in reverse as the 7-11 is blown to hell.

	INT. MARTIN'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

	Martin's hair is matted with Slurpee as he tries to drive 
	and cool out. He sees his do in the mirror, pulls out a comb 
	and starts to comb it back into a slick Pat Riley style.

	EXT. RADIO STATION - NIGHT

	Martin walks in, not looking half bad, considering. Debi 
	looks up from some reading. "Naïve Melody" by the Talking 
	Heads plays in the studio.

				  MARTIN
		Are you going to the reunion?

				  DEBI
		No. I'm not going. Is that why you're 
		here?

				  MARTIN
		That's part of it.

				  DEBI
		Well, you'll have a ball. You seem 
		to have everything everybody wants 
		when they go back. The car, the suit, 
		the watch. The look. That just leaves 
		the little things, like happiness, 
		character, point of view...

				  MARTIN
		It's always the little things.

				  DEBI
		Yep.

	Beat.

				  MARTIN
		I'm wondering how you've been. How 
		you are. I'd like to catch up with 
		you. If it's possible.

	Beat as Debi considers. She spins her seat to face him.

				  DEBI
		Okay. Let's catch up. You go first.

				  MARTIN
		Well, there's not much to tell.

				  DEBI
		I'm sure you've done worthwhile things 
		in the last ten years. You've had 
		experiences.

				  MARTIN
		Bad experiences.

				  DEBI
		You met people.

				  MARTIN
		Bad people.

				  DEBI
		Watched television?

				  MARTIN
		Bad television.

				  DEBI
			(amused)
		Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It 
		sounds like you need a Shockabuku.

				  MARTIN
		What's that?

				  DEBI
		It's a swift spiritual kick to the 
		head that alters your reality forever.

				  MARTIN
		That'd be good.

	Beat.

				  DEBI
		What do you want?

	The question is open.

				  MARTIN
		I figured I could pick you up tomorrow 
		around seven o'clock.

				  DEBI
		Let me get this straight, are you 
		asking me out?

				  MARTIN
		Yes.

				  DEBI
		Unbelievable.

				  MARTIN
		Seven it is.

				  DEBI
		I'll think about it.

	EXT. JOSHUA TREE CAMPSITE - NIGHT

	Under a crisp and starry night, a man and a woman sit around 
	a campfire. As we MOVE CLOSER we see that the woman is 
	Marcella reading, "Women Who Run With Wolves."  She tends to 
	s'mores on the campfire, assembles one, and hands it to MONTY, 
	her young outdoorsman boyfriend. Monty is perched on a small 
	boulder, engaged in a Tai-Chi-like ritual, wearing Patagonia's 
	finest. There is a path of crystals leading from the fire to 
	the boulder. In the background is a tent and a Nissan 
	Pathfinder. Monty's watch goes off.

				  MONTY
		Baby, it's eight o'clock.

	Marcella gets up.

				  MARCELLA
		Thanks, Monty.

	She tousles Monty's hair on the way to the truck.

	INT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

	Marcella gets in. She shuts the door and dials the phone.

				  MARCELLA
		Hey there, how'd it go?

	INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - NIGHT - INTERCUT

	Martin sits on the edge of the bed in a towel.

				  MARTIN
		It isn't done.

	Marcella pauses, taking this in.

				  MARCELLA
		This is not good.

				  MARTIN
		I'll do it tomorrow.

	Marcella considers this.

				  MARCELLA
		What's it look like?

				  MARTIN
		It's fine.

				  MARCELLA
		You haven't looked at the dossier.

				  MARTIN
			(a little defensive)
		I've looked at it.

	Martin eyes the vent.

				  MARCELLA
		You have.

				  MARTIN
		Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing 
		remarkable about it at all.

				  MARCELLA
		I have to call the client and give 
		them a reason why you're late.

				  MARTIN
		Tell them my house exploded.

	Beat. Marcella doesn't know what to make of this.

				  MARCELLA
		I'll call them and tell them you're 
		taking your time. Being a 
		professional.

				  MARTIN
		Okay, call them. Fine. Oh-- And if 
		you could find out why they double-
		booked the job, and who is trying to 
		kill me, and call me back-- that's 
		be great.

				  MARCELLA
		Will do.

	Martin hangs up. He moves up to the air vent, deciding to 
	get down to business. He pries it open, and withdraws his 
	briefcase, putting it down on the bed and propping it open. 
	He looks at the unopened dossier for a moment, flips it over 
	in his hands, and tosses it on the bed.

	BRIEFCASE

	We catch a glimpse of Martin's weapons. Martin picks up the 
	envelope and is about to tear the seal when

	THE PHONE RINGS

	Martin drops the envelope and lifts the receiver.

				  DEBI
			(filtered)
		Are you there?

				  MARTIN
		Yes.

				  DEBI
		Pick me up at my father's house at 
		around seven. And don't be late this 
		time.

	Beat.

				  DEBI
		Hello...?

				  MARTIN
		This night, this reunion will be an 
		important step in our relationship.

				  DEBI
		You're fucking psycho.

				  MARTIN
		Don't rush to judgement until all 
		the facts are in.

	She hangs up. Martin smiles and replaces the receiver. He 
	turns to the apparatus laid out on the bed.

	GUNS, BULLETS, ETC.

	What has been his life is beginning to look more like death 
	to him. He places the envelope in the case, then returns the 
	case to its hiding place.

	EXT. DINER - DAY

	Lardner and McCullers stake out Martin from the Country Squire 
	across the street.

				  MCCULLERS
		I wish he'd do his job already so we 
		could do our job.

				  LARDNER
		We can't do our job unless he does 
		his job.

				  MCCULLERS
		Why don't we just do his job then, 
		so we can do our job, and get the 
		fuck out of here.

				  LARDNER
		Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded 
		killer.

				  MCCULLERS
		Wait a minute--

				  LARDNER
		-Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, 
		but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until 
		a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and 
		then you come in and kill the Bad 
		Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.

				  MCCULLERS
		So if we do his job, we're the bad 
		guys. If we do our job, we're the 
		good guys.

				  LARDNER
		Yup.

	They both laugh, as if at some great joke. Their laughter is 
	caught short by the sight of

	LARDNER AND MCCULLERS' POV

				  GROCER
		moving into the diner.

	INT. DINER - LATE MORNING

	Martin sits in a window booth splitting nutrient caplets 
	into an apple juice and looking out the window.

	GROCER

	slides into the booth, across from Martin.

	MARTIN AND GROCER

	Martin draws a nasty little PPK pistol from his waist, and 
	levels it at Grocer under the table-- but Grocer is already 
	drawing his pistol down there, and there is an instant Mexican 
	breakfast stand-off.

				  GROCER
		Easy, tiger.

	A waitress approaches.

				  WAITRESS
		Hi. Welcome to B.I. McCafferty's. My 
		name is Melanie and I'll be your 
		server this morning. Let me tell you 
		about some of our specials. Today we 
		have the "Alfalfa on My Mind," our 
		feature omelette. And there's our 
		"Gatsby's West Egg Omelette." And if 
		you're in the mood for something 
		different there's the "I left my 
		heart in San Franchezie."

	Martin and Grocer's eyes remain locked.

				  GROCER
		I want two eggs poached, hash brown 
		well-done. English muffin for the 
		bread. And a coffee.

				  MARTIN
		Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg-
		white omelette.

				  WAITRESS
		What would you like in the omelette?

				  MARTIN
		Nothing in the omelette. Nothing at 
		all.

	The waitress nods pertly and leaves.

				  GROCER
			(re: the omelette)
		Come on, live a little. I'm sorry 
		about the incident yesterday.

				  MARTIN
		No harm no foul.

				  GROCER
		A little misunderstanding among my 
		associates.

	Beat.

				  GROCER
		I told them to kill you and they 
		didn't.

				  MARTIN
		Hard to get good help these days.

				  GROCER
		But since we're both here, I think 
		it's time to take a fresh look at 
		our relationship.

				  MARTIN
		I didn't get into this business to 
		have "associates." And I don't want 
		to join your Goddamned union. "Loner--
		" "Loner gunman." Get it? "On my 
		own." That's the whole point. Why 
		don't you become a cop, or something. 
		You can drink coffee in the morning... 
		with friends!

	Grocer looks a little hurt.

				  MARTIN
			(easing up)
		Look, this is a one-on-one business... 
		Every time you get to know people, 
		bad things happen. If it'll make you 
		feel any better, this is my last 
		job. So what do you say we put our 
		guns away and forget the whole damn 
		thing.

	Grocer loses it.

				  GROCER
		Fuck you! No scabs! From now on, 
		everything's regulated!

	Long beat as Grocer gets a hold of himself.

				  MARTIN
		No deal.

				  GROCER
		Fine. But we're not going to let you 
		do your job. Because we're gonna do 
		it. And then, after we do your job, 
		we're gonna do another little job...

				  MARTIN
			(Wry)
		Is that right?

				  GROCER
		Yeah-- after I shoot you through the 
		fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you 
		in the bullethole.

				  MARTIN
		Nice talk, Sugarmouth.

	INT. SUITE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

	Martin sits at a desk, staring at the reunion card. He tosses 
	it aside, gets up, and moves in front of a mirror. He wears 
	a crisp black suit and practices his greeting smile...

				  MARTIN
			(trying on smile)
		Yes, I'm a pet psychiatrist. I sell 
		couch insurance. I test-market 
		positive thinking. I lead a weekend 
		men's group, actually. We specialize 
		in ritual killings. I'm hungry, are 
		you hungry, I'm hungry, oooh, ooh.
			(sarcastic)
		Hi, I'm Martin Blank, remember me?  
		I'm not married, I have no kids and 
		I'd blow your brains out if someone 
		paid me enough... So how've you been? 
		Where do you stand on The Issues? 
		Are you Left? Right? Up, down, proud, 
		shamed, blahblahblahblah--

	EXT. DEBI'S HOUSE - EARLY EVENING

	Martin makes his way up the walk leading to the front door, 
	holding a simple bouquet of flowers. He skips up the front 
	steps and finds the doorbell. After a moment, Debi answers.

				  DEBI
		Flowers. That's funny.

				  MARTIN
		As long as I get the laugh.

				  DEBI
			(taking them)
		Here. Let me put these in some rubbing 
		alcohol.

	She backs into the house, and he follows.

	INT. NEWBERRY FOYER - CONTINUOUS

	Martin follows Debi into the hall. Both are enjoying this 
	atavistic ritual.

				  MARTIN
		You look beautiful.

				  DEBI
		Okay... Hold on...

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	through a doorway leading into a den. All that's visible of 
	MR. NEWBERRY, Debi's father, is a pair of legs resting in a 
	Barcolounger.

				  DEBI (V.O.)
		...Let me get my coat.

				  MARTIN
		I'll just help myself to a cocktail.

	DEBI

	moves up the stairs and disappears.

	MARTIN

	looks at the legs, rolls his shoulders, and heads into the 
	den.

	INT. DEN - CONTINUOUS

	Mr. Newberry sits in the recliner reading a Tom Clancy novel. 
	He is a corporate Aspen-dude-ranch sort with a good head of 
	hair. He sighs, closes the book on his knee and looks up to 
	Martin.

				  MARTIN
		Good evening, Mr. Newberry.

				  MR. NEWBERRY
		Good evening, Mr. Blank.

				  MARTIN
		How are you? How's business?

				  MR. NEWBERRY
		Martin, I don't know where you've 
		been since you abandoned my daughter 
		ten years ago, and I don't care. It 
		was good that you left, and I'm glad 
		you did. So what do you want to talk 
		about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe 
		I had you figured wrong.

				  MARTIN
		How's that?

				  MR. NEWBERRY
		I visualized you, in a haze, as one 
		of the slackster, flannel-wearing, 
		coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been 
		seeing in Newsweek.

				  MARTIN
		I took the other road. I'm more of a 
		self-reflective young lion who does 
		business with lead-pipe cruelty and 
		goes home to drink light beer in 
		milky-eyes isolation. I love sports 
		and sex and have no real relationships 
		with anyone. And you?

				  MR. NEWBERRY
		Oh, you know me, Martin. I'm the 
		same old sell-out baby-boomer, 
		exploiting the oppressed I got shot 
		for at Kent State. But why don't we 
		have a drink and forget the whole 
		thing?

	Newberry lays down his book, and moves behind the wet bar.

				  MARTIN
		Why not?

				  MR. NEWBERRY
		So what are you doing with your life 
		now, son?

				  MARTIN
		I'm a professional killer.

				  MR. NEWBERRY
		That's good.

	Debi's footsteps are heard coming down the stairs.

				  DEBI (O.S.)
		Okay

	Mr. Newberry watches Martin turn and walk out of the room.

	EXT. DEBI'S HOUSE

	Martin and Debi pull away from the curb.

	INT. CAR - DUSK

	Martin and Debi drive through that to Debi is town, and to 
	Martin is a widening pool of quicksand.

				  MARTIN
		Do you want to get a drink first?

				  DEBI
		I think they'll probably have booze 
		there.

				  MARTIN
		Right.

	Martin's right hand shakes off of the wheel a bit. He grips 
	it tighter. Suddenly, Martin turns the wheel and pulls into 
	a gas station parking lot, halting next to a pay phone.

				  MARTIN
		I'll just be a second.

	Debi nods, a little confused but going with it.

				  DEBI
		Okay...

	EXT. PAYPHONE - MINUTES LATER

	Martin stands at the kiosk next to the Town Car, mid-
	conversation.

				  MARTIN
			(defensive)
		...Well, I didn't kill anyone, but 
		someone tried to kill me and the guy 
		in the middle got killed. So if I 
		see that guy again I'm definitely 
		going to kill him, but I won't kill 
		anyone else. Oh, except for the guy 
		I was sent here to kill. I don't 
		know...

	INT. OATMAN'S OFFICE - INTERCUT

	Oatman treats his patient.

				  DR. OATMAN
		What else? Say more.

				  MARTIN
		Saw my mom... I'm with Debi, and I'm 
		on my way to the reunion.

	In the background, Lardner and McCullers drive past the 
	station.

				  DR. OATMAN
		Okay. Repeat this after me.

				  MARTIN
		Out Loud?

	Martin looks to Debi. She looks up and smiles. We hear Dr. 
	Oatman's command, Martin mumbles them back.

				  MARTIN
		...I am at home with the me. I am 
		rooted in me, who is on this 
		adventure.

				  DR. OATMAN
		Take a deep breath and realize, that 
		this is me breathing.

				  MARTIN
		This is me breating.

	Martin takes in a few breaths.

				  MARITN
		Alright, look. I gotta go.

				  DR. OATMAN
		And don't kill anyone.

				  MARTIN
		Right. Don't kill anyone...

	INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - SAME

	Felix rummages delicately around the room. He goes to the

	NIGHTSTAND

	The reunion invite.

	FELIX

	picks it up and scans it.

	EXT. GROSSE POINT HIGH SCHOOL - DUSK

	Lardner and McCullers sit it the parking lot. They watch 
	Martin and Debi pull into a space.

				  LARDNER
		He's falling for her. Look at him.

				  MCCULLERS
		He using her.

				  LARDNER
		You're wrong. Look at his face.

				  MCCULLERS
		One cannot love and kill.

				  LARDNER
			(defensive)
		I love. I kill.

	MARTIN AND DEBI

	climb out of the car. Martin, breathing deeply and wiping 
	his sweaty palms, leans against the car and tries to calm 
	himself. Eighties music echoes from the gym.

				  MARTIN
			(to himself)
		Shoulda brought my gun.

				  DEBI
		What?

	He pulls himself off the car and heads toward

	GROSSE POINTE HIGH SCHOOL

	A sprawling red-brick Gothic structure with many wings. It 
	is topped by church-like towers. It's scary.

	INT. GYM - NIGHT

	Martin and Debi enter and pause to take in the entire scene. 
	A benevolent Ronald Reagan hangs crookedly above. Basketball 
	nets are swung back, draped with crepe. Lights are half-low 
	and the music is loud. Alumni are dancing.

				  ARLENE
		Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott-
		Joseph.

				  MARTIN
		I'm Martin Blank.

				  DEBI
		Debi Newberry.

	Debi heads off into the gym, smiling back as she strands 
	Martin. Arlene rises from a card table. They have little to 
	say. Martin wasn't part of her crowd.

				  ARLENE
		Marty, you haven't changed a bit!

				  MARTIN
		Don't say that.

	Arlene gives him a NAMETAG. As a special torture, the tags 
	have YEARBOOK PHOTOS. Martin looks at the name tag 
	uncomfortably.

				  ARLENE
		We had pictures put on, that way 
		everybody knows who everybody was!

				  MARTIN
		Wonderful.

				  ARLENE
		So, what are you doing now?

				  MARTIN
		Whatever I can get away with.

	She smiles at his joke and is immediately distracted by the 
	next arrival. Martin moves off...

				  ARLENE
			(to the next person)
		Isn't it cute. It's so everybody 
		knows who everybody was!

	He circles the crowded gym. Looking for familiar faces. He 
	stops at the open bar.

				  BATENDER
		What can I make you?

				  MARTIN
		Beer.

	The bartender gets him a beer. Martin recognizes a guy at 
	the bar. He is well-appointed and shiny. He is KEN ALDRIDGE.

				  MARTIN
		Hey, Ken. How have you been?

				  KEN
			(glancing at Martin's 
			name tag)
		Hello Martin. How have you been?

				  MARTIN
		Not bad. You?

	Bob Destephano arrives next to them and orders a drink. Eye 
	contact is made.

				  KEN
		Hello, Bob.

				  MARTIN
		Hey, Bob.

	Bob turns slightly toward them. They continue in their 
	conversation.

				  KEN
		I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice 
		& Fromeyer.

				  MARTIN
		That sounds pretty interesting...

	Bob wants to join the conversation but doesn't know how.

				  KEN
		Sometimes. I'm in divorce, mainly. 
		Some property. Some personal injury.

				  MARTIN
		Those all seem kind of related...

	Bob takes another drink and mopes off, Martin watches him 
	go.

				  MARTIN
		Tragedy makes you thirsty.

	Ken chuckles. The bartender arrives with the bottle. Martin 
	grabs it and begins to move off.

				  MARTIN
		Well... I have to take this over to 
		Debi.

				  KEN
		Here. Take my card. Wait a minute... 
		here's a special one. For top-shelf 
		clients.

	Ken hands Martin a Monte Blanc pen with Ken's title and 
	business address printed on the shaft. Martin reads it and 
	puts it in his kerchief pocket.

				  MARTIN
		Thanks.

	Ken goes back to listening to the Guys at the bar.

	MARTIN

	makes his way through the upbeat crowd of well-wishers. TERRY 
	emerges like an inkspot on a clean white whirt, and intercepts 
	Martin. His angst is barely under control as he sidles up to 
	Martin.

				  TERRY
		I don't know, Blank, all these fucking 
		people, driving me crazy. Look at 
		them over there, memorializing old 
		times, acting all like it was 
		something "life-changing." And the 
		people in the National Honor Society? 
		The name tags?

	Martin shrugs.

				  TERRY
		They have special blue starts on 
		them like it fucking matters now 
		that they were in the honor club ten 
		years ago. I'm getting fucking 
		nauseous from all this sentimental 
		bullshit. It's making me sick.

	Terry stops suddenly as if he's finished. Martin reads this 
	man's nametag.

				  MARTIN
		Why are you here... Terry?

	Terry turns on a dime.

				  TERRY
		I wanted to see a couple people. But 
		I don't want to talk about the old 
		days... What did we have together, 
		Martin? Typing?

				  MARTIN
			(remembering)
		Drafting.

				  TERRY
		Yeah, I couldn't stand that fucking 
		class. But I appreciate you helping 
		me out, man.

				  MARTIN
		Don't mention it.

				  TERRY
		Yeah, thanks. Well I'm going to try 
		and get out of here, man. I'll see 
		you later.

	Terry slinks off.

	BAR - SAME

	Bob Destephano grabs two more scotches off the bar and turns 
	to leave, thoroughly morose. In his path, he finds DAN 
	KORETZKY, the good-looking side of brainy.

				  DAN
		Bob. Bob Destephano.

				  BOB
		What?

				  DAN
		I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky.

				  BOB
		Computer guy.

				  DAN
		Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's 
		dealership the other day.

				  BOB
		I sell BMW's. What do you do?

				  DAN
		Not much, actually. My software 
		company just went public so I'm 
		just... hanging out, really.

	There's a sudden lull in the conversation. Bob tries his 
	drunken hand at relating...

				  BOB
		Remember high school?

				  DAN
		Sure. Listen. Why don't you join us 
		up in the grandstands?

	Dan points up to a group of happy, laughing people. Bob walks 
	off shaking his head and smiling bitterly.

	INT. GYM - LATER

	Debi and Martin are seated at a round table with six others 
	in an area blocked off for dinner. Plates of gumbo are 
	arriving and the wine is poured. DARIUS, an African-American, 
	is in mid-conversation with AMY, who looks like she walked 
	out of a Laura Ashley catalog and sits on the other side of 
	Martin. DENNIS and MIKE are two suits in the midst of a non-
	stop sports conversation.

				  MIKE
		...You gotta hold the fans 
		responsible, though, Dennis, because 
		they're the ones putting up with the 
		mediocre product.

				  DENNIS
		I guess, though, you know, if you 
		look at it Mike, that park is a 
		beautiful park, I've gone to that 
		park many times - I've had the 
		greatest time of my life at that 
		ballpark and let's face it, I tell 
		you this, Mike, by the sixth inning, 
		if you're having the fun you should 
		be having at Tigers Stadium, you 
		don't even know what the hell's going 
		on anyway...

	They both crack up at this.

	ANGLE ON DARIUS, MARTIN, & DEBI

				  DARIUS
		Have you two been together since 
		high school?

				  DEBI
		No--

				  MARTIN
		--Yes. Actually we just bought that 
		little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine 
		Avenue... Debi's a social worker and 
		I mow down insurance claims at Aetna--

				  DEBI
		We haven't seen each other since 
		high school.

				  DARIUS
		I figured. You two look too happy 
		together. I shouldn't say that though, 
		I'm married... So, Martin-- what are 
		you up to these days? What do you do 
		for a living?

	Debi perks up; this should be interesting.

				  MARTIN
		I'm in pro-active international 
		relations. It's a very specialized 
		company. We execute economic 
		investment opportunities. Sort of 
		economic clean-up... with an emphasis 
		on personnel. It's boring, you know, 
		it's boring. I don't like to talk 
		about it because I don't think what 
		a man does necessarily reflects who 
		he is...

	Martin begins to draw strange looks from all over the table. 
	Martin may be in trouble.

				  MARTIN
		...I've always tried to refrain from 
		a black-and-white moral lexicon--you 
		know, good, bad, right, wrong--I've 
		been more interested in the gray 
		areas.

	Silence. Martin pushes on.

				  MARTIN
		But that's no way to live. I guess 
		you've got to just take the leap of 
		faith. Believe in something. Fuck 
		it.

				  DARIUS
		Sounds complicated, Martin. Are you 
		happy?

				  MARTIN
		I just have to close this one last 
		account. I'd like to just stop now, 
		today, but I can't... It's a step in 
		the right direction.

				  DEBI
		I don't know, Martin. It sounds like 
		you're feeling compromised. Live the 
		way you want. The only thing that's 
		inexcusable, to me, is cynicism. 
		That's the biggest cop-out there is.

	Nods of assent come from around the table. A brief silence, 
	and then...

				  AMY
		But wait. I still don't understand 
		what you do.

				  MARTIN
		I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.

	Debi suppresses a laugh.

				  AMY
		You do not.

				  MARTIN
		Yes I do.

				  AMY
		You don't...

				  MARTIN
		In the corporate offices.

				  AMY
		Oh... really?

				  MARTIN
		Yeah...

				  AMY
		What do you do?

				  MARTIN
		I sell biscuits to the Southland.

				  AMY
		You do not.

				  MARTIN
		It's what I do.

				  AMY
		You're so funny...

				  MARTIN
		I sell biscuits and gravy all over 
		the Southland--

				  AMY
		--Stop it--

				  MARTIN
		You know those horsey biscuit gravy 
		packets? I move all of those--

				  AMY
		--No.

				  MARTIN
		Sometimes we sell them to McDonald's 
		and just change them to special 
		barbecue sauce.

	Across the table from Martin and Debi, Dennis turns to Darius.

				  DENNIS
		What do you think about black coaching 
		in the NFL, Darius? Because I think 
		it's great.

				  DARIUS
		I don't pay much attention to 
		football.

				  MIKE
		I have to agree with you Dennis. 
		It's good to see that the owners are 
		willing to put the franchise behind 
		a black head coach or QB when for 
		years in the league they've been 
		kept out of the thinking positions 
		and relegated mainly to the physical 
		game.

				  DENNIS
		But now, you see, you have Warren 
		Moon at the helm, Cunningham, Art 
		Shell, and the coach up at 
		Minnesota...

				  MIKE
		Dennis Green. And if you remember, 
		Doug Williams was the first black 
		man to prove that on a Superbowl 
		Sunday.

	Amy leans in to Martin.

				  AMY
			(to Martin)
		I'm teaching art at Cedar Junior 
		High School.

				  DENNIS
		...Yeah, listen. Where do you stand 
		on this whole Louis Farrakhan 
		issue...?

				  DARIUS
			(facetious)
		I'm a De Klerk man myself.

	Debi nods, indicating to the deejay stand.

				  DEBI
		I'm going over to play some tunes.

	Martin watches her walk away.

	INT. GYM - GRANDSTANDS - LATER

	Dan Koretzky sits with two other FORMER-SQUARES-turned-
	handsome-fellas who now enjoy a confidence that comes with 
	early investment in Microsoft.

	Martin looks out over the milieu below, enjoying the seene. 
	He eavesdrops on a group of men from a few rows back.

	GROUP OF MEN

				  DAN
		Look at her. There it is. Jenny 
		Slater. The finest thing that ever 
		walked these halls.

				  FORMER-SQUARE #2
		I believe she married the state of 
		Maine.

				  DAN
		Yeah, he's around here somewhere. 
		What a shame. She would have looked 
		great in my fucking Bentley.

				  FORMER-SQUARE #3
		No, my friends, Jenny Beam. Not only 
		was she as fine, if not finer, than 
		Slater, but she had the "bad girl" 
		thing going for her. And the red 
		hair. C'mon.

				  DAN
		She's a paramedic in Skokie, Illinois.

				  FORMER-SQUARE #2
		You both are mistaken. Jenny Maretti 
		was the finest. No question about 
		it.

				  FORMER-SQUARE #3
		The three Jenny's. Three Jenny's. 
		All named Jenny...

				  DAN
		You know what I'm really hoping? 
		That Jenny Slater gets divorced. And 
		she's twenty-eight--

				  FORMER-SQUARE #3
		--she's got half the state of Maine--

				  DAN
		She's twenty-eight years old, with 
		two kids, she's still really really 
		fine, and I see her at a bookstore 
		or something, and she sees me for 
		what I was then, and what I am now: 
		the redemption for all her failure.

				  FORMER-SQUARE #3
		You mean the redemption for all your 
		failure.

	They ponder this. Martin looks down on the gym, concentrating 
	on Debi.

	BOB DESTEPHANO

	Dancing drunkenly, miserable, like an unbalanced orangutan.

								   CUT TO:

	INT. GYM - DEEJAY BOOTH - LATER

	Martin stands by Debi as she sits in for a set in the deejay 
	booth, on a raised stage. They are playing an old sophomoric 
	game.

				  DEBI
		Which would you rather...?

				  MARTIN
		Okay... Would you rather... commit 
		yourself sexually to a four-by-nine 
		cell with former President George 
		Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a 
		super-model for a month, or make 
		love to a otter on crank for a week?

				  DEBI
		Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, 
		clearly! I'd let the little beast 
		scratch and claw all he wants... 
		Okay. Would you rather make love to 
		the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--

				  MARTIN
		--She's not dead---

				  DEBI
		It's just a game...! Alright. Candied 
		Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest 
		across the desert with a fully 
		digested crab apple in your mouth?

				  MARTIN
		Wow. I have to give this some thought.

				  DEBI
		No time.

				  MARTIN
		Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller.

	STACEY breaks the moment, looking up at the two, horrified 
	and unsure at what she's heard.

				  STACEY
		Marty! Debi! How are you! So many 
		people came, but I never expected to 
		see you Marty. Or you Debi... I 
		mean... because of what your 
		divorce... I didn't mean to say that. 
		I just meant you look so good.

				  DEBI
		Thank you.

				  STACEY
		Do you think you could play "Too 
		Shy'" by Kaja Goo Goo?

				  DEBI
		Stacey, why don't you come up here 
		and take over for a little while?

				  STACEY
		I'd love to.

	Stacey nods thanks and makes her way up into the booth as 
	Martin and Debi make their way down.

				  DEBI
			(to Martin)
		Everybody thinks they know me now 
		that I'm divorced.

	She leads Martin toward the exit.

				  DEBI
		It's time to see you in private.

	INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY

	Martin and Debi walk down the hallway, alone together.

				  MARTIN
		Even though I left, you never left 
		me. Not just memory but a substance 
		in my blood.

				  DEBI
			(smiling)
		Like heroin?

				  MARTIN
		Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.

				  DEBI
			(enjoying this)
		Like love?

				  MARTIN
		Could be. The physical substance of 
		love.

	Debi stops.

				  DEBI
		I'll accept that. Follow me.

	Together they move into what appears to be the Nurse's Office, 
	and close the door behind them.

	INT. NURSE'S OFFICE

	Martin and Debi make wild banshee love.

	EXT. PARKING LOT - SAME

	Lardner and McCullers watch Felix into the gym.

				  MCCULLERS
		Looks like someone keeps trying to 
		do our job for us.

				  LARDNER
		If he does our job, he's our job.

				  MCCULLERS
		I get it.

	INT. GYM - SAME

	FELIX

	steps through the doorway he's standing in and strolls into 
	the crowded gym. He wears the standard khaki-pants-blue-blazer 
	combo, with no nametag. He's clearly too old for the class 
	of 1984.

	INT. HALLWAY - LATER

	Martin and Debi come out of the Nurse's Office. The post-
	coital mood is broken as they hear The Human League's "Don't 
	You Want Me, Baby?"  blasting from the gym. Martin and Debi 
	tune in on the song for a moment, unhappy at remembering 
	that particular moment in pop music history. Debi looks to 
	Martin, something must be done about it.

				  DEBI
		I'll be right back....

	Debi kisses him. They split up. Martin walks off, the happiest 
	we've seen him....

	INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY

	Bob and several others from the muscle-to-fat crew play a 
	drunken scrimmage with a papier-mache table ornament footbal 
	that is coming unwound. Bob quarterbacks and begins to recite 
	a long, complicated, and forgotten play. Martin approaches 
	from behind Bob and glides through the ad-hoc line-up, 
	continuing down the hall. Bob yells "hike" as he stares after 
	Martin, distracted. Bob's rushed upon and sacked. He lets 
	the papier-mache ball drop and crack on the floor.

	INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - LATER

	Martin walks down a silent, deserted hall of lockers and 
	classroom doors. The only sounds are his footsteps and the 
	echoed strains of Iggy Pop's "Wild Child" from the distant 
	gym. He stops at locker number 1963 and flips the dial: Right-
	back left-right again. It opens. He pops up the steel false 
	ceiling in the empty locker, fishes his hand in the opening, 
	and withdraws what he is looking for: an ancient joint. He 
	holds it up and examines the now brown and dried reefer. He 
	grinds it into dust in his hand.

	INT. HALLWAY

	Debi comes out of the gym and starts down the hall, the music 
	changed for the better.

	INT. HALLWAY - SAME

	Martin senses he is not alone. He turns to find Bob 
	Destephano. The big man holds a glass unsteadily and slurs 
	slightly when he speaks. Bob is looking sad and scary. He 
	leans into Martin

				  BOB
		So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that 
		shit again?

				  MARTIN
		Fine, Bob. How are you?

				  BOB
		Never better.

				  MARTIN
		Really?

	Bob crumbles.

				  BOB
		Ahhh... it's all fucked up. Nothing 
		adds up to nothing... you work your 
		whole life, day in and day out-- try 
		to make sense of it all. One day 
		you're twenty-seven and what do you 
		get to show for it...

				  MARTIN
		You could've been a contender, huh?

	Bob realizes he can't even express his own tragedy without 
	the use of cliches.

				  BOB
		Smart boy. Real smart. Let's see how 
		smart you are with my foot up your 
		ass! I'm gonna kick your ass!

	Martin steps to Bob.

				  MARTIN
		Why would you want to hit me, Bob? 
		Do you really believe that there's 
		some stored up conflict that needs 
		resolution between us? We don't exist. 
		There's nothing between us. So who 
		do you want to hit, Bob? It's not 
		me.

	Bob slumps against the lockers, deflated.

				  BOB
		What am I gonna do?

				  MARTIN
		What do you want to do?

				  BOB
		I want to be an actor.

				  MARTIN
		Then express yourself, Bob.

	Bob frowns, trying to think of a way to express himself.

				  MARTIN
			(catching him)
		Be honest...

	Bob backs up and lets out a huge, drunken caveman scream, 
	then stops abruptly, and smiles.

				  BOB
		Later, Martin.

	Bob backpedals down the hallway and out of sight. Martin 
	watches him stumble out of the hallway and bang through the 
	doors of a stairwell, disappearing.

	INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

	Bob slams through the doors and begins to stumble down the 
	stairs. He encounters Debi, on her way up. He glances at her 
	but does not break stride. Debi gives him wide berth, and 
	quickens her pace up the stairs...

	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Martin watches the doors swing to a stop. He exhales and 
	relaxes... AND THEN Spin-pivots on his right heel, as a BURST 
	from a silenced pistol pierces the space where his head was 
	a split-second before/ As he spins around, his right hand 
	withdraws Ken's give-away pen from his kerchief pocket, pops 
	the cap off, and drive the pen up and through the throat of 
	his attacker--

	FELIX

	impaled through the throat on the pen, his head snapped back.

	MARTIN AND FELIX

	are frozen for a moment. Blood runs quickly down the front 
	of Felix's body, off of his shoes, and on to the floor. The 
	stairwell doors band open. Martin's head turns toward the 
	sound. His eyes lock onto

	DEBI

	who is frozen, horrified for a moment. She flees.

	MARTIN

	looks back at

	FELIX

	Dead.

	THE FLOOR

	A growing pool of blood.

	MARTIN

	Looks around wildly, holding Felix up against the lockers. 
	Above the lockers is a plastic banner proclaiming

		 "SPANISH CLUB FIESTA FUN-RAISER SATURDAY JUNE 1"

	MARTIN

	rips it down from the wall with his free hand, wraps it around 
	Felix, stuffs the body into his open locker, and slams it 
	shut. He pulls off his shoes and socks, puts a sock over 
	each hand like mittens, and wipes up the small pool of blood. 
	He stuffs the socks into his pockets, takes off down the 
	hall, and bangs through the doors.

	INT. GYM - GRANDSTANDS - MOMENTS LATER

	Martin blasts through the upstairs doors to the grandstands 
	looking for Debi below. She is nowhere to be found. He scans 
	the party in progress-- It is the same frame of image as the 
	one in Oatman's office. In the middle of the floor, Terry 
	slowly turns up to meet Martin's eyes.

	MARTIN

	pulls the doors shut, and takes off down the hall.

	INT. HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

	Martin opens his locker, withdraws the corpse, and hefts it 
	over his shoulder.

	INT. STAIRWELL - A MINUTE LATER

	Brick-walled, darkly lit, and narrow. Martin bounds down the 
	steep steps with his load.

	INT. BASEMENT LOCKER ROOM HALLWAY - MINUTE LATER

	Martin hustles toward a cage door in front of him. He kicks 
	through it and dumps Felix into a canvas laundry cart on 
	casters and begins rolling.

	INT. PUMP AND FURNACE ROOM - A MINUTE LATER

	The door bangs open and light pours into the room from behind 
	Martin. He negotiates the cart over the dirt floor and stops 
	next to the furnace that heats the swimming pool. He pauses 
	and looks to the ceiling: the music from the reunion pulses 
	into the floor above him. Martin picks up a large metal bar 
	and works open the door on the hulking cast-iron furnace. A 
	white-hot blaze roars within.

	INT. GYM - NIGHT

	The party is winding down. A harried-looking Martin walks in 
	and looks around once more for Debi-- nothing.

	MARTIN'S POV

	of the Deejay booth. It is empty.

	He moves over to the bar and joins Ken Aldridge. He motions 
	to the bartender who opens a beer for him.

				  MARTIN
		Have you seen Debi Newberry?

				  KEN
		Nope.

	They both look around at the last of the reunion.

				  KEN
		The more things change, the more 
		they Goddamned well stay the same.

				  MARTIN
		I guess.

	Before Ken can get started again...

				  MARTIN
		Take care of yourself, Ken. Thanks 
		for the pen.

	Martin walks out of the gym.

	EXT. HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

	Paul is leaning against his Beemer, having a smoke.

				  PAUL
		What the hell happened to you?

				  MARTIN
		I was catching up with Bob Destephano.

				  PAUL
		As long as you had a good time.

	Beat. Martin scans the lot for sign of Debi.

				  PAUL
		What now? Chase the girl?

	There is a beat of silence. Nothing seems worth saying.

				  MARTIN
		It didn't work out.

				  PAUL
		That's too bad.

				  MARTIN
		I have to get my head back into my 
		work.

				  PAUL
		Work's good for the soul.

	Martin gets up to leave.

				  MARTIN
		When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.

				  PAUL
		See you in ten years.

	Paul watches him leave. He almost stops him, but thinks better 
	of it.

	INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - NIGHT

	Martin hunches over his briefcase that lays open on the bed.

	MARTIN PULLS

	THE DOSSIER from the briefcase. It's seal is broken, but the 
	contents remain enclosed... He withdraws the package and 
	dumps the contents on the bed. His face registers muted shock.

				  MARTIN
		Dumb fucking luck...

	THE CONTENTS

	include various photos of MR. NEWBERRY, Mr. Newberry with 
	Debi, and the house. The photos are mingled with official-
	looking papers including credit reports, medical records, 
	etc... Newberry's life.

	He cocks his head toward the door anticipating a... KNOCK. 
	He freezes, then plucks a gun tapped under a desk, and moves 
	toward the door, pointing. Halfway to the door, his face and 
	body slacken. He lobs the gun onto the bed. With everything 
	gone wrong, there is nothing left to defend. He goes to the 
	door and opens it, body relaxed, expecting a bullet...

	Debi moves past him into the room. She is completely calm.

				  DEBI
		He was trying to kill you, right!

				  MARTIN
		Yes.

				  DEBI
		Not the other way around...?

				  MARTIN
		No.

				  DEBI
		Is it something you've done?

				  MARTIN
		It's something I do...

	Beat.

				  MARTIN
		...Professionally...

	Beat.

				  MARTIN
		...About five years now.

				  DEBI
			(stunned)
		Get the fuck outta here.

				  MARTIN
		Seriously, when I left, I joined the 
		Army and took the service exam. They 
		found my psych results fit a certain 
		profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" 
		would be the best way to describe 
		it... I was loaned out to a CIA-
		sponsored program. It's called 
		"mechanical operations." We sort of 
		found each other...

				  DEBI
		You're a government spook?

	Martin says nothing.

				  MARTIN
		I was, but no... yes... I was before, 
		but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, 
		really. The idea of governments, 
		nations, it's mostly a public 
		relations theory at this point, 
		anyway. But I'll tell you something, 
		until about five months ago, I really 
		enjoyed my work.

				  DEBI
		Jesus Christ!

				  MARTIN
		Then I started losing my taste for 
		it. Which usually means your time is 
		up. But then I realized it was 
		something entirely different... I 
		started getting the sneaking, dark 
		suspicion that maybe there was... 
		meaning to life.

				  DEBI
		Okay. Great, Martin, that's just 
		great. Meaning to life... Mmm....

				  MARTIN
		Like, that there's a point? An organic 
		connection between all living things.

				  DEBI
		Let me help you along, Martin. You're 
		a sociopath!

				  MARTIN
			(defensive)
		A sociopath kills for no reason. I 
		kill for money.

				  DEBI
		You never could have kept this from 
		me.

				  MARTIN
		I was leaving.

				  DEBI
		That's probably a good idea.

				  MARTIN
		Will you come with me?

				  DEBI
		I'm staying here.

				  MARTIN
		What if I come back?

				  DEBI
		I'll hide.

	She goes for the door.

				  MARTIN
		Don't go.

	She stops at the door. Slowly, she turns.

				  DEBI
		You don't get to have me. You are a 
		monster, I'm a human being. We're 
		not going to mate.

				  MARTIN
		You don't understand...

				  DEBI
		That's because I speak human, and 
		you speak monster.

	Debi bolts out of the room. Martin is left alone.

	Martin looks over at his gear on the bed. After a beat, he 
	walks slowly over and surveys his tools. He picks up a 
	cleaning rag and begins to go over the weapons, absently 
	singing to himself...

				  MARTIN
		"What's up Doc? What's cookin'? What's 
		up Doc, are you lookin'...?

	INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - DAWN

	Morning light comes through the slit in the curtains, picking 
	up four or five exquisitely clean guns are laid out on the 
	bed, almost geometrically spaced. Martin lifts one at a time, 
	checking their bores and actions...

	INT. COUNTRY SQUIRE - MORNING

	Lardner and McCullers gear up. They each finish loading the 
	last of many clips...

	EXT. MICHIGAN HIGHWAY - MORNING

	Grocer and Company, not in a Ford Passenger Van, veer off 
	onto an exit ramp. Grocer has assembled a team of about nine. 
	They draw different guns from their kit bags and begin 
	loading...

	INT. COUNTRY SQUIRE - SAME

	Lardner and McCullers jam clips into their service autos and 
	knock the slides...

	INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - SAME

	Martin finished loading his guns, and puts them in his case. 
	He shuts it and moves for the door. On the way out he stops 
	and looks himself in the mirror before exiting.

	EXT. THREE DIFFERENT ROADS - INTERCUT

	Each car whooshes by camera, on its way to the inevitable...

	INT. EASTWEST HOLDING COMPANY - INTERCUT

	Marcella has a cordless tucked between her shoulder and ear, 
	and holds a two-gallon gas can. She moves from room to room 
	pouring gasoline onto the computers, desks, and piles of 
	paper stacked on the floor. She adds a splash to her copy of 
	"Women Who Run With the Wolves."

				  MARCELLA
		I'm bringing down the office now.

	She picks up her hard drive and smashes it on the floor. 
	It's cathartic.

	INTERCUT WITH MARTIN IN THE TOWN CAR -

				  MARTIN
		I'll put things right. Then I'll 
		find you.

	Silence on the line.

				  MARCELLA
			(apprehensive)
		Uh... why?

	Martin finishes his weapons check, and pulls out the dossier.

				  MARTIN
		Don't worry. I left you a little 
		something under your desk.

	Martin hangs up.

	Marcella goes to it and pulls loose from underneath a shrink-
	wrapped brick of $100 bills, probably a $100,000 or so.

				  MARCELLA
		All right!!

	INT. MARTIN'S TOWN CAR

	Martin makes his way down the road to the Newberry's. In the 
	distance, he sees a lone figure jogging on the shoulder, 
	away from him.

	INT. GROCER'S VAN - SAME

	Grocer and Company are parked off to the side, watching 
	Newberry, in the distance, jog toward them. A SNIPER prepares 
	to blow Newberry's head off.

	INT. MARTIN'S TOWN CAR - SAME

	As he approaches the figure, he recognizes it as Newberry, 
	he accelerates.

	INT. GROCER'S VAN - SAME

	Grocer spots Martin's car speeding at Newberry.

				  GROCER
		Oh shit...

	EXT. ROAD - SAME

	Newberry stops jogging and turns to face the Town Car bearing 
	down on him. His face goes slack, expecting to be creamed.

	INT. TOWN CAR - SAME

	Martin roars straight at Newberry, his engine shrieking. As 
	the distance between them turns from yards to feet... Martin 
	swerves hard, just missing Newberry and comes to a halt next 
	to him, blocking the Sniper's line of fire. After a moment, 
	Newberry opens the passenger door.

				  NEWBERRY
		What the fuck is the matter with 
		you?!

				  MARTIN
		Well, I was hired to kill you. It's 
		what I do, and come to think of it, 
		I told you that, but... Okay. I'm 
		not going to do it. Get in the car.

	He does. They drive on.

				  MARTIN
		It's either because I'm in love with 
		your daughter, or because I have a 
		new-found respect for life. Or both. 
		But I don't know.

	INT. GROCER'S VAN - SAME

	Grocer and company watch in amazement.

	GROCER'S P.O.V.

	of Martin's car disappearing into Newberry's long and wooded 
	driveway.

				  GROCER
		That punk is either in love with 
		that guy's daughter or he has new 
		found respect for life... Let's go.

	EXT. NEWBERRY HOUSE - SAME

	Martin pulls up in front and stops. Both men scramble out 
	and head toward the front door at a quick clip. Newberry is 
	shaken; Martin seems at ease, at home in his element.

				  NEWBERRY
		Why? I build cars! They're paying 
		you to kill me? Why?

				  MARTIN
		It was a cost-cutting effort. They 
		can't afford a recall.

				  NEWBERRY
		It was a leaky sunroof! A design 
		flaw! I reported a leaky sunroof! 
		You want to kill me because of that?

				  MARTIN
		It's not me! Why does everybody think 
		it's personal?!

	They go through the front door and shut it behind them.

	INT. GROCER'S VAN - SAME

	Grocer drops the van into gear and heads toward the driveway.

	INT. COUNTRY SQUIRE - SAME

	Lardner and McCullers approach the scene. They get within 
	viewing distance in time to see Grocer's Town Car turn into 
	the driveway.

				  LARDNER
		We'll go in through the woods.

	INT. NEWBERRY HOUSE

	Martin's briefcase is open on the large oak table. The 
	contents of the dossier are spilled out onto the table. 
	Newberry and Debi watch him, dumbstruck, as he draws a huge 
	Desert Eagle automatic and jerks back the slide. He turns to 
	Debi.

				  MARTIN
		I was sitting in my house on prom 
		night wearing that Goddamned rented 
		tuxedo, a corsage in one hand, a 
		bottle of champagne in the other. So 
		I was just sitting there, and then 
		the whole night flashed before my 
		eyes, and it struck me like a bullet 
		in the head-- I realized, finally, 
		and for the first time, that... I 
		wanted to kill somebody. So I figured 
		because I loved you so much, that'd 
		it'd be a good idea if I didn't see 
		you anymore. But now I'm different.

	He turns and points the gun at the front door and FIRES two 
	shots through it, leaving two baseball-size holes in the 
	door.

	Martin bolts out of the room toward the back of the house. 
	Debi and Newberry run as fast as they can away from Martin. 
	Newberry opens the front door, preparing to rush out with 
	Debi. They stop at what they see:

	NEWBERRY'S & DEBI'S P.O.V.

	As ASSASSIN lies on the porch, shot dead through the door by 
	Martin. IN one hand is a gun, in the other is a Fuller Brush 
	kit. Two men, GROCER and an ASSASSIN, clamber out of van, 
	their guns rising up fast toward us.

	Debi pulls Newberry inside, slams the front door, and locks 
	it. They dive away just before ten rounds hit the door from 
	outside.

	INT. KITCHEN - SAME

	Martin rushes toward the back door which is already opening. 
	A barrel comes through and FIRES at Martin. Martin pulls 
	back behind the refrigerator and returns FIRE. An ASSASSIN 
	comes through the door in a crouch and takes cover behind 
	the cooking island. Martin, yelling back to Debi...

				  MARTIN
		I'm in love with you. I know we can 
		make this work!

	MARTIN

	rushes toward the island, grabbing an iron skillet off the 
	range, and holds it up like a crossing-guard stop sign. He 
	steps toward the hidden Assassin just as the Assassin rises 
	SHOOTING. The skillet takes two rounds before Martin hammers 
	the Assassin's head with it. Debi and Newberry arrive in the 
	kitchen.

	NEW ANGLE - LOW DUTCH

	Martin bashes the skillet into the Assassin's skull, which 
	is beyond our view. He rises spattered with blood and looks 
	at Debi.

				  MARTIN
		I was afraid to commit to a 
		relationship, but now I know I'm 
		ready to make it happen.

	Martin drops the skillet and grabs Newberry and Debi gently 
	be the wrists.

				  MARTIN
		I just need time to change.

	He ushers them past the bludgeoned corpse and up the back 
	stairs. He spins and FIRES twice back down the stairs at 
	another ASSASSIN coming up, blowing his arms off.

	HALLWAY

	He leads them quickly.

				  MARTIN
		It's not easy for me. I was raised 
		to close off, to control my 
		feelings...

	He takes them into a bedroom, and BLOWS AWAY, an ASSASSIN 
	coming in through the window, emptying his auto. Martin pushes 
	Debi and Newberry into an adjoining bathroom. He backs out 
	through the doorway.

				  MARTIN
		Lock the door.

	They do. Martin starts away, but stops to get something 
	straight.

				  MARTIN
		I wasn't raised in a loving 
		environment.
			(beat)
		But that's not an excuse. It's a 
		reason.

	INT. FOYER

	Martin corners the banister and springs half-way down the 
	stairs, then hears the front door begin to open.

				  MARTIN
		My soul was empty--

	Martin jams in another clip, and chambers a round. He sees 
	Grocer beginning to slip in.

				  MARTIN
		--and it's up to me to fill it.

	Martin FIRES the twelve-round clip into the door until the 
	slide locks back empty again. Grocer backs out fast. Martin 
	hears a gun REPORT from upstairs and moves back toward it, 
	tossing the spent weapon.

	INT. BEDROOM

	An ASSASSIN slams his body against the bathroom door while 
	Debi and Newberry scream from within. Martin flies at him. 
	The Assassin wheels on Martin FIRING. Martin pivots out of 
	the line of fire, still moving forward. He takes hold of 
	Assassin's neck and snaps it. Martin drops the corpse.

				  MARTIN
			(through the door)
		It's okay. It's Martin The door begins 
		to open revealing Debi and Newberry.

				  MARTIN
		I know what I do isn't moral, per 
		se, but if you could just look past 
		that, you'd see a man worth loving.

				  GROCER (O.S.)
		Don't listen to him, he's a 
		professional.

	Martin stops short and cocks his head toward Grocer's muffled 
	voice coming from the vent. Grocer continues...

				  GROCER (O.S.)
		You're breaking my heart down here, 
		Blank. I can't shoot through the 
		tears.

	Martin, incensed, bends down and takes the gun from the dead 
	man. He runs out of the bedroom, gun poised for a kamikaze 
	firefight...

	EXT. NEWBERRY HOUSE - SAME

	Lardner and McCullers are poised outside the front door, 
	about to enter the mix. McCullers peers through the window.

				  LARDNER
		Did you see Blank in there?

				  MCCULLERS
		No...

				  LARDNER
		Good. For a second there I thought 
		we were in trouble.

	INT. NEWBERRY FOYER - CONTINUOUS

	MARTIN

	reaches the top of the front stairs to find Grocer heading 
	up the stairs at him. They lift their guns at each other to 
	FIRE, when they hear...

	LARDNER AND MCCULLERS

	power through the front door, guns BLAZING at floor-level, 
	ala Butch and Sundance.

	Martin and Grocer, above, spin on them instinctively, and 
	FIRE, killing them. Grocer dives off of the stairs and rolls 
	out of view.

	KITCHEN - INTERCUT

	GROCER

	heads up the back stairs.

	MARTIN

	works his way toward Grocer, moving with stealth toward the 
	kitchen.

	GROCER

	hears him and starts back down.

	Martin dives behind the cooking island just as Grocer comes 
	out of the stairwell blasting. They unload at each other as 
	Grocer runs a pattern across the kitchen, FIRING at Martin, 
	crouched, who BLASTS back. Grocer vaults himself through the 
	air toward a serving window from the kitchen to the dining 
	room, still firing.

	C.U. - MARTIN'S GUN - SLOW MOTION

	The last casing floats out of the chamber into the air, and 
	the slide on the auto locks back-- empty.

	NORMAL SPEED

	GROCER

	Flying through the air disappearing through the shuttered 
	serving window, his flight carrying him past a television 
	that sits on a lazy susan.

	MARTIN AND GROCER - INTERCUT

	Martin and Grocer sit on the floor, backs up against opposite 
	side of the counter-- Martin in the kitchen and Grocer in 
	the dining room. The hulking old television sits on the 
	counter above and between them.

	Martin looks up and spies the TELEVISION

				  GROCER
		...How about I sell you two rounds 
		for a hundred grand a piece?

				  MARTIN
		Okay.

	Martin takes out a checkbook, and tears one free. He wads it 
	into a loose ball and tosses it over the counter.

	BALLED CHECK

	sails over the television and comes down, bouncing off 
	Grocer's head and into his lap.

				  MARTIN
		There you go. I left it blank.

				  GROCER
		Excellent. Here they come.

	Grocer pulls two rounds from the clip of his semi-automatic 
	and pushes the clip back into the gun. Grocer arcs the TWO 
	BULLETS into the air.

	MARTIN

	rises and springs at the television, gripping it. The TWO 
	BULLETS sail past his head.

	GROCER

	begins to rise from his side of the counter, cocking his 
	gun.

	MARTIN

	puts all his weight and motion behind the television. Martin 
	and the television careen off of the counter toward Grocer.

	GROCER

	gets off one round before

	MARTIN

	flies onto Grocer, smashing the seventy-five pound television 
	over his Goddamn head. Martin sails past the collision, 
	landing on his back in the dining room. He rolls over to see

	GROCER

	Body crumpled, neck is snapped, head encased in the shattered 
	picture tube. He is dead.

	MARTIN

	runs up the front stairs, retrieving the spent gun he 
	discarded earlier, and heads into the bedroom.

	INT. BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

	Martin opens the bathroom door. Inside, Debi sits on the 
	edge of the tub, her face in her hands. Newberry kneels with 
	his arms around her. Martin takes this in, and walks back 
	into the bedroom. Newberry stands and follows him out.

	MARTIN AND NEWBERRY

	MARTIN a bloody, tattered mess, wipes off the gun and puts 
	it into Newberry's hand. Newberry, in total shock, grips it. 
	Martin looks past Newberry.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	Of Debi, head in hands.

				  MARTIN (V.O.)
		Debi... will you marry me?

	Debi doesn't look up. After a moment, she reaches out, head 
	still down, and closes the bathroom door...

	INT. RADIO STATION - DAY

	Outside is a Michigan autumn. Debi sits at her console, 
	bringing in the mike as she fades out of a tune...

				  DEBI
		This is WRFN Radio Free Newberry 
		cause that's what it does. Bringing 
		you New Ones for the Nineties, a 
		fresh new format designed to pull 
		you out of what's come before, and 
		reel you into what's coming soon--

	THE PHONE CONSOLE

	lights up with an incoming cal...

				  DEBI
		I tell you what's coming soon for 
		me, or at least what I dreamed this 
		morning in that weird time just before 
		you actually wake up. But first this 
		commercial. Back after this...

	She pushes a couple of buttons, slaps a cartridge in a player, 
	and answers the phone. We hear the commercial over the studio 
	monitor:

				  ANNOUNCER
		Don't miss the show of the season at 
		Bilkin Community Center! "Brigadoon!" 
		A musical for all ages! "Brigadoon," 
		starring Carol Plummer, Thomas 
		Canchola, Bob Destephano, and Lee 
		Ordman!...

	Debi picks up the phone.

				  DEBI
		RFN...

	Her face goes slack as she listens... not good, not bad... 
	Then she hangs up slowly. The commercial ends. A moment of 
	dead air, then she snaps to.

				  DEBI
		Hey out there... Okay... I'm going 
		to finish up that fantasy later. 
		First I'll give you an hour of nonstop 
		music... If I don't come back on 
		after that-- well, nevermind.

	Debi turns on a reel-to-reel, and leaves.

	EXT. FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT HOUSE - DAY

	Debi pulls up and gets out. She begins toward the door but 
	stops dead when she sees

	MARTIN

	sitting on the front steps.

	Debi moves slowly up the walk and sits next to him on the 
	porch. They sit, gazing out over the grass and trees beyond. 
	After a while...

				  DEBI
		This will never work out.

	She turns to him, serious.

				  DEBI
		You kill people.
			(beat)

				  MARTIN
		I have no illusions about the future. 
		What is, is. We make choices. And we 
		become the sum total of our choices. 
		I can live with that.

				  DEBI
		Other people can't.

	Martin looks at her earnestly... And smiles ever so slightly. 
	She does the same, and then just a little wider. He the same. 
	They turn back out to face the lawn, and they share a laugh...

SEATTLE 1988

EXT. FRONT YARD.  DAY.

        Slow motion. Armed troops in black uniforms pour out of
        unmarked vans and swarm across a lawn in a middle class
        residential neighborhood. Yuppie neighbours look on in
        shock, confused. Two of the troops carry a battering ram
        to the front door of a white two-storey house. A leashed
        Rottweiler snarls and barks. In position, their comrades
        point M-16s into first-floor windows, ready to be
        ambushed. Pan into a window in the kitchen. An
        attractive woman in her thirties is making breakfast.

        Now, in regular motion, the battering ram breaks open the
        front door. The woman, startled, drops her spatula.

INT. MURPHY RESIDENCE. DAY.

                                WOMAN
                                (screams)
                    Oough! Ahhh!

                                SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                                (to others)
                    Upstairs.

        Troops pour into the house.

                                WOMAN
                    What's going on? What's the matter?
                    Who are you?

        The troops, and one or two trenchcoated agents, continue
        entering the house and heading upstairs, still with rifles
        ready.

                                WOMAN
                    Hey!

        Upstairs, crowded in the narrow hallway, the troops
        descend on a bedroom.

                                WOMAN
                                (off camera)
                    Dade! Dade!

                                AGENT
                    Knock it down.

        The battering ram knocks down a bedroom door.

INT. COURTROOM.

        The prosecutor, a woman of about forty, gives her closing
        argument blandly. She'd rather be somewhere else.

                                PROSECUTOR
                    The defendant, Dade Murphy, who calls
                    himself "Zero Cool", has repeatedly
                    committed criminal acts of a malicious
                    nature. This defendant possesses a
                    superior intelligence, which he uses to a
                    destructive and antisocial end. His
                    computer virus crashed one thousand five
                    hundred and seven computer systems,
                    including Wall Street trading systems,
                    single handedly causing a seven point drop
                    in the New York Stock Market.

        As she speaks, the camera pans across the court, panning
        down and stopping on the defendant: eleven year old Dade
        Murphy.

        Fast forward to the sentencing.

                                JUDGE
                    Dade Murphy, I hereby fine your family
                    forty-five thousand dollars...

        The court gasps, Dade's father winces

                                JUDGE
                    ...and sentence you to probation, under
                    which you are forbidden to own or operate
                    a computer or touch tone telephone, until
                    the day of your eighteenth birthday.

        Now Dade winces, in fact we almost expect him to cry.

        Opening credits roll to a backdrop of Dade and his family
        and lawyer fighting through a gaggle of journalists and
        photographers, in slow motion, and driving away.

                        SEVEN YEARS LATER.

        Aboard a jetliner, Dade Murphy is staring blankly out the
        window, wearing headphones. Exterior view from the
        aircraft of approaching New York City. The view becomes a
        direct overhead of the buildings and streets of the city,
        which then metamorphoses (through animation) into chips
        and digital signals on a stylised computer board. The
        title logo.

INT. DADE'S ROOM.

        Segue to Dade Murphy, now 18, wearing mirrorshades indoors
        and at night, working on his new computer. His mother
        calls him.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                                (off camera)
                    Dade?

                                DADE
                    Yeah, mom?

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    What are you doing?

                                DADE
                                (after a semi-pregnant pause)
                    I'm taking over a TV network.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    Finish up, honey, and get to sleep. And happy
                    birthday.

INT. OTV STUDIOS.

        In the OTV Studios security department, a phone rings, a
        man answers nervously.

                                NORM
                    Security, uh Norm, Norm speaking.

                                DADE
                    Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from
                    Accounting. I just had a power surge here at
                    home that wiped out a file I was working on.
                    Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know
                    anything about computers?

                                NORM
                    Uhhmmm... uh gee, uh...

                                DADE
                    Right, well my BLT drive on my computer just
                    went AWOL, and I've got this big project due
                    tomorrow for Mr. Kawasaki, and if I don't get
                    it in, he's gonna ask me to commit Hari
                    Kari...

                                NORM
                    Uhhh.. ahahaha...

                                DADE
                    Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management
                    techniques.
                                (pause)
                    Could you, uh, read me the number on the
                    modem?

                                NORM
                    Uhhhmm...

                                DADE
                    It's a little boxy thing, Norm, with switches
                    on it... lets my computer talk to the one
                    there...

                                NORM
                    212-555-4240.

        Dade goes to work on OTV. He closes his eyes and a flurry
        of half-second video clips from old TV shows flashes by.
        He opens his eyes. His screen says ENTERING ARPS 331 and
        then wipes to another screen. Automated Record Playback
        System. There is a graphic representation of the
        station's automatic videotape changer. Dade turns on his
        TV set and turns to OTV. It is running a Rush-Limbaugh
        type TV show.

                                COMMENTATOR
                                (on TV)
                    ...so-called American Indians, Latinos and
                    Blacks come from a genetically mediocre
                    stock...

                                DADE
                    Yak yak yak. Get a job!

        Dade presses a key on his keyboard. The Video Changer
        diagram lights up in red. At the station, a robotic arm
        selects a videotape from a huge rack of thousands of
        tapes.  The "America First" tape slides out of the VTR and
        is replaced by an episode of "The Outer Limits" as Dade
        watches, drinks Coke and smiles, full of himself.

                                TV
                    You are about to experience the awe and
                    mystery, which reaches from the inner mind,
                    to... The Outer Limits.

                                DADE
                    Yesssss!

        Suddenly, the ARPS screen is replaced by an ominous
        message:

                        U HAVE TREAD
                        UPON MY DOMAIN &
                        MUST NOW SUFFER
                        WHO R U?

                                DADE
                    Hey! What?

        He starts to type ZERO...

                                DADE
                    No, wait.

        Dade types:

                        CRASH OVERRIDE.
                        WHO WANTS TO KNOW?

        Dade's screen dissolves into:

                        ACID BURN

                                DADE
                    Unbelievable. A hacker!

        Then the screen changes again:

                        ACID BURN
                        SEZ LEAVE B 4
                        U R EXPUNGED

        "The Outer Limits" suddenly flashes off.

                                DADE
                    Yeah, okay "Acid Burn", that's enough.

        Dade starts hacking. Apparently so does Acid Burn. The
        tape changer machines at OTV are swamped, sometimes
        fighting over the same tape. The program on TV keeps
        changing.

        The message comes up on Dade's computer screen:

                        I WILL
                        SWAT U LIKE
                        THE FLY U R

        More dueling tape changers, more half second video clips.
        Another message.

                        I WILL
                        SNAP YOUR BACK
                        LIKE A TOOTHPICK

        As the duel continues, Dade types back a taunt of his own:

                        MESS WITH THE BEST
                        DIE LIKE THE REST

        One last from Acid Burn:

                        YOU ARE
                        TERMINATED

        Then his own computer confirms for him that the connection
        is terminated.

                                DADE
                    Shit on me!

        Next morning. Mrs. Murphy is unpacking. Dade emerges
        from his room in a housecoat. He makes a beeline (dodging
        moving boxes) for the fridge.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    Good morning. You unpack your stuff yet?

                                DADE
                    Mm-hmm.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    Up all night again, huh?

                                DADE
                    Can this wait until both my eyes are open,
                    please?

        Dade's mom picks up the phone, mocking a call to the
        building superintendent.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll
                    sleep normal hours? He's been playing with
                    his computer all night for a solid week.
                                (pause)
                    Well yes, he could be playing with himself.
                    Mmm hmm. Yes I'll ask. Dade, you like girls,
                    don't you?

                                DADE
                    Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as
                    charming as you yet.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    You haven't been doing anything stupid, right,
                    Dade?
                                (louder)
                    Right, Dade?!

                                DADE
                    Right, mom. And I'm still a virgin!

        Dade slams the bathroom door. Mrs. Murphy quickly checks
        his room. Dade is showering.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                                (angry, through the bathroom door)
                    You hooked it up to the phone, didn't you?
                    Dade! Turn the shower off! You screw up
                    again and you won't get into college!

        She pauses and regains some of her cool.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    I'm sorry we had to move in your senior year.
                    I didn't want to sell the house but I had to
                    take this new job, you know that. You're
                    going to love New York, it's the city that
                    never sleeps!

EXT. NEW YORK CITY.

        We enjoy several views of New York, the morning sun
        shining between skyscrapers, neon signs that stay lit day
        and night. Dade emerges from the ground-floor apartment
        on rollerblades and skates down the street to school.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL.

        At school, hundreds of teenagers converse, move around,
        head to class.  Dade looks lost among them. He walks up
        to a skinny latino kid in a faux leopard-skin muscle
        shirt. The kid is on a pay-phone, speaking in Spanish.

                                DADE
                    Excuse me.

                                KID
                    Yo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.

                                DADE
                    Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the
                    principal's office.

                                KID
                    Sorry, I can't help you, okay?

        Now Dade really looks lost. He heads off in search of the
        office.

INT. OFFICE.

        Dade is filling out a form.

                                GIRL
                    Do you have your transfer forms?

        Dade stares at her, stunned. The girl has a decidedly
        unconventional appearance, yet is a first-rate beauty.

                                GIRL
                    It's a relatively straightforward question.

        Dade notices her lips, and in his imagination launches
        into a flurry of half-second video clips and art bites,
        all involving lips and kissing.

                                GIRL
                    Do you speak English?

                                DADE
                    Sorry, you wanted...?

                                GIRL
                    I wanted transfer forms.

        He gives them to her.

                                GIRL
                    Thank you.

        She starts leaving. He doesn't.

                                GIRL
                    Are you coming?

        Dade clues in, gets up and follows her. She takes him on
        a brief tour.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDOR.

                                GIRL
                    The gym is through there, and the cafeteria is
                    through there.

                                DADE
                    Great. Cool.
                                (pause)
                    What's your name?

                                GIRL
                    Kate. Kate Libby.

        They arrive at a classroom.

                                KATE
                    Here's your class.

                                DADE
                    My... class. You mean I'm not in your class?

                                KATE
                    No, you're not in my class.

        Kate starts away.

                                DADE
                    Give me time!

        A guy in the halls notices Dade.

                                GUY
                    Hey, you new?

                                DADE
                    Yeah.

                                GUY
                    Tell him about the pool, Kate.

                                DADE
                    Pool?

                                KATE
                    Yeah, there's an Olympic size swimming pool up
                    on the roof. Take the stairs over there.

                                DADE
                    Yeah! Sure.

        Kate starts away again.

                                DADE
                    Thanks!

EXT. SCHOOL ROOFTOP.

        Dade enters, and lets the door slam behind him. Across the
        roof, a dozen or so geeky looking kids are looking over
        the edge, apparently trying to get someone's attention.
        One of them notices Dade.

                                GEEK
                    Hey! Hold the door!

        He's too late. The geeks look pretty angry. There is no pool.

                                Dade
                                (realizing he's been had)
                    No pool.

        Dade tries the door but it's locked. He hammers it with
        his palm, furious. Above, thunder roars and it begins
        raining.

INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR.

        Dade is soaking wet, and trudges among his classmates
        leaving a muddy trail. A three-second video clip rolls
        through his mind: it is a screaming woman being strangled
        in an old movie. He walks past Kate, who giggles.

                                KATE
                    Oh my God! He found the pool.

INT. SCHOOL COMPUTER LAB.

        The kids are all seated at computer workstations. Dade
        is hacking, the latino kid who was on the phone to
        Venezuela is running a demo involving dirty-dancing
        skeletons.

                                TEACHER
                    I'm Mr. Simpson. And I'm subbing for Ms.
                    Bayliss who was arrested at the anti-fur
                    rally. I know some of you kids got computers
                    at home. But these are school property,
                    people, and I don't want to see any gum stuck
                    to 'em. Chapter 1. Designing graphical
                    interface...

        Meanwhile, the latino kid notices that Dade has been
        looking up Kate Libby's school records. And hacking
        himself into her advanced English class.

EXT. SCHOOL QUAD.

        It's after school, kids are heading home, Dade too. The
        latino kid notices Dade and catches up with him.

                                KID
                    So, um, what's your interest in Kate Libby,
                    eh? Academic? Purely sexual?

                                DADE
                    Homicidal?

                                KID
                    What's up, man? I'm the Phreak!

        The name rings no bells with Dade.

                                PHREAK
                    The Phantom Phreak? The king of Nynex? I
                    know you play the game.

        Another kid, younger and a little geeky looking, runs up
        to Dade and The Phantom Phreak.

                                JOEY
                    Phreakphreakphreakphreakphreak,

                                PHREAK
                                (slaps Joey)
                    Joey, Joey...

                                JOEY
                    What? whatwhatwhat?

                                PHREAK
                    One more "dude" out of you and I'm gonna slap
                    the shit outa you, okay? Now I'm trying to
                    save you from yourself but you gotta stop
                    letting your mama dress you, man!
                                (To Dade):
                    Check it...

        Phreak starts to hand Dade a flyer.

                                JOEY
                                (interrupting)
                    I need a handle, man. I don't have an
                    identity until I have a handle.

                                PHREAK
                    You know, you're right about that.
                                (to Dade)
                    Check it, Friday.

        Phreak hands Dade a flyer for Cyberdelia.

                                JOEY
                    Alright. How about the Master of Disaster,
                    huh?

                                PHREAK
                    You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless.

        Phreak walks away.

                                JOEY
                    Ultra Laser.
                                (desperate)
                    Doctor Doom!

EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET VILLAGE. NIGHT.

        Dade rolls in on rollerblades.  Street vendors hawk
        computer parts and bootleg software. A bootleg music
        vendor catches Dade's attention.

                                CEREAL
                    Check this out, each and every one of you.
                    Compilation tape, of my own making. I call
                    this the "Greatest Zooks Album". Featuring
                    artists like, well I got some Hendrix on
                    there, some Joplin, Mama Cass, Belushi... all
                    great artists that asphyxiated on their own
                    vomit!

        The small crowd around him finally gets the joke.

                                CEREAL
                    Can't get this in stores, man, I made it!

        Dade wheels into Cyberdelia, which just happens to be
        equipped with a ramp down to its main floor for the
        benefit of skaters. The place pounds with loud, bassy
        techno music and coloured light. Video monitors with
        psychedelic patterns complete the atmopshere. There is a
        video game with a huge screen.  Phreak is at a pay phone.

                                OPERATOR
                                (on phone)
                    Please deposit five dollars for the first
                    minute.

        Phreak holds a small box up to the receiver, presses a
        button, and the box emits a series of tones.

                                OPERATOR
                    Thank you.

                                PHREAK
                    Nonono, thank YOU!

        Dade checks out the scene. Kate is playing the big video
        game. Dade skates up to her. She loses her last man.
        She's got the high score, in fact her name dominates the
        top-10 list.

                                DADE
                    That's a nice score for a girl.

                                KATE
                                (irritated by Dade's presence)
                    Think you can do better?

                                DADE
                    I'll give it a shot.

        Kate yields the controls to Dade, who begins playing.
        Kate's boyfriend looks on from a mezzanine several feet
        above.

                                CURTIS
                    Is this kid bothering you, Kate?

                                DADE
                    Sorry, can I get some room here?

                                CURTIS
                    Yeah.
                                (to Kate)
                    Why don't you come up here?

        Kate obliges and joins Curtis.  Dade continues playing.
        He plays brilliantly. The game is a flashy 3-D high-speed
        chase game with lots of surprises. Dade loses, but his
        high score is about to come up.

                                CURTIS
                    He's good!

        Dade's score comes up. He's in the #1 position. Phreak
        is amazed.

                                DADE
                                (to Kate)
                    Well, it looks like I'm on top.

        Kate, defeated, leaves. Curtis follows.

                                PHREAK
                    Congratulations. No one's ever beat her
                    before. You just made an enemy for life.
                                (to someone else)
                    Boy meets world. Let's go?

EXT. OUTSIDE CYBERDELIA. NIGHT.

        Kate and Curtis are sucking face, oblivious to the busy
        world around them. Dade and Phreak watch, more than a
        little disgusted.

                                DADE
                    Who's that?

                                PHREAK
                    Curtis.

                                DADE
                    And what's he do?

                                PHREAK
                    That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks
                    slick all day.

        Kate and Curtis start to take off on Curtis' motorcycle.
        Kate and Dade make eye contact briefly. The motorcycle
        speeds off into the night.

INT. DADE'S ROOM.

        The clock says it's 4:16. As the camera pans up to Dade,
        it changes to 4:17. Dade is hacking again. It's the
        school's administration system. Dade schedules a test of
        the school sprinkler system for 9:30am.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDIR.

        Dade stands alone in the hall, watching the time closely.
        Phreak rounds a corner and meets Dade.

                                PHREAK
                    What's up?

        Dade doesn't answer. He watches the time a couple of more
        seconds, then opens an umbrella. Immediately the fire
        sprinklers turn on. Phreak starts getting drenched. He
        realizes what is happening.

                                PHREAK
                                (amused and highly impressed)
        Oh my God. You...

        A bell rings and students pour out into the halls by the
        hundreds. They're all being showered on. A tall
        cheerleader bounces by Phreak, pushing her pom-pom in his
        face.

                                PHREAK
                    Way cool!
                                (to Dade)
                    You saw that?

        Dade nods in the affirmative.

        Kate walks up to Dade, also understanding what has
        happened.

                                KATE
                    What the hell is going on?

                                DADE
                    Pool on the roof must have a leak.

        Kate gives Dade a look that could kill and skulks away.

        Dade walks away under his umbrella, smug and dry.

                                PHREAK
                    Man, oh man, this is gonna be good.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM.

        Dade, Kate, and a couple of other students are writing on
        the chalkboard. Kate finishes first.

                                KATE
                    If God gave men brains bigger than dogs',
                    they wouldn't hump womens' legs at cocktail
                    parties.

        The class giggles.

                                KATE
                    Ruth Libby.

                                TEACHER
                    I'm not so sure your mother qualifies as a
                    significant author of the twentieth century.

                                KATE
                    Her last book sold two million copies.

                                CLASS
                                (almost in unison)
                    Woooooo!

        The teacher reads Dade's quotation.

                                TEACHER
                    "Angel-headed hipsters burning for the ancient
                    heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in
                    the machinery of the night."

                                DADE
                    That's Ginsburg.

                                TEACHER
                    Nice. Very nice.

                                KATE
                    He's not in this class.

                                DADE
                    I said give me time.

                                KATE
                    He's not enrolled in this class.

                                TEACHER
                    Well, he's on my list.

        Kate leaps across a desk and snatches the list from the
        teacher. Dade is on it. She gives Dade another filthy
        look, both Dade and the teacher just shrug. The teacher
        moves on to Cereal.

                                TEACHER
                    "Of all the things I've lost, I miss my mind
                    the most?"

                                CEREAL
                    Ozzy Osbourne!

                                TEACHER
                    You. What is your name?

        The teacher grabs the list back from Kate.

                                CEREAL
                    Uh, Emmanuel Goldstein, sir?

                                TEACHER
                    You, however, are not on my list.

                                CEREAL
                                (in mock shock)
                    Whoa, this isn't wood shop class?

        The class cracks up. Kate and Dade exchange looks as the
        teacher escorts Cereal to the door.

INT. DADE'S PLACE.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    How was school?

                                DADE
                                (eating)
                    Hmmm.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    What did we learn in school today?

                                DADE
                    Revenge.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?

                                DADE
                    No. No one special.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    Okay, I gotta get back to work. I'm gonna be
                    home late.  And would you try and please fill
                    these out?

        She indicates a pile of college applications.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    Oh don't worry, it's only the rest of your
                    life.

        She starts to the door.

                                DADE
                    Right. Anything else, you want me to mow the
                    lawn? Oops, forgot. New York. No grass.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    And unpack.

        She leaves. Dade looks over the college applications for
        a second, and pushes them away. He'd rather not do this
        now.

INT. CYBERDELIA.

        Dade, Phreak and Joey are sitting at a table. Joey is
        giving a dull account of his hacking adventures. Enter
        Cereal.

                                CEREAL
                    FYI, alright man, you can sit at home, and do
                    like absolutely nothing and...

        Cereal pauses, notices Dade, whom he has never met
        formally but seen around, and then continues.

                                CEREAL
                    ...and your name goes through like seventeen

                    Anyways, guys, guys, listen, listen to me.
                    I'm in this computer right? So I'm looking
                    around...

                                CEREAL
                    Oh yeah, technicolor rainbow.

         Cereal brings a book out of his bag.

                                CEREAL
                    Green one.

                                JOEY
                    What is that, what is that? Lemmie see. What
                    are these?

        Cereal pulls out another book.

                                CEREAL

        Cereal hands the orange book to Phreak.

                    Computer security criteria, DOD standards.

        Another book comes out.

                                DADE
                    The Pink Shirt Book, Guide to IBM PCs. So
                    called due to the nasty pink shirt the guy
                    wears on the cover.

        Another one.

                    won't fit on a shelf.

        By now Phreak has made a pile of the books, and the Red
        Book looks wholly out of place on the top of the pile.

                                JOEY
                    Anyway, anyway, guys guys guys, come on. I'm
                    in this computer, right. So I'm looking
                    around, looking around, you know, throwing
                    commands at it, I don't know where it is or
                    what it does or anything. It's like, it's
                    like choice, it's just beautiful, okay. Like
                    four hours I'm just messing around in there.
                    Finally I figure out, that it's a bank.
                    Right, okay wait, okay, so it's a bank. So, this
                    morning, I look in the paper, some cash
                    machine in like Bumsville Idaho, spits out
                    seven hundred dollars into the middle of the
                    street.

                                CEREAL
                    That's kinda cool.

                                JOEY
                    That was me. That was me. I did that.

                                DADE
                    You did this from your house.

        Joey takes a drag from his cigarette and just nods, with a
        big grin on his face.

                                PHREAK
                    What are you, stoned or stupid? You don't
                    hack a bank across state lines from your
                    house, you'll get nailed by the FBI. Where
                    are your brains, in your ass? Don't you know
                    anything?

                                CEREAL
                    Stupid, man. It's universally stupid.

                                JOEY
                    You guys always think I should know
                    everything, and you never tell me anything.
                    Am I right?

                                PHREAK
                    Alright, what are the three most commonly used
                    passwords?

                                JOEY
                    Love, secret, and uh, sex.  But not in that
                    order, necessarily, right?

                                CEREAL
                    Yeah but don't forget God. System operators
                    love to use God. It's that whole male ego
                    thing.

                                PHREAK
                    Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a
                    righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.

                                CEREAL
                    Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack,
                    you score one of those Gibsons man. You know,
                    supercomputers they use to like, do physics,
                    and look for oil and stuff?

                                PHREAK
                    Ain't no way, man, security's too tight. The
                    big iron?

                                DADE
                    Maybe. But, if I were gonna hack some heavy
                    metal, I'd, uh, work my way back through some
                    low security, and try the back door.

                                CEREAL
                    Yeah but oh man,
                                (starts rubbing one of his

                    wouldn't you just love to get one of those
                    Gibsons, baby? Ooooh!

                                PHREAK
                    Yo, who ate all of my fries?

        Cereal pauses a second.

                                CEREAL
                                (pretending to be enraged)
                    Joey?!

                                JOEY
                    What, no, nonononono, I didn't touch your
                    fries. I did not touch your fries.

                                PHREAK
                    Cereal, man, you owe me a pack.

                                CEREAL
                    It was him, man!

                                PHREAK
                    You're psyched. You need to lay off of that
                    shit.

                                CEREAL
                                (to Joey)
                    I'm gonna hit you!

INT. JOEY'S ROOM. NIGHT.

        Joey is hacking. A Gibson. He gets in. Using GOD as a
        password. Nice graphics represent the machine's vast
        systems.

                                JOEY
                    YES! Home run, home run. You and me Lucy.
                    We're gonna show em baby.

INT. COMPUTER ROOM, ELLINGSON MINERAL.

        A system operator at Ellingson Mineral Corporation, a
        large oil company, notices the intrusion. He gets on the
        phone.

INT. PLAGUE'S LOFT.

        The place is a mess, typical of the hacker bachelor pad.
        Empty chinese food boxes and Jolt Cola cans litter the
        place.

        Plague's phone is ringing, waking him.

                                HAL
                                (on phone)
                    Mr. Belford?

                                PLAGUE
                                (sleepily)
                    My name is the Plague.

                                HAL
                    Uh, Mr. The Plague, uh, something weird's
                    happening on the net.

                                PLAGUE
                    As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?

                                HAL
                    Uh, the accounting subdirectory in the Gibson
                    is working really hard. We got one person
                    online, the workload is enough for like ten
                    users. I think we've got a hacker.

INT. JOEY'S ROOM.

                                JOEY
                    Okay, okay, we need proof that we were here.
                    Right, uh...

        Joey starts looking for something to download as proof he
        was there.

                                JOEY
                    Yeah, Garbage, okay, give me Garbage.

        He selects a Garbage file and starts the download. His
        screen becomes a psychedelic mind trip.

INT. COMPUTER ROOM, ELLINGSON MINERAL.

        The Plague glides in on a skateboard. Short and thin,
        bearded, about 35 but still trying to be a teenage
        anarchist, yet not consciously realizing he sold out that
        ideal years ago.

                                PLAGUE
                    Never fear. I is here.

                                HAL
                    I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.

                                PLAGUE
                    Let's echo 23, see what's up.

        The huge monitor lights up with the display of the
        Gibson's resources. Hal and the Plague watch. Plague
        starts "surfing" around.

                                PLAGUE
                    "God" wouldn't be up this late.

        He sees what Joey is downloading. A file called
        "Garbage".

                                PLAGUE
                    Shit! Get me the switching control center.

        He puts on a telephone headset. Hal dials for him.

                                PLAGUE
                                (into the headset)
                    I need to trace a call that's in progress.

INT. JOEY'S ROOM.

        Joey is sneaking a cigarette while his computer downloads.
        There is a knock at the door. It's his mother.

                                JOEY
                                (whispering)
                    Shit!
                                (loudly, panicked)
                    Uh yeah... hold on, mom. Hold on one second.

        He puts out the cigarette and sprays the room with air
        freshener.

                                JOEY'S MOM
                    I mean it! Open the door, Joseph.

                                JOEY
                    Yeah, uh, yeah, okay.

        He unlocks the door. Joey's mom bursts in. He's still
        clambering into bed.

                                JOEY
                    There you go.

                                JOEY'S MOM
                    Bed. Sleep. Now!

        She turns off the computer. It wasn't finished
        downloading.

                                JOEY'S MOM
                    Sweet dreams, Joey.

                    Good.

INT. JOEY'S ROOM. DARK.

        Joey takes a disk out of his computer and stashes it in an
        air vent in the cieling.

INT. TENEMENT HALLWAY.

        Phreak, Dade and Cereal are rollerblading through the
        halls of an apartment building that is filled with
        graffiti. It appears that most of the spray-bomb art was
        created by the residents.

                                CEREAL
                    Nice place, huh.

        Cereal knocks on a door spray-painted "Hackstock"

                                DADE
                    You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn? You
                    know who he is?

                                PHREAK
                                (surprised)
                    No, don't know who he is.
                                (to Cereal)
                    Do you?

        Cereal shrugs.

        A hooded black man in his early twenties answers the door.

                                PHREAK
                    Nikon! Lord Nikon this is...

        Phreak motions to Dade.

                                DADE
                                (finishing)
                    Crash Override.

                                NIKON
                    Never heard of you. Done anything?

                                DADE
                    No.

        Nikon slams the door.

                                PHREAK
                    Come on!

        Phreak knocks the door again. Nikon opens again.

                                NIKON
                    What, your mom buy you a 'Puter for Christmas?
                                (to Phreak)
                    Does he know anything?

                                PHREAK
                    Sure man, he's elite.

                                NIKON
                                (pausing, checking Dade out)
                    Come in.

                                CEREAL
                    Uh... Nikon, can I... can I crash at your
                    place tonight?

                                NIKON
                                (removing his hood)
                    Again?
                                (pauses, then grins broadly)

INT. JOEY'S PLACE.

        Joey is taking a shower, wearing walkman headphones,
        singing along with the music. Joey finishes, turns off
        the shower, still singing. He draws open the shower
        curtain to find two secret service agents with shotguns
        pointed at him.

                                SS AGENT

                    What? What? What did I do? What?

        The agents drag Joey, still naked and wet, out of the
        shower and into the living room. His mother is
        hysterical..

                    Stay down there. Don't move.

        Joey is pushed into a sofa. He sees his computer, "Lucy",
        being carried away.

                                JOEY
                    Lucy!

        Joey dives onto the agent carrying Lucy away, losing his
        towel.  His mother, seeing his exposed buttocks, is
        shocked.

                    JOEY!!!

EXT. OUTSIDE JOEY'S PLACE.

        A police-type vehicle pulls up. It's Agent Richard Gill
        of the Secret Service.  He stops a young agent for an
        update.

                                GILL
                    How's it going, Ray?

                                AGENT RAY
                    It looks good, sir. We've got an uncorrupted
                    hard drive.

                                GILL
                    In English, please. I didn't spend ten years
                    protecting the president so I could finish my
                    career feeling like an idiot.

                                AGENT RAY
                    I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so
                    we don't think he had time to erase his
                    computer files.

                                GILL
                    Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up
                    here, and take him in for interrogation.

                                AGENT RAY
                    Alright sir.

        They split up.  A reporter and her sound man run up to
        Gill.

                                REPORTER
                    Agent Gill, can you spare a moment of your
                    time?

                                GILL
                    Why of course, Jennifer.

        While Jennifer conducts the interview, agents lead Joey
        into an unmarked car. His mother is behind him, still
        hysterical.

                    public and privately owned computer systems,
                    infecting them with viruses...

INT. ELLINGSON BOARDROOM.

        A handsome looking woman in her late thirties walks in.

                    Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I
                    see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.

                    Once again, don't call me Eugene.
                                (to the board)
                    A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a
                    superuser acount, giving him access to our
                    whole system.

                                MARGO
                    Precisely what you're paid to prevent.

                    Someone didn't bother reading my carefully
                    prepared memo on commonly used passwords.
                    Now, as I so meticulously pointed out, the for
                    most used passwords are love,

                    ...God. So would your holiness care to change
                    her password?

        Margo just blinks prettily.

                    Virus?

                                PLAGUE
                    Yesterday, the ballast program for a
                    supertanker training model mistakenly thought
                    the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.

                                MARGO
                    Excuse me?

                                PLAGUE
                                (as if to a child)
                    The little boat flipped over. A virus planted
                    in the Gibson computer system claimed
                    responsibility.

                                MARGO
                    What, it left a note?

        Plague hits a button on a remote control, and the virus -
        a long haired male model - appears on a large screen, in
        psychedelic colors. The virus speaks in a hammy Italian
        accent.

                                VIRUS
                    Unless five million dollars are transferred to
                    the following numbered account in seven days,
                    I will capsize five tankers in the Ellingson
                    fleet.

                                (interrupting)
                    That is the virus. Leonardo da Vinci. The
                    problem is we have twenty six ships at sea and
                    we don't know which ones are infected.

                                DUKE ELLINGSON
                    Well then, put the ships' ballasts under
                    manual control.

                                PLAGUE
                    There's no such thing anymore, Duke. These
                    ships are totally computerized. They rely on
                    satellite navigation, which links them to our
                    network, and the virus, wherever they are in
                    the world.

                                MARGO
                    So what are we supposed to do?

                                PLAGUE
                    Well luckily, you have a gifted and talented
                    security officer. I traced the hacker's call.
                    The secret service picked him up this morning.
                    I'll just search his files for the original
                    virus code, and then I can eliminate it.

                    Yeah, the Secret Service is helping us out 100

                    I created Mister da Vinci so we could call in

                                PLAGUE
                    I can cancel it any time. I don't need any
                    program code. But it's the perfect cover, to
                    confiscate the disc and find out how much of
                    that garbage file has been copied.

                                MARGO
                    Get it!
                                (walking away)
                    Why did I ever trust you?
                                (going back up the escalator)
                    Get the file. Otherwise you'll lose all your
                    toys.

INT. SECRET SERVICE INTERROGATION ROOM.

        Joey is distraught over the dismantling of Lucy. Agent
        Ray examines the Mac's innards.

                                GILL
                    Did you find the program for the virus on any
                    of the discs we confiscated?

                                PLAGUE
                    No. He's either very smart or very stupid.

                                GILL
                    Then he stashed it somewhere, or he has an
                    accomplice. We'll release him until his
                    indictment, keep tight surveillance, and see
                    if he leads us to your disc.

EXT. OUTSIDE JOEY'S PLACE.

        Joey's apartment building is an L-shaped skyscraper about
        30 storeys high, unimpressive by New York City standards.
        Two Secret Service agents are staking Joey out in a car
        outside.

                                SECRET SERVICE AGENT BOB
                    Unit 3 outside suspect Joey Pardella's
                    apartment. Nothing to report. Suspect still
                    grounded... by his mother.

        His radio crackles.

                                AGENT BOB
                    Listen to this bullshit.
                                (he reads)
                    "This is our world now. The world of the
                    electron and the switch, the beauty of the
                    baud. We exist without nationality, skin
                    color, or religious bias. You wage wars,
                    murder, cheat, lie to us and try to make us
                    believe it's for our own good, yet we're the
                    criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is
                    that of curiosity. I am a hacker and this is
                    my manifesto." Huh, right, manifesto? "You
                    may stop me, but you can't stop us all."

                                AGENT RAY
                    Now that's cool.

                                AGENT BOB
                    Cool?

                                AGENT RAY
                    Yeah, cool.

                                AGENT BOB
                    You think it's cool?

                                AGENT RAY
                                (not caring for where Bob is going
                                with this)
                    It's cool!

                                AGENT BOB
                    It's not cool. It's commie bullshit!

INT. HIGH SCHOOL BOYS' ROOM.

        Dade, Cereal and Phreak check their faces. Cereal brushes
        his teeth.

                                CEREAL
                                (to Phreak)
                    So what do you think, can I crash at your
                    place tonight?

                                DADE
                    What is it with this guy?

                                PHREAK
                    His parents missed Woodstock and he's been
                    making up for it since. Hey, you hear about
                    Joey's bust?

                                CEREAL
                    Yeah. Probably had something to do with that
                    bank in Idaho.

                                PHREAK
                    Do you think he could hack a Gibson?

                                DADE
                    Did you talk to him?

                                PHREAK
                    Nope. His mom said he's grounded for his next
                    three lifetimes.
                                (imitating her)
                    He isn't to consort with his computer friends.
                                (himself again)
                    The secret service is really out to get him.
                                (changes the subject)
                    Hey there's a big party tonight, you wanna go?

        Dade shakes his head.

                                PHREAK
                    It's at Kate's...

        Dade just smiles.

                                PHREAK
                     Thought so!

        Cereal and Phreak leave, Cereal dancing.

INT. PLAGUE'S OFFICE.

        Plague is wearing a VR helmet and gloves, playing some
        sort of action game. He is unaware that Gill has just
        entered the room.

                                GILL
                    What the hell are you doing? Plague!

        He thumps the VR pedestal.

                                GILL
                    PLAGUE!

        Plague finally notices, and takes off the helmet.

                                PLAGUE
                    Gill.

                                GILL
                    I think we've got something.

        Gill hands Plague a folder. It has the logo of Stanton High.

                                PLAGUE
                    Uuugh, hard copy.

        Plague looks it over and recognizes a name.

                                PLAGUE
                    Dade Murphy.

INT. DADE'S PLACE.

        It's after school. Dade's just unlocking the front door,
        only to find a Secret Service agent behind it.  And one
        behind him in the hallway. Both point pistols at him.

                                AGENT RAY
                    Secret Service!

                                AGENT BOB
                    Don't move!

        They slam Dade against a wall and start frisking him.

                                DADE
                    Christ! What is the...

                                AGENT BOB
                    Shut up!

                                DADE
                    What are you doing, man? Get off me!

        They lead him into his room and throw him down on the bed.
        Plague is there.

                                AGENT BOB
        Just sit in the bed and keep your hands where we can see
        them.

                                PLAGUE
                    The year was 1988.  And this nasty virus
                    crashed fifteen hundred systems in one day.

        Dade has a flashback.

                                DADE
                    Fifteen hundred and seven.

                                AGENT RAY
                                (astounded)
                    Wow, huh!

                                GILL
                    It got you seven years probation. No
                    computer, couldn't even use a touch tone
                    phone.

                                PLAGUE
                    Must have been hell, huh? Zero Cool?
                                (getting to the point)
                    A virus has been planted in the Ellingson
                    Mineral computer system. You were our prime
                    suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found
                    no trace of it.

                                GILL
                    However, we have come to believe that one Joey
                    Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus.
                    He or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that
                    Mr. Belford needs to disable that virus. We
                    want you to help us find it.

                                PLAGUE
                    Gill.

        The three secret service agents leave Plague and Dade
        alone.  Plague shuts the door behind them.

                                PLAGUE
                                (of Gill)
                    Loser.
                                (continues)
                    I can't believe you were only eleven when you
                    wrote this. It's quite an impressive virus.
                    Dade, I know how you might feel about narking
                    on your friends, but, we're hackers. For us,
                    there's no such thing as family and friends.
                    We're each our own country, with temporary
                    allies and enemies. I'd like to make a treaty
                    with you.

                                DADE
                    I'm sorry. Who are you?

                                PLAGUE
                    I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we
                    be allies?

                                DADE
                    Nah. I don't play well with others.

        Plague is holding Dade's baseball bat. He shrugs, turns
        around, and smashes Dade's stereo to smithereens.

                                DADE
                    Shit! Come on!

                                PLAGUE
                    Watch which friends you do play with. A
                    record like yours could land you in jail, get
                    you kicked out of school, no colleges would
                    take you. No future. Exiled from everyone and
                    everything you love.

        Plague replaces the baseball bat.

                                PLAGUE
                    I'll be in touch.

        Plague leaves.

                    I'm fine.
                                (to Dade)
                    Oh, and Dade, try to stay out of trouble, okay?

                                DADE
                    Blow me.

                    Thank you!

INT. DADE'S ROOM. LATER.

        Dade is lying in bed. A door opens. It's Kate. She opens
        her motorcycle jacket, revealing her bare breasts. Dade
        starts to get up, she pushes him back own on the bed and
        starts kissing him passionately. He responds in kind.
        Then, Gill, Agent Ray and Agent Bob burst into the room,
        handcuff him, break the two up and haul them away as
        Plague looks on smugly.

        Then Dade wakes up in a sweat.  It was only a dream. He
        regains his composure.  The sound of New York City at
        night surrounds him. He goes back to sleep.

INT. KATE'S PLACE.

        The party. A large, well-furnished apartment in an
        elegant old skyscraper in the fashionable part of town.
        Teenagers dance and writhe to loud, bassy music. Dade and
        Phreak arrive.

                                PHREAK
                    Her mom makes big bucks writing self-help
                    books for women. Stuff like "Women Who Love
                    Men Who Are Emotional Amoebae"

        Phreak shows Dade the book.

                                DADE
                    That explains a lot.

        Kate, the lovely and gracious hostess, mingles and greets
        her many guests, not noticing Dade or Phreak. Cereal
        offers Dade a drink from a plastic bottle. Dade, not
        knowing what he's in for, drinks. Nikon is the Deejay.

                                PHREAK
                                (loudly)

                                NIKON
                    Yo Phreak! Dade, man, you made it.
                                (to Cereal)
                    Houston, we have liftoff, 3 o'clock,
                    check it... don't look right away, what's
                    wrong with you! Look at her man...

        Nikon and Cereal are checking out a truly fine babe.

                                NIKON
                                (concentrating)
                    Look out, man. Lisa Blair, 26 East 7th St.,
                    apartment 16, 555-4817, BOOM!

                                DADE
                    How did you know that?

                                NIKON
                    I got photographic memory.
                                (Smiling)
                    It's a curse!
                                (Into the crowd)
                    Lisa!

                                LISA
                    Hey, how do you know my name?

        Cereal and Phreak move through the crowd. Cereal notices
        something.

                                CEREAL
                    Oooo, look at that pooper man. Spandex, it's
                    a privilege, not a right!

INT. MEETING HALL.

        A 12-step recovery group. Addicts, including Joey
        Pardella, sit in a semi-circle.

                                VICKIE
                    Hi, my name is Vickie, and I'm an addict.

                    Hi, my name is Hank, and uh, I'm an addict.

                                JOEY
                                (smoking)
                    Uh, my name's Joey but, uh, I'm not an addict.

        Joey takes a drag. The group reacts indignantly.

                                JOEY
                    Nono, really, really, listen, listen to this.
                    I got in trouble with my computer, right,
                    okay, and my lawyer told the judge that I'm an
                    addict, but I'm not addicted to my computer!
                    No really, really,

        Joey takes another drag.

                                JOEY
                    I'm not an addict. I'm not, I'm not.

        Joey downs his coffee.

                                JOEY
                    Can I get some more coffee?

INT. KATE'S BEDROOM.

        Phreak is checking out Kate's computer.

                                PHREAK
                    Yo. Check this out guys, this is insanely
                    great, it's got a 28.8 BPS modem!

                                DADE
                    Yeah? Display?

                    Active matrix, man. A million psychedelic
                    colors. Man, baby, sweet, ooo!

                    I want it to have my children!

                                CEREAL
                    Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.

                                PHREAK
                    Yo, hit the lights.

                    Dade hits the lights. The four ooo and ahh at
                    its graphics. Kate and Curtis walk into the
                    room and hit the bed, unaware of the hackers
                    in the corner by her laptop.

                                DADE
                                (whispering)
                    Shit!

                    Shh!

                                DADE
                    Was that her top?

                                PHREAK
                    One-handed!

                                NIKON
                    Seven. Wow! Burn's wetware matches her
                    software!

                                DADE
                                (loudly)
                    Burn!

        Their cover is blown.

                                NIKON
                    What the f...

        Cereal hides under the desk.

                                KATE
                    Hey! What are you guys doing in here?

                                PHREAK
                    I'm sorry, we're sorry, just checking out your
                    fly laptop!

                                NIKON
                    Yeah, it's hyped, you know... you're in the
                    butter zone now, baby.

                                PHREAK
                                (smiling)
                    Uh-huh!

                                KATE
                                (her tone changing)
                    Yeah, it is...
                                (she comes over to it)
                    I wanna triple the RAM...

                                CURTIS
                    Oooh, Leopard Boy... AND the Decepticons. Uh,
                    Kate, Kate, you're not going into that
                    computer shit now, right?

        Kate barely acknowledges him.

                                CURTIS
                                (cynically)
                    Humm, yeah.

        Curtis leaves.

                                CEREAL
                                (mockingly)
                    Right.

                                DADE
                    The sensitive type.

        Kate finally notices that Dade, whom she didn't invite, is at her
        party and in her bedroom.

                                KATE
                    What is he doing in here?

                                PHREAK
                    Relax, Burn, he's my guest.

                                DADE
                    Burn. You're Acid Burn. You booted me out of
                    OTV!

                                KATE
                    What?

                                DADE
                    I'm Crash Override.

                                KATE
                    You're the moron that's been invading my turf?

                                CEREAL
                    Whoa, whowhowhowhoa.
                                (motioning to Dade)
                    Crash...
                                (motioning to Kate)
                    and Burn!

        Cereal breaks into hysterics.

INT. PLAGUE'S LOFT.

        Plague is hacking.

                                MARGO
                    Murphy kid turn you down?

                                PLAGUE
                                (in a hammy southern accent)
                    I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper
                    and penetrated the FBI NCIC.

                                MARGO
                    Pervert! What are you talking about?

        She turns her back to him. He does up the zipper on her
        dress. Their relationship becomes apparent.

                                PLAGUE
                    The FBI computer holds files on twenty million
                    Americans.  I just hacked into it.

                                MARGO
                    Congratulations.

                                PLAGUE
                    From here I got access to every piece of data
                    ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His
                    parents separated five years ago, reconciled
                    two years later, filed for divorce last year,
                    custody battle, boy chose to go with his
                    mother. Hmm.

                                MARGO
                    So?

                                PLAGUE
                    So, we get the mother, we get the boy.

INT. KATE'S ROOM.

        Kate's room is empty, and Dade can't resist going back in
        to play with her laptop, which far outclasses his own,
        some more. On the balcony, Kate notices and comes back
        in.

                                KATE
                    What the hell are you doing?

                                DADE
                    It's cool, I'm just looking.

                                KATE
                    It's too much machine for you.

                                DADE
                    Yeah?

        Dade starts working furiously on it.

                                KATE
                    I hope you don't screw like you type.

        Dade slows to a two-finger keypoke, not missing a beat.

                                DADE
                    It has a killer refresh rate.

                                KATE
                    P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.

                                DADE
                    Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI
                    bus. But you knew that.

                                KATE
                    Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change
                    everything.

                                DADE
                    Yeah. RISC is good.

        They uncomfortably exchange glances.

                                DADE
                    You sure this sweet machine's not going to
                    waste?

                                KATE
                    Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the
                    Best, Die Like the Rest?"

                                DADE
                    Yeah.

                                KATE
                    Are you challenging me?

                                DADE
                    Name your stakes.

                                KATE
                    If I win, you become my slave.

                                DADE
                                (intrigued)
                    Your slave?

                                KATE
                                (realizing his mind is in the
                                gutter)
                    You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack
                    copyrights, whatever I want.

                                DADE
                    And if I win?

                                KATE
                                (giggles)
                    Make it my first born.

                                DADE
                    Make it our first date.

                                KATE
                    You're not gonna win.

                                DADE
                    And you have to smile.

                                KATE
                    I don't do dates. But I don't lose either, so
                    you're on.

MONTAGE: Scenes of Dade and Kate preparing for the challenge.

                                PHREAK
                                (voice over)
                    So here's the deal. The chosen contest: To
                    hassle Secret Service Agent Richard Gill, and
                    get one back for Joey.

        Dade spray paints camouflage onto his keyboard.

                                NIKON
                    Our decisions are final, by a vote of 2 to 1.
                    No appeals.

        Kate rifles through her address book.

                                CEREAL
                    The duel will last until we declare a winner.

        Dade plays quick-draw with disks.

                    Use only the dialups, access codes and
                    passwords in your collection. Can't ask for
                    any help from us.

        Dade, having mastered the quick-disk-draw in the mirror,
        looks satisfied.

                                DADE
                                (into mirror)
                    Talking to me?

        All five are together at the beginning of the challenge.

                                PHREAK
                    Any questions?

                                KATE
                    Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin?

        Dade and Kate shake hands and the challenge begins.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY PUBLIC PHONE.

        At a public phone, Kate hacks into Concourse Bank, looks
        up Richard Gill, and has his credit card maxed out.
        "Destroy Card" is the final instruction. The other
        hackers look on.

INT. RESTAURANT.

        A waiter runs a credit card through a validation machine,
        sees the message and returns to the patron's table. It is
        Richard Gill. Right there, the waiter chops the
        MasterCard in two with a pair of scissors, to Gill's
        horror.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY PUBLIC PHONE.

        Dade hacks into an electronic personal ads system and
        changes an ad.

                                KATE
                    Alright, he's in the personal ads.
                                (reading Dade's ad)
                    "Disappointed white male, crossdresser, looking
                    for discreet friend to bring dreams to
                    reality. Leather, lace, and water sports.
                    Transvestites welcome."

INT. GILL'S OFFICE.

        At his office, Gill is on the speaker phone with someone
        responding to the ad.

                                GILL
                    I... I... I know where you can stick it... I
                    know where you can stick it...

        Gill punches a button on the phone, another caller comes
        on.

                                CALLER
                    ...wanna lick your earlobes... I wanna lick
                    your lips... I wanna lick your toes... I
                    wanna lick your ankles...

                                GILL
                    Awww, yeah, you wanna lick something? Lick this.

        Gill punches another button, another caller comes on.

                                CALLER
                    That's why they call me Stallion...

                                GILL
                    Aw, that's disgusting!

        Gill punches another button.

                                CALLER
                    My heart is steaming for you...

        Gill punches another button. He is becoming quite flustered.

                                CALLER
                    ...spank you with my...

                                GILL
                    Aww, Spank your ass...

        He punches another button.

        Another caller comes on, and Gill hangs up the phone,
        disgusted, offended, and distraught. The Plague is there,
        witnessing the whole thing.

                                PLAGUE
                    Animal!

EXT. EMPIRE STATE BULDING OBSERVATION DECK.

        It's Kate's turn. Kate is hacking into the Department of
        Motor Vehicles. She adds 113 traffic violations and DUI
        offender status to Gill's record.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY, BUSY STREET.

        Gill is being arrested quite forcefully by a NYC police
        grunt.  He is thrown onto the hood of his car and
        handcuffed.

                                GILL
                     Hey! Hey, ow! Do you know who I am? Do you
                     know who I am?

EXT. CHINATOWN, PUBLIC PHONE.

        Dade's turn. He hacks into the Secret Service's personnel
        file, and changes Gill's status to "Deceased."

INT. GILL'S OFFICE.

                                EMPLOYEE
                                (on phone)
                    This is accounting, sir. You enquired about
                    an employee of ours, an Agent Richard Gill?

                                GILL
                    Yes.

                                EMPLOYEE
                    Our records indicate he's deceased.

                                GILL
                    I'm what?

INT. CYBERDELIA.

        The five are playing pool.

                                DADE
                    Dead.

                                PHREAK
                    Dead?

                                DADE
                    Yeah. Like Rigor Mortis, Habeas Corpus.

                                NIKON
                    Very impressive.

                                CEREAL
                    Super hero like even.

                                KATE
                    Yeah, whatever. What's the score?

        Phreak clicks the pool scoreboard so it says 60 - 60.

                                PHREAK
                    Tie.

        The other four protest.

                                PHREAK
                    Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and
                    everything, I guess you two will have to
                    improvise the next round.

                                DADE
                    Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our
                    date.

                                KATE
                    And if I win, so do you.

        Dade thinks about it a second.

                                DADE
                    Deal.

        Kate gives Dade a look that says "I'm going to hold you to
        that."

INT. KATE'S BED. NIGHT.

        A shapely figure wearing a red leather legless suit with a
        zipper that goes all the way around the crotch. Hands
        caress the sultry figure as the camera pans up. The body
        belongs to Dade Murphy.

        Kate wakes up gasping.  It was only a dream. She pants
        and regains her breath. Then she smiles. She enjoyed
        that dream.

                                KATE
                    Oooohhhh...

INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY.

                    Kate, at her locker, stops Dade.

                                KATE
                    Dade. I didn't know your size, so I guessed.

        She opens her locker to reveal a red leather bustier and
        bikini bottom.

                                KATE
                    You are man enough to stick with the deal,
                    aren't you?

        Dade walks off.

INT. DADE'S PLACE.

        Dade signs an electronic pad for a package from UPS. He
        takes the package.

                                DADE
                    Thanks.

        He closes the door and opens the package. It is a laptop
        computer, clear plastic shell, full colour screen. Very
        high-end, perhaps the equal to Kate's machine. He turns
        it on. The Plague's face, distorted, appears. It speaks.

                                PLAGUE
                    You wanted to know who I am, Zero Cool? Well
                    let me explain the New World Order.
                    Governments and corporations need people like
                    you and me. We are samurai. The keyboard
                    cowboys. And all those other people out there
                    who have no idea what's going on are the
                    cattle. Mooo! I need your help, you need my
                    help. Let me help you earn your spurs. Ahh,
                    think about it. Enjoy the laptop, "Cool"!
                    Tell me where the disk is.

        Plague's face vanishes.

INT. JOEY'S ROOM.

        Joey lies on his bed with a comic book, looking
        despondent. His mother enters.

                                JOEY'S MOM
                    You look pitiful. Okay, okay, you're not
                    grounded anymore.

        She kisses his forehead and leaves. He springs back to
        life, gets up and gets the disc from where he stashed it
        in the air vent.

EXT. PARK.

        Joey is nervously waiting on a park bench. Phreak arrives.
        Agents Ray and Bob still have Joey staked out.

                                PHREAK
                    Yo, what's up?

                                JOEY
                    Dude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute,
                    listen listen listen. I copied a garbage file
                    from...

                                PHREAK
                    Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it,
                    Joey, come on.

                                JOEY
                    Nono, it's like hot or something. I don't know.

                                PHREAK
                    Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data.
                    Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man.

                                JOEY
                    I copied it from Ellingson, okay? They're
                    asking me about it, alright? Will you take a
                    look for me?

        Joey hands Phreak the disc. Agent Bob is taking pictures,
        and Phreak notices.

                                PHREAK
                    Oh shit, Joey, you've got a tail.

        Joey sees, and runs for it.

                                JOEY
                    Shit!

        The agents split up, one runs after Joey, the other after
        Phreak.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL BOYS' ROOM.

        Phreak has lost his tail. He puts Joey's disc behind a
        condom machine in the boys' room at school, and sticks it
        there with gum.

INT. PHREAK'S ROOM.

        Phreak frantically destroys all records of his hacking
        career. He knows he's about to be busted.

DREAM SEQUENCE.

        The Secret Service is about to burst in on Phreak. He
        still hasn't destroyed any records, and starts manically
        going through everything. Gill is on his laptop screen.

                                GILL
                    I'm watching you...

INT. PHREAK'S ROOM. MORNING.

        A knock on the door. Phreak awakes. It's his mother.

                                PHREAK'S MOM
                    Ramon? Wake up. Ramon! Wake up! Vamano.
                    Time for school, come on.

        The secret service bursts in through the window just as
        Phreak's mom opens the blind. She screams, Phreak leaps
        to his feet.

                                AGENT
                    Secret Service, don't move!

                                PHREAK
                    Deja vu!

                                AGENT BOB
                    Ray Sanchez, you are under arrest, under the
                    Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.

        Phreak's mom becomes very angry and starts slapping
        Phreak, cursing in Spanish.

                                PHREAK
                    What are you waiting for, arrest me already!

INT. POLICE STATION LOCKUP.

        The undersized Phreak is just a morsel to the hardened
        thugs behind these bars and they taunt him viciously as he
        is led to his one phone call.

                                COP
                    You get one call. Uno. Understand?

        The cop locks the dial on the phone.

        Phreak waits for the cop to leave, and hangs up. He
        starts rapidly pushing the hangup hook, and he hears a
        ringing tone.

                                OPERATOR
                    Hello, operator services.

                                PHREAK
                    Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a
                    number.

                                OPERATOR
                    What number please?

                                PHREAK
                    555-4202.

                                OPERATOR
                    Just one moment.

                                PHREAK
                    Thank you.

        Kate answers.

                                KATE
                    Hello?

                                PHREAK
                    Hey, it's me.

                                KATE
                    Phreak?

                                PHREAK
                    I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He
                    really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the
                    disc with a file he copied and now I'm in
                    jail! They're charging me with some serious
                    shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do,
                    like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and
                    they keep asking about you guys.

                                KATE
                    You think they're going to bust us?

                                PHREAK
                    Yeah! You better figure out what's on that
                    disc, cause we're being framed. It's in that
                    place where I put that thing that time?

        He hangs up just as the cop returns.

INT. SCHOOL BOYS' ROOM.

        Kate is entirely out of place in the boys' room, as the
        boys look on amusedly.  She finds the disc behind the
        condom machine and pockets it. Then she buys a condom from
        the machine and struts out, smiling sweetly, hot as fire.

INT. DADE'S PLACE.

        Kate knocks. Mrs. Murphy lets Kate and Cereal in.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    Hi!
                                (looking Kate over)
                    Well, now I see what all the fuss is about.
                                (she shows them to Dade's room)
                    Dade... you have company.

                                CEREAL
                    It's a nice room.

                                KATE
                    We need your help.

                                DADE
                    Do my ears deceive me?

        Kate starts to leave.

                                CEREAL
                    Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got
                    a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up
                    call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand
                    free access to data, well, it comes with some
                    responsibility. When I was a child, I spake
                    as a child, I understood as a child, I thought
                    as a child, but when I became a man I put away
                    childish things.
                                (pause)
                    What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse
                    11, no duh. Come on.

                                KATE
                    Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need
                    your help to figure out what's on this disc.

                                DADE
                    I can't. Everybody who touches that thing
                    gets busted, I can't afford to get arrested,
                    I'm sorry.

                                CEREAL
                    Maybe I should just go to the bathroom or
                    something.

        Cereal leaves the room.

                                KATE
                    What is it with you? I know we've been
                    playing games, but, we're supposed to be on
                    the same side and we really need your help. I
                    really need your help.

                                DADE
                    I'm sorry, I can't.

                                KATE
                    Well, could you just make a copy of the disc?
                    And just hide it in case we get busted, so we
                    have something to give our lawyers, something
                    that hasn't been tampered with? Can you do
                    that?

        A knock on the door. Dade's mom peeks in.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    Listen you guys, help yourself to anything in
                    the fridge. Cereal has.

        She leaves.

                                KATE
                                (to Mrs. Murphy)
                    Thank you.

                                DADE
                    Okay. I'll copy it.

                                KATE
                    Okay, thank you.

        Later.  Plague phones Dade. Plague has Lauren Murphy's
        records on his screen.

                                PLAGUE
                    The girl. The girl has the disc I need.

                                DADE
                    I told you, I don't play well with others.

                    Turn on your laptop. Set it to receive a
                    file.

        Dade does.

        An extensive criminal record with a strange woman's
        picture comes up. The strange woman transforms into
        Dade's mother.

                                PLAGUE
                    Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the
                    state of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement,
                    two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole.
                    When she's arrested, she will not have a
                    trial, she will not pass go, she will go
                    directly to jail. Then I change this file
                    back to the original, and your mom disappears.

                    What can I tell you. Computers never lie,
                    kid. Your mom will be arrested at work,
                    she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip
                    searched.

                                DADE
                    You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.

                                PLAGUE
                    Kid, don't threaten me. There are worse
                    things than death and, uh, I can do all of
                    them!

        Dade emerges from his room. His exhausted, overworked
        mother is asleep on the couch. He pulls a blanket over
        her.

EXT. PUBLIC PHONE, WET STREET, NIGHT.

        Shortly after, Dade is outside on a payphone.

                                PLAGUE
                    Talk to me.

                                DADE
                    I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's
                    on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it
                    out. She's not the one who planted the virus.
                    You leave her alone.

                                PLAGUE
                    Hey, don't worry, kid. If she's innocent,
                    she'll be fine. Your mommy's safe now, okay?

        Dade hangs up and waits for some time.  A limousine drives
        by, with a skateboarder tailing. Plague grabs the disc,
        jumps in the limo and speeds away. Dade tries to chase
        but gives up quickly.

INT. KATE'S ROOM.

        Dade shows up.  Kate, Nikon, and Cereal are working on the
        disc.

                                DADE
                    Kate, listen.

                                KATE
                    Uh, hold on...

                                DADE
                    I have to tell you something.

                                CEREAL
                    Hold on a second!

                                NIKON
                    Look at this, it's so lean and clean.

                                CEREAL
                    Looks like a hacker wrote it.

                                KATE
                    Come here, look at this. This thing is dense.

        Nikon points out part of the code.

                                NIKON
                    But that's ill, man. It's incomplete. This
                    is taking forever and a day to figure out.
                    I'm gonna make some coffee.

        Dade takes Nikon's place.

                                CEREAL
                    Tag, you're in.

        Hours pass. Dade studies and reverse engineers the
        garbage file. The other hackers watch, and do just about
        anything but be hackers. Finally, over boxes of
        half-finished pizza, Dade makes an announcement.

                                DADE
                    This isn't a virus. It's a worm!

                                NIKON
                    What's this one eat?

                                DADE
                    It nibbles. You see this?

        Dade indicates a rapidly scrolling data display.

                                DADE
                    This is every financial transaction Ellingson
                    conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to
                    the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.

                                KATE
                    The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.

                                DADE
                    And no one's caught it because the money isn't
                    really gone. It's just data being shifted
                    around.

                                KATE
                    Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out
                    with the money and erases its tracks.

                                DADE
                    Joey got cut off before he got to that part.
                    Check it out. By this point, it's already
                    running at, what, twice the speed as when it
                    started.

                                KATE
                    Right, and at this rate it ends its run in...

                                NIKON
                    Two days.

                                DADE
                    And judging by this segment alone, it's
                    already eaten about...

                                CEREAL
                    21.8 million bucks, man.

        Nikon whistles.

                                KATE
                    Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the
                    fall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and
                    that's us. We've got to get the rest of the
                    file, so we can find out where the money is
                    going before the worm disappears, so we can
                    find out WHO created it.

                                DADE
                    I know, I know who wrote it.

                                KATE
                    What?

                                DADE
                    This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a
                    copy of the disc you gave me.

                                KATE
                    You what?

                                DADE
                    I didn't know what was on it.

                                CEREAL
                                (agitated)
                    Oh man. That's universally stupid, man!

                                NIKON
                    Yo, man, you an amateur, man.

                                KATE
                    Why did he come to you?

                                DADE
                    I got a record. I was Zero Cool.

                                NIKON
                    Zero Cool? Crashed fifteen hundred and seven
                    systems in one day?

        Nikon closes his eyes and access his photographic memory.

                                NIKON
                    Biggest crash in history, front page, New
                    York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought
                    you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero
                    Cool! Oh, shit!

                                CEREAL
                    That's far out!

                                NIKON
                    This is Zero Cool, man! Whooo, haha!

                                KATE
                                (coldly)
                    Well that's great. There goes MIT.

                                DADE
                    I'll make it up to you!

                                KATE
                    How?

                                DADE
                    I'll hack the Gibson.

                                NIKON
                    They'll trace you like that
                                (snaps his fingers)
                    man, cops are gonna find you, they're
                    gonna find you with a smoking gun.

                                DADE
                    Fucked if I care, man.

                                NIKON
                    Look, even if you had the passwords, it'll
                    take you ten minutes to get in, and you've
                    still gotta find the files, man, I mean, the
                    cops will have you in... five minutes.

                                (suddenly lighter-hearted)
                    Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With

                                CEREAL
                    You're both screwed. I help, we can do it in six.

                                NIKON
                    Jesus, I gotta save all your asses. I help,
                    we can do it in five minutes, man.

                                DADE
                    Okay. Let's go shopping.

                    Woo hoo! Boom!

EXT. OUTSIDE ELLINGSON BUILDING.

        Dade and Kate cut through a chain link fence and jump into
        a dumpster at Ellingson. Kate lands on Dade.

                                DADE
                    You know, if I didn't live by a strict code of
                    honor, I might take advantage of this
                    situation.  Erotically, as it were.

        Kate fishes around in her pants, never breaking eye
        contact with Dade. She pulls out a flashlight. They
        start trashing. They get up to leave and are spotted by a
        security guard.

                                GUARD
                    Alright, hold it right there!

        Kate pulls out a flare gun and fires it at the security
        guard.  He ducks.

                                DADE
                    Shit!!

                                KATE
                    It's my subway defense system.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET.

        Nikon is staring down a manhole, Cereal is fishing through
        an adjacent phone company truck.

                                NIKON
                    He's way down there.

        Cereal emerges with a beltload of equipment and a hard hat.
        But he forgot the most important thing.

                                CEREAL
                    Ta-da!

                                NIKON
                    Yo, brain dead, the manual!

        Cereal goes back to the truck and gets a thick manual. The
        phone company technician comes up from the manhole.

                                PHONE COMPANY TECH
                    Hey!

                                CEREAL AND NIKON
                                (in unison, pointing down the street)
                    TRUCK!!!

        The phone company tech jumps back in the hole, Cereal and
        Nikon take off.

INT. SECRET SERVICE BULDING.

        A woman is seated at the desk.  Agent Gill walks by.

                                WOMAN
                    Find it?

        Cereal emerges from the desk, between her legs. His tool
        belt dangles obscenely from his crotch.

                                CEREAL
                    Phone's alright. The problem must be
                    somewhere else.

        Cereal walks away with his buttcrack seriously showing.

INT. ELLINGSON MINERAL OFFICES.

        Nikon poses as a flower delivery boy. He winds his way
        through the offices of Ellingson Mineral, "shoulder
        surfing", watching the workers entering passwords. His
        photographic memory captures everything.  The Plague walks
        past him, noticing briefly but not making the connection.

INT. PLAGUE'S LOFT.

        The Da Vinci virus' launch/cancel prompt is up.

                                MARGO
                                (pacing)
                    They had a large chunk of the garbage file?
                    How much do they know?

                                PLAGUE
                    Not everything. But enough to implicate us.

                                MARGO
                    You said the worm was untreaceable!

                                PLAGUE
                    Yeah. To civilians. But they're hackers.
                    But don't worry. All we have to do is launch
                    the Da Vinci virus, and then they'll all be
                    put away.

                                MARGO
                    Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can't do that!

                                PLAGUE
                    No one believes the guilty. Besides, by the
                    time they realize the truth, we'll be long
                    gone with all of our money.

        Margo starts to protest.

                                PLAGUE
                    Look, there is no right and wrong.  There is
                    only fun and boring. A thirty year prison
                    sentence sounds pretty dull to me.  Who do you
                    prefer serves it, us? Or them?

        Plague clicks on "Launch". The virus repeats its demand.

                                VIRUS
                    Unless five million dollars are transferred to
                    the following numbered account in seven days,
                    I will capsize five tankers in the Ellingson
                    fleet.

        As the virus speaks, a supertanker sails on a choppy sea.

INT. PLAGUE'S LOFT.

        Plague leaves a message on Gill's answering machine.

                    The virus goes off tomorrow morning at 10:30,
                    and those hackers tried to get into our system
                    again. At this point I insist you take more
                    strenuous action, or Ellingson Mineral will
                    hold the Secret Service responsible.

        Gill gets on the phone.

                                GILL
                                (grimly)

        As Gill gives the order, a mysterious device under his

        Nikon and Cereal taped Gill's orders.

                    Snoop onto them...

                                NIKON
                    ...as they snoop onto us.

        Nikon calls Kate.

                                KATE
                    Yeah, it's Kate.

                                NIKON
                    Hey, Burn. We got a little problem here.

INT. SUBWAY.

        Cereal, Nikon, Dade and Kate skate through a run down
        subway platform and get on the "A" Train. They go over
        the results of their password gathering spree.

                                KATE
                    Alright, so what have we got?

                                DADE
                    Well, we have fifty passwords, plus whatever
                    Polaroid head here got inside Ellingson.

                                NIKON
                    Well, I got a lot, alright? I don't know how
                    many but... my head hurts.

                                CEREAL
                    Yo, everyone check this out. Hey, what's the
                    Da Vinci virus?

                                DADE
                    What?

                                CEREAL
                    Check this out. It's a memo about how they're
                    gonna deal with those oil spills that happened
                    on the fourteenth.

                                KATE
                    What oil spills?

                                NIKON
                    Whoa, whoa. Yo, brain-dead, today is the
                    thirteenth.

                                CEREAL
                    Well this hasn't happened yet.

                                KATE
                    Wait a minute, the fourteenth, that's the same
                    day the worm ends its run.  I mean... Da Vinci
                    virus, didn't Phreak say that's what he was
                    being charged with? Look...
                                (quotes the memo)
                    "Infecting ballast programs of Ellingson
                    tankers" - they blame hackers!

                                NIKON
                                (angry)
                    Damn!

                                CEREAL
                    A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens.

        Kate gets ready to get off the subway.

                                NIKON
                    Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, where are you going,
                    huh?

                                KATE
                    I got an idea. We've got a few hours, right,
                    till we get arrested. So just stay low. I'm
                    gonna go get some help. I'll beep you, okay?
                                (to Dade)
                    Are you coming?

        Dade gets up.

                                CEREAL
                    May the Force be with you, man.

INT. INDUSTRIAL DANCE CLUB.

        Weird music plays, lots of weird people dance.  Razor and
        Blade are on stage, dancing in front of a huge speaker.

                                KATE
                    There they are!

                                DADE
                    Razor and Blade! They're flakes!

                                KATE
                    They're elite! Let's get 'em.

        Dade and Kate push through the crowd. The song changes to
        a fast industrial rap number, Razor and Blade leave the
        stage, and Dade starts getting moshed. He climbs on the
        stage to follow Razor and Blade. For his trouble, he is
        thrown back onto the crowd, who pass him around overhead.

        Finally the crowd lets him go.  He catches up with Kate.

                                KATE
                    I lost 'em. Where were you?

        Dade tries to explain, but is at a loss for words.

        They make their way to the entrance to Razor and Blade's
        lair. Video monitors are everywhere.

                                DADE
                    I don't like this.

        A robotic arm with a revolver swings around to point at
        Dade.

                                DADE
                    AAAAAUGH! I definitely don't like this!

                                BLADE
                                (through video intercom)
                    What do you want?

                                DADE
                    Ummm... we come in peace?

        Dade winces at his own corniness.

                                KATE
                    We need your help.  If you're up to it.

                                RAZOR
                    She's buff. Ballsy.

                                BLADE
                    Let's keep her.

                                RAZOR
                    Waste the dude.

        The gun goes off. It's only a cigarette lighter! No one
        can accuse Razor and Blade of not having a sense of humor.

INT. RAZOR AND BLADE'S PLACE.

                                KATE
                    A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills
                    at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.

                                DADE
                    It's somehow connected with the worm that's
                    stealing the money.

                                KATE
                    We need your help to overload the Gibson so we
                    can kill the Da Vinci virus and download the
                    worm program.

                                RAZOR
                    She's rabid, but cute.

                                BLADE
                    See, we're very busy. A TV network that
                    wishes to remain nameless has expressed an
                    interest in our show.

                                DADE
                                (noticing the stench of sellout)
                    Let's go, Kate.

                                RAZOR
                    Wait. Nobody said no. But you are going to
                    need more than just two media icons like us.
                    You need an army.

                                BLADE
                    That's it! An electronic army! If I were us,
                    I'd get on the internet, send out a major
                    distress signal.

                                RAZOR
                    Hackers of the World, Unite!

                                BLADE
                    How are you going to take care of the cops?

        Dade just smiles.

INT. DADE'S ROOM.

        Dade hacks into the city traffic light control system.
        Suddenly there is gridlock on the streets of New York
        City.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK.

        Nikon is playing chess against two Hassidic Jews.
        Cereal's beeper goes off. It displays the message:

                       GRAND CENTRAL
                       HACK THE PLANET

                                CEREAL
                    Yo. I'm blowing up. It's Kate, Grand
                    Central. Let's hit it!

        Nikon checkmates his opponent and the two leave.

        Dade, Cereal, Nikon, and Kate skate through the streets.
        Dade's program to freeze all the traffic lights on green,
        runs on schedule at 9:00:00 precisely. Picture New York City in
        morning rush hour, and every traffic light is green. Instant
        gridlock ensues. The four skate through the traffic easily, while
        the Secret Service, now pursuing them, is stuck. Gill punches a
        parked car in frustration. Its alarm goes off.

INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION.

        The four hackers skate into Grand Central Station and head
        to the lowest level. They meet up with Joey.

                                CEREAL
                    Hey Joey, you made it!

INT. GRAND CENTRAL PUBLIC PHONES.

        The hackers are now setting up laptops at a bank of pay
        phones.  Dade is wearing a "Pirate Eye" eyepiece.

                                KATE
                    Now listen up, use your best viruses to buy us
                    time, we have to get into Plague's file and
                    copy the worm.

        Cereal screams.

                                KATE

        Cereal takes off to fix the phones.

                                KATE
                    Joey, take his place.

                    What, me?

                                KATE
                    Take his place, man, do it. You can do it.

        Joey takes Cereal's place.

                                KATE
                    Ready?

                                DADE
                    Yeah.

                                KATE
                    Alright, let's boot up.

        The four boot up their machines. Various vanity screens
        come up on the laptops. They begin to hack. We see the
        inside of the Gibson. Viruses of all kinds begin to pour
        in. In the offices and data processing rooms, the
        Ellingson staff are in pandemonium. Happy faces with eye
        patches appear on their screens. "Sit on my interface."
        "Shit for Brains." "Arf Arf Arf!" Cookie monsters.

                                KATE
                    Yeah? You know if you would have said so in
                    the beginning, you would have saved yourself
                    a whole lot of trouble.

        They look out at the skyline. Suddenly, the lights in
        three buildings change. They spell out:

                    C         B
                     R    A    U
                      A    N    R
                       S    D    N
                        H

        Kate laughs, honestly impressed.

                                DADE
                    Beat that!

        Kate continues laughing.

                                DADE
                    You know, I've been having these really
                    weird..

                                KATE
                                (finishing his sentence)
                    Dreams?

        They kiss passionately.

          FADE IN:
          BLACK. It's everywhere. It swallows the screen. And so we stare
          into a sea of BLACK.

          NARRATOR (V.0.)
          I saw a severed head once. Except for the,
          paleness, it looked healthy, well-fed.
          The end came abruptly you could tell
          'cause the mouth froze in mid-sentence.
          "Shh.  ," the curled lips attempted. Like
          it started saying "shucks" or "Shirley"
          or... "shit happens." Your eyes don't
          forget things like that. Like you don't
          forget the sound animals make when
          they're humping. Primal.
          Raw. They endure
          in you forever because the senses have a
          brain all their own and they recall long
          after you've succumbed to the la-la of
          forgetfulness.
          (a pregnant beat)
          Sometimes when it's dark out,-so dark
          it's black, I'll see HIM.

          (BEAT)
          And it starts all over again.
          From this blackness, a streak of LIGHTNING splits the night sky.

          EXT. SKY - NIGHT

           We are in the eye of a STORM, an angry mass of clo uds raging
          o f a howling WIND. across the black sky..It brings RAIN and THUNDER an d the swirl
          An ENTITY emerges from this moist darkness.
          weather and advances into our scope of visibilityies through the
          A FLASH, of lightning erupts and it illuminates the sky. We SEE
          the approaching entity as it hovers before us.
          It's a man.
          It's a man, plus.
          It's a SUPERHERO,
          garbed in an elastic dark-grey outfit - a faded RED CAPE extends b
          ehind him, thrashing against the wind and rain.
          This Superhero (30). Unshaven.
          Disheveled. Worn. A face
          chiselled with mileage.
          

          

          2.
          In the eyes, we can see his soul. Intense. Fierce. An exposed
          nerve, snagged in a fish hook.
          He hangs in the air, tired, rain-soaked, pissed-off.
          He stares down at the earth below and he beholds the saturated
          visage of SHEEPSHEAD BAY, a seaside Brooklyn neighborhood.
          And from the bowels of his very soul, this Superhero belches a
          thunderous ROAR. He pivots in the air and dives toward land.
          He slices through the downpour, arms extended, body erect,
          engulfed in the dimensions of his cape.
          The ground approaches, fast. He accelerates as if to embrace it.
          Velocity sucks up all remaining space and there is IMPACT.
          An EXPLOSION as he rips through the street surface, penetrating
          the asphalt - head first. Debris and concrete spew from the
          ruptured orifice as he disappears inside.
          There is an expulsion of subterranean pressure and it launches
          nearby manhole LIDS from their spots - they bounce and CLANG
          down the street like loose change.
          The rain continues its onslaught.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Rain sloshes against a kitchen window. Where the sink is. Not
          far from the kitchen table. Where the LONGFELLOW Family sits,
          dinner before them.
          HORUS (35) leans over his plate, eating his meal. Here idles a
          man of diminutive frame, bespectacled, placid - as harmless as
          low fat milk.
          He sits opposite MARY (30), frenetically appropriating food. A
          gentle beauty. entwined in maternal angst she is estrogen with an
          attitude.
          A meek little AARON (8), slouches between the folks - a BLACK
          EYE tattoos the left of his face. Aaron stares at the damn
          plate, finding no humor in eggplant.

          MARY
          The principal did'nothing. Like
          schoolyard terrorism is no worse than
          being tardy. What's the matter with
          education? Back when, you could go to
          school and learn about Betsy Ross and...
          mollusks and... not get stabbed on the
          way home.

          INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT

          A subway TRAM idles by a passenger ramp. STEAM hisses from its
          side and plumes into a wall of white mist.
          And from this cloud of angry vapors, a figure appears. He
          surfaces from the dark subway tunnel, a cool nonchalance in his
          gait.
          It is the Superhero, his identity safely concealed under the
          collar of a tattered TRENCHCOAT. He traverses the loading deck,
          PASSENGERS boarding and disembarking around him.
          He wades through them - to a deserted section of the subway. He
          strolls over to a CIGARETTE MACHINE, up against the grafetti-
          raped subway wall.
          On the wall, a line of profanity declares that...

          "YOUR MOTHER TAKES IT UP THE ASS."
          He surveys the machine. His right arm appears from the coat
          pocket. Fingers merge into a tight fist. And casually, he rips
          into the metal vendor like it was Jello.
          His fist withdraws a handful of bills, coins. He pockets the
          loot. He reaches back in and withdraws a carton of LUCKY STRIKE.
          Deposits it under his coat.
          And with that, he heads for the stairs - to the flooded streets
          above.
          At the ramp, and on cue, the subway tram closes its doors.
          Trembles. Moves. Steams into the deep dark tunnel. White SMOKE
          mushrooms from its tail. It lingers in the air as we...

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          see STEAM, rising from a faucet of running HOT water.
          It rises from a sink of soiled dishes - where Mary deposits
          another set of pots. She's clearing the table.
          Down a dark hallway, a streak of light escapes from an open
          door. Inside and on the bed, the frail posture of Horus changes
          out of his clothes.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Horus disrobes down to his t-shirt and briefs. He stands before
          the closet mirror, scrutinizing the emaciated, sand-kicked-in-
          the-face body.


          5.
           Horns strikes
           a He-man pose, his
           biceps in the
           wind.

           He removes the Police apparel,
           plastic. Proceeds to put it on.

   
          INT. RED


          EYE MOTEL - NIGHT

          FISH
          How the fuck can I help you sir?


           SUPERHERO
          A room.
     

          

          6.
          His blood-shot eyes mean it.
          Fish turns to the back wall. Grabs a random KEY from a nail.

          FISH
          Top floor, 7F. Fifteen a pop, up front.
          (re: the check-in sheet)
          And your John Hancock makes it sweet.
          The Superhero scrutinizes the CHECK-IN sheet. Scribbles

          HANCOCK
          on the dotted line.
          Fish hands over the key. Then, pulls it back from Hancock's
          grab.

          FISH (CONT'D)
          I don't take messages, I don't do favors,
          and I don't know you from Jack. You want
          sheets, they're extra. Towel's extra.
          Plunger's extra.

          HANCOCK
          I need quiet. Is it quiet?

          FISH
          Quiet? Hey pal, we look like a public
          library to you? The girls work. Some of
          them scream, some of them moan...

          (SMILES)
          and some of them just kinda lay there
          cold. You want quiet, I got cotton balls
          you can stick in your ear. They're extra.

          Hancock eyes Fish, mentally dissecting the vermin with his bare
          hands. He withdraws from his coat the WAD of loot. Pushes it
          under the window.

          And while Fish collects, he leans into the window and emits a
          deep GROWL. Fish recoils. The bills fly.

          Hancock takes the key. Exchanges it with a metal ORB - the
          strangulated remains of the bell. It rolls out of his palm and
          CLINKS off the counter.
          Hancock sidles off. Fish - the cat's got his tongue.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Horus, in full uniform - dark blue pants, shirt.

          

          

          

          

          7.
          He dips into a dresser, pulls out a thick black leather belt -
          complete with holster.

          Horus returns to the dresser for one final item - It's obscured
          by his arm but we feel it to be some heavy chunk of metal.
          He confronts the mirror, twirls this piece, holsters it. And we
          SEE it to be a FLASHLIGHT.
          A shoulder patch reads...

          U-RENT SECURITY CO.
          Their motto: "TO OBSERVE AND RECORD"
          Horus tucks a hat under his arms, ready to move.

          INT. AARON'S ROOM - NIGHT

          A jar of MARBLES rests upon a window ledge. Outside, the story
          is rain.
          On a bed, sprawled on his back, Aaron gazes up at the empty
          ceiling - the black eye squats prominently on his face.
          Aaron brings his hand before his eyes. Looks at it. Studies it.
          Slowly, his fingers converge into a tight FIST - a boy's
          interpretation of a man's weapon.
          A gentle KNOCK disperses the knuckles. Horus peers in.

          HORUS
          How's the eye?

          AARON
          Black.
          Horus enters.
          Stands awkwardly before his son.

          HORUS
          It'll be gone in a week. Mom'11 touch it
          up with some make-up and you won't even
          know it's there.

          AARON
          Yeah I will. And I don't want any girly
          make-up on my face.
          Horus deposits himself on the bed. Hunches over-h13 knees.

          

          

          

          

          B.

          HORUS
          (almost apologetically)
          There'll always be people around
          who'll... exert force over those of us
          who just want to live in peace.
          Aaron listens, observing his father's efforts.

          HORUS (CONT' D)
          (pain in every word)
          The thing to do is... to avoid them.
          They're no-wins. Can't-wins. You hold the
          anger... and move on. You hold the anger.
          (turns to Aaron)
          I tell you because I can't take it,
          seeing you hurt. You're part of me.

          (BEAT)
          I've felt what you're feeling now. And if
          you've got any of me in you, you're gonna
          feel what I felt-when you go up against
          one of 'em. Turn away... that's what you
          do... the other cheek. You do that for
          me. No, you're not the coward. Not you.
          No. I'll be the coward, all right? 'Cause
          I don't want to see you hurt. I love you.
          I ask you to do that for me... your old
          man.
          And while he utters these words, Mary watches from the dark
          hallway - moved b y his affection.
          She oversees a father-son embrace.

          HORUS (CONT'D)
          I'm late for work. Get some sleep.
          Tomorrow always feels better...

          AARON
          .after a good night sleep.
          The light FLICKS off and the man's silhouette form exits the
          room.

          INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Horus backs his way out. Shuts the door. Mary's hand greets him
          from behind.
          It startles the man. He.tries to regroup.

          HORUS
          Mary.

          

          

          

          

          9.
           Mary inches closer - passion oozes from every pore. She nestles
          up against her husband.
           Horus stands uncoordinated, pressing his hands against her back.
          He is gentle, but as effective as an armless masturbator.
           Mary caresses his neck. Moves her lips to his ear, enraptured

          BY
          the moment.
          And out of nowhere...

          HORUS (CONT'D)

          (AWKWARD)
          I'm late.
          Mary snaps from her trance. Unshackles her hold, like she almost
          expected it.

          MARY

          (DISAPPOINTED)
          Right.

          (BEAT)
          Coffee's by the door.
           She marches back into the kitchen. Horus stares at his feet.
          S hakes his fists, mentally kicking himself in the face.
           He settles for the door, grabs hisjac ke , coffee thermos. A
           look at Mary and he's out thedoo rt

           And while the storm rages outside, Mary burns in a feverish
          sweat. The swelling steam and running ho t water combine to
          saturate her chest and face - she drips.
           Mary gazes out at the wet abyss, possessed by some inner
          longing.

          INT. MOTEL ROOM (7F) - NIGHT

          A T.V. SET. It MOANS from the corner of a room. Scant

          On a shredded s, blotched with urine and cum, we SEE a
          trenehc -lï¿½n open carton of cigarettes accompanies the
          picture.
          An open door faces the MOANING TV set. It's the bathroom and
          it's occupied by the intensely frazzled image of Hancock.
          He squats on the TOILET, pants around the ankles, cape shrouded
          around him.
          Those unforgiving eyes plant on the TV screen, a cigarette
          dangling from the corner of his lip.
          We discern the MOANS to be human and we SEE that he is watching
          a PORNO flick - flashes of flesh upon flesh in a fucking frenzy.

          T.V. SET (O.S.)

          (FEMALE)
          Ooh yeah, big fella. That's it. Shoot

          (male; in ecstasy)
          fly. YES! G0000D!
          Hancock absorbs the action from the can, a glint of pain on his
          face.
          He takes a long hard drag on the cigarette - a full stick
          deteriorates into ashes before our eyes.
          And outside, it rains like there's no tomorrow.

          Morning brings a cease-fire on precipitation. The streets

          INT. RED EYE MOTEL (7F) - DAY

          An ASHTRAY buried under a mountain of butts.
          A bed unslept. The TV is on, commercialing some spring-fresh
          vaginal wash. The room sits empty.
          But the bathroom door is open. Inside, the supersuit peeled down
          to his waist, Hancock shaves.

          HANCOCK
          (mumbling; rehearsing)
          it's about responsibility... with
          what is empowered in you... to correct
          the ills of man.
          No foam. No gel. Just skin and the razor edge of his belt BUCKLE
          - it slices through stubble, clearing up a face that has yet to
          sleep.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)

          (AGAIN)
          it's about responsibility...
          Hancock reaches into the cabinet below the sink - pulls out a
          BOTTLE of 409 all-purpose cleaner...
          On the tube, the commercial segues way into...

          T.V. (O.S.)

          The SOUND of machine guns CRACKLE amidst mortar explosions and

          Hancock listens - it disturbs him. He whirls around, accosts the
          TV Rips it from the wall, throws it out the window. And a CRASH
          eradicates images of war and chaos.
          He returns to the bathroom. To the mirror. Proceeds to spray his
          teeth with 409...

          EXT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - DAY

          Behold this imposing, block-long behemoth of commerce and
          decadence. A shopper's wet dream, this is WATANABE'S SHOPPING

          EMPORIUM.
          From the street, notice the display windows - all mannequins
          come complete with outfit and ultra-erect nipples.
          As EMPLOYEES file into the service entrance, out comes Horus and
          Roheim. They head streetward, to the sidewalk.
          Roheim unscrews the battery cap from his flashlight. Takes a
          swig from its hollow interior.

          ROHEIM
          I'll just play out the rest of this Eight
          Ball...
          He laps up the last drop. Reloads it with a couple of batteries
          from his jacket.

          ROHEIM (CONT' D)
          (caps it)
          like that.
          Horus looks on - silent.

          

          

          

          

          14.
          A POLICE VEHICLE enters this urban landscape. It slows in front
          of them. The cops: RUTGER and ADAMS, two hairy-knuckled
          testosterone cases with nothing to do.

          RUTGER.
          (passenger seat)
          Boys...
          The cops smile at one another. A large SHOTGUN rests fully erect
          between them. And they drive off.
          Horus, watching them go, focuses in on the

          "TO SERVE AND PROTECT"
          of their vehicle.
          Roheim watches him - turning red with drama.

          ROHEIM
          Bastards... couldn't protect a pitcher of
          warm spit... couldn't find their
          asshole with common sense and a thumb.

          (BEAT)
          Like I been saying, it's their.loss. The
          jerk-offs, they don't got the heart...
          the sensitivity of a man like you.
          Horus tries to shrug off these words. No good - they stick like
          a thorn in the eye of his soul.

          ROHEIM (CONT'.D)

          (CONTINUING)
          Come on, let's go home.

          EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

          On the rooftop; the Red Eye Motel.
          A trenchcoated figure - we see him from the back, only. We
          recognize the broad of his shoulders and the red of his cape,
          peering out from a hole in his coat.
          A cloud of smoke lingers above his head, from an unseen
          cigarette. He stands before the Sheepshead neighborhood, ever so
          still.
          Something brews within this superman.

          The streets of Sheepshead: apartments, brownstones speckled with

          are the "esque" in Bro ly qu
          Through this hustle-bustle, we spot Mary and Aaron on their way

          TO

          BRADLEY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
          Schoolyard activities abound. Buses, bouncing balls, and hoards
          of screaming little anti-christs.

          Mary leads Aaron along the playground fence, the latter trying
          to pull ahead and away.

          MARY
          Will you slow down.

          AARON
          I know it. I know it.

          MARY
          I think I'm... slow down... I'm gaining
          weight. Honey, take a look at my waist.

          AARON
          What?

          MARY
          Is my dress too tight?

          AARON
          What? Nothing. It's fine.

          MARY
          Really, my waist isn't too big?

          AARON
          What? Not here, mom.

          MARY
          All right, already. Two-thirty. You do n't

          AARON
          (there is no god)
          Geez!
          He turns back. Plants a kiss on Mary's smiling cheeks.

          MARY
          Two-thirty.

          AARON
          All right, mom.
          He leaves, merging into the undulating sea of children.

          MARY
          (after him; in vain)
          You want anything from the store?
          He's gone.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          This is the Longfellow's street - lower-middle class but
          comfortable, quaint, safe. Mr. Longfellow, hustling through the
          street, takes us home.
          Greeting him at the entrance, at the mailboxes, is CLYDE BANNER
          (35). Quite large this tenant is, quite simply a Cro-Magnon Man.
          Clyde stands with the morning paper in hand, searching
          carelessly through. He finds the SPORTS PAGE. Hides it under his
          robe.

          CLYDE

          Clyde shoves the remains of the paper at Horus - in his face.

          CLYDE
          Picked this up for you.
          (pulls the paper back)
          Say thanks.

          HORUS
          Thanks.

          CLYDE

          He heads inside.
          Horus swallowing it. He unshuffles the paper, finding the front
          page. The headline reads...

          RAINSTORM HITS SHEEPSHEAD. NO END IN SIGHT.
          Horus checks the sky - a sinewy mesh of angry clouds. He lumbers
          inside.

          Mary moves through the street, embracing a grocery bag.
          She continues her way, purpose in every step. No window shopping
          bullshit for this woman - Mary's strong, beautiful.
          She crosses the street, her destination: CENTRAL FIDELITY BANK.
          A dark CHEVY eases pass Mary on this street, pulls to a stop.
          Mary continues forth, entering the bank.

          INT. BANK - DAY

          Sheepshead DENIZENS crisscross amok. People queue behind teller
          lines, taking care of business.
          Mary takes her place. She glances at the bank CLOCK - it's 10
          o'clock.

          A BEE spirals the air and lands on the sleeve of a nervous ARM.
          This arm protrudes from the dark Chevy, parked before the bank.
          The engine is running.
          The arm fidgets. SHOOS the insect away. With white knuckles, it
          grips the wheel.

          INT. BANK - DAY

          Same bank, same people. Mary awaits service in the same line.
          A MAN ambles pass Mary's line, up towards the front. He cuts off
          the person in front, an elderly WOMAN.

          WOMAN
          Hey, what's the idea?
          The man turns. Smiles. His smile fades, turning into a maniacal.
          grin. This man is TOM (35), as plainly evil as the eye can see.

          TOM
          You know what, you remind me of my
          grandma.
          Tom whips out a sawed-off SHOTGUN from his pants...

          Thanks, Granny!
          Of course, by now, people have realized the implications of the
          situation at hand. They begin to panic.
          On cue, two new GUNMEN, JERRY and JERRY (30's), emerge from the
          crowded bank, both revealing automatic RIFLES.
          Jerry #1 drops the SECURITY GUARD with the butt of his gun.
          As planned, they take aim at the surveillance CAMERAS on each
          end of the bank. BANG. BANG. They miss, much to Tom's chagrin.
          The crowd ducks, Mary among them. Terror grips,the queues.
          The Jerrys try again. BANG. BANG. No more cameras. And with
          ,Irâº that, Tom takes center stage. He leaps on the teller counter.

          Lips, legs, lungs - stuff prepubescent wet dreams are made of.
          Aaron, nestled mid-room, tries to keep his eyes straight.
          He steals a quick look to the back of the room: there, in the
          back, a BLONDE boy (8) sits chewing gum.
          This kid, from the slicked-back hair and rolled-up t-shirt
          sleeves, is a sub-species of vermin.

          (to phone)
          My koochie, woochie, oochie ooo...
          A BLAST rings out from Central Fidelity.
          Glass shatters from the entrance. A body, the security guard,
          tumbles out and onto the sidewalk.
          Blood and brain exits in OOZES where the bullet had entered -
          he's probably dead.

          

          

          

          

          24.
          The cops, Ted., Chad. Rutger and Adams - they all REACT, guns
          raised.

          INT. BANK - DAY

          Tom huddles by the entrance, gun smoking. Cool and suave has
          succumbed to psychotic. The Jerrys are nearby, nervous. As are
          the hostages, clumped together in fright.

          TOM

          (SNAPPED)
          I'm not gonna say it again, Ted!
          (re: hostages)
          swiss cheese. All of them!

          TED (O.S.)
          Time's running out, fellas!
          The hostages grimace, hell not so far away.

          TOM
          I want that car, Ted!

          EXT. BANK - DAY

          Ted punches Chad on the shoulders.

          TED
          Where's that car, Jesus!

          CHAD
          It's out getting your pizza.

          TOM (O.S.)
          . a car and I want it NOW!
          And on this cue, the sky answers with a thunderous surprise - a
          CAR comes CRASHING down before the bank entrance.
          It came from the clouds and it looks familiar - it's the getaway
          Chevy, bruised and punctured beyond recognition, its hubcaps
          still reeling from the impact.
          The sky answers again, this time with the tattered body of FRED,
          the getaway driver (alias, the arm.) Fred lands on the hood of
          the Chevy, sinking into its metal frame.
          SHOCK waves across faces of stone. The cops all look up.

          TED
          (at the sky)
          What the...

          

          

          

          

          25.
          There :;n the sky, a taped figure works his magic of flight. He
          examines the ground below. And he dives.
          Hancock approaches earth and swings lateral. He circumvents the
          bank structure, flying around and around.
          Everybody ducks. Trash and paper batter about behind his draft.

          INT. BANK - DAY

          Tom and the Jerrys stand shackled in their spots.
          Their eyes wander about, lost in confusion. The WHIR outside
          subsides. Stops.
          A loaded beat.
          Tom, in mid-swallow, watches as a spectacular EXPLOSION of
          bricks sprays the air inside. A caped figure bursts into the
          scene amidst SCREAMS from clueless hostages.
          in the blink of an eye, Hancock has Jerry #2 by the collar. With
          a flick of the wrists, Jerry #2 is a human projectile en route
          to the windshield of a police vehicle outside.
          Jerry #1 opens FIRE on Hancock. Bullets careen off flesh of
          steel.

          EXT. BANK - DAY

          Jerry #1 rides air and glass out and across the street into
          another awaiting police windshield.

          INT. BANK - DAY

          Smoke and debris smother the air. And as they subside, all eyes
          fall on the caped figure that is Hancock, erect in the rubble.
          Mary can't believe her eyes. She surveys every inch of his
          frame, now clean-shaven, combed, comic book perfect.
          Hancock scans the crowd of stunned hostages - his eyes pick out
          the WOMEN - Veronica's wet smile takes him.
          A heartbeat.

          HANCOCK

          (GOD)
          Everybody out, please.
          Bodies bang about, all moving for the door.

          

          

          

          

          26.
          Mary follows the herd out but her eyes remain on the caped
          figure, until real estate ushers her into the street.

          EXT. BANK - DAY

          PARAMEDICS converge on the hostages .
          The cops are at a loss - deers staring down a pair headlights.
          They train their guns on the bank, waiting for answers.

          INT. BANK - DAY

          The bank floor in shambles. No one in sight. But movement jars
          us to the back, where the bank SAFE is.
          We SEE Hancock wade through rubble towards the open safe, a
          thick steel chamber of commerce. Hancock arrives at the safe.
          Confronts the object inside - Tom.

          INT. BANK SAFE - DAY

          There he is, in the corner, a sweaty piece of misery. Tom bears
          his revolver, aimed at Hancock. Hancock enters the safe.

          TOM
          Stay away.
          Hancock does not respond.

          TOM (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          I'm not going back.
          Hancock turns, grabs the safe door. Slams it shut with a
          resounding THUD. They're locked in.

          TOM (CONT'D)

          (HYSTERICAL)
          What're you doing?
          Hancock does not respond.

          TOM (CONT'D)
          What's going on, here?
          Hancock no response. Tom raises his gun, and meaning it.

          TOM (CONT'D)
          Answer me! Say something!

          (FIRES)
          Fuck me!

          

          

          

          

          27.
          BANG! Tom fires a. shot off Hancock's forehead. The BULLET
          ricochets about the steel interior, under great velocity.
          It rips Tom's right EAR from his head.

          HANCOCK
          (catching the renegade slug)
          Why'd you go and do that for?
          Tom retrieves his ear from the ground. Tries to put it back,
          clutching his head. He bleeds.

          TOM
          Fuck... My shirt.

          HANCOCK
          (steps forward)
          Why don't we call it the day.

          TOM
          (gun raised)
          Don't. I told you... I'm not going back.

          HANCOCK

          (IRRITATED)
          If you're going to tease, cock the damn
          gun. Otherwise, spare me the wounded
          animal act of desperation. I don't got c,
          time for rhetoric and sympathy so. don't
          expect... dialogue and "come with me and
          you won't be hurt" bullshit. You walk out
          of here with me and your life is a
          violent storm. You will be hurt, you will
          be abused... whatever turns them on.
          Either way, your days are shit! Those are
          the realities, spelled out.

          TOM
          What's eating you, man?

          HANCOCK

          (UPSET)
          You got half the precinct out there,
          armed, trained to blow the tail off a
          sperm from a hundred yards... you're
          standing in here, cornered, three bullets
          left in that squirter of yours, if you're
          lucky, and you got one ear. I don't need
          the aggravation. I don't need this.

          TOM
          Man, you're jaded. I'm not asking for a
          rainbow...

          TOM (CONT' D)
          you don't got to shower me with respect.
          Just a little.. tenderness, is all. Have
          you no mercy, mister?

          HANCOCK
          (he's had enough)
          I'm all out. Let's go...
          And as he utters this, he approaches Tom.

          TOM

          (HURT)
          Fuck you.
          Close on his trigger finger. It tightens...

          HANCOCK

          NO!

          INT. BANK - DAY

          On the bank floor, where a group of cops now huddle, we hear
          THREE SHOTS - from the safe.

          EXT. ALLEY - DAY

          The schoolyard - it looms in the background, as a reference to
          where we are.
          Aaron occupies this alley and we see what he sees - trash and
          fire-escapes and ominous gray skies. DARK FIGURES move into this
          sight - they eclipse the heavens.
          And there Aaron is, twisted in a contorted heap of arms and legs
           - his body eternally locked within the stranglehold of SPENGLER
          and ERLICK (both his age.)
          Aaron's face, another BLACK EYE makes it a set. Rage distorts
          his mouth out of symmetry. He stares at PERCEVAL, before him -
          the blonde kid from class.
          We HEAR water, a stream of liquid-something SPLASHING about,
          SPRAYING. Perceval - he's taking a leak on Aaron's exposed leg.

          EXT. BANK - DAY

          The aftermath.
          Hancock is swarmed under MEDIA LIGHTS, reporters squeezing
          through a wall of people, police, trying to get a piece of this
          superman.

          

          

          

          

          29.
          We follow Hancock's scope amidst the melee it spots luscious
          Veronica again, it spots WOMEN, all who'd die for a chance to
          suck on his cape.

          CUT TO:

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Mary hastens after Aaron, urine-soaked and on the verge of
          tears. He rages down the street while his mother pursues.

          MARY
          Tell me... what happened?

          AARON
          (about to break)
          You were late.

          MARY
          I was held up...

          AARON
          The asshole peed on me. I'm dog shit.

          MARY
          .at the bank. Honey, were they the same
          ones? Don't cry.

          AARON
          Get a grip, mom.
          They arrive home, both storming through the entrance and up the
          stairs.

          EXT. APARTMENT - DAY

          The door SLAMS to signify arrival. School books go flying.
          Mother and son march down the hallway. They are greeted by
          Horus, sleep still on his face.

          HORUS
          How was your day?
          Mother and son - if eyes could disembowel.

          CUT TO:

          EXT. BUILDING - DAY

          Just your average professional building, several stories of
          brick and cement.

          

          

          

          

          30.
          But all is not well with this typically normal picture. On the
          top floor, outside and on the ledge - a JUMPER stands poised
          before blood and concrete. His TIE flaps in the wind.
          From an adjacent window, a SECRETARY, a FIREMAN attempt to get
          him down.

          JUMPER'

          (SELF-PITY)
          People ignore me.
          From his vantage - a congregation of PEOPLE swarm below in his
          honor. A woman cradling a BABY watches from a building window
          across the street.

          FIREMAN
          Mr. Fisher.

          SECRETARY
          (through her teeth)
          You're not unattractive.

          FIREMAN
          Baldness is not fatal.

          JUMPER
          My wife ignores me.

          FIREMAN
          Your wife's a cunt, Mr. Fisher.

          SECRETARY
          We like you, Mr. Fisher. The girls
          acknowledge you, we all do.

          JUMPER
          No.

          SECRETARY
          Yes.

          JUMPER
          Really?
          The secretary SCREAMS. All attention shifts to the BUILDING
          across the street. The secretary points...

          EXT. OPPOSITE BUILDING - DAY

          There...

          

          

          

          

          31.
          on the top floor, outside and on the ledge - the baby seen
          earlier, diaper-clad, crawls precariously on the rim of doom.
          His mother's FREAKING from the window.
          Below, the crowd makes its way across the street. They point and
          gasp at the infant's every movement - leaving the jumper by his
          lonesome.
          The baby teeters along the edge. It heads for a FLAG pole,
          dazzled by the red-white-and-blue. It reaches out at fabric.
          Almost. Not quite. The baby DROPS from the precipice.
          On the street, people CHOKE on their tongues as gravity pulls
          the infant down.
          But wait... Hancock swoops out of the thin blue, swift and
          silent. He cradles the baby from utter concrete.
          He deposits the youngster with.the ecstatic crowd - they, of
          mostly the FEMALE persuasion, all form around the savior.
          We SEE in the background and across the street, the Jumper nose-
          diving into the sidewalk - without much fanfare.

          CUT TO:

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          An apartment building engulfed in FLAMES. FIRE TRUCKS don't even
          bother with the hoses - it's too late. Around them, TENANTS
          bemoan the loss of...
          Like a wrecking ball, Hancock BURSTS through the burning rubble
          and surfaces clean on the other side of the building.
          Blanketed under his cape are two little TODDLERS, and a young
          WOMAN in bra and panties. He lowers them to safety.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          We're in the hallway. Where Horus kneels. He's bent listening
          into Aaron's bedroom, in his security clothes. By the TV and in
          her apron, Mary watches the news...

          NEWS
          . paramedics have taken the rescued
          tenants to County General for smoke

          We see FOOTAGE of the dramatic fire rescue: Hancock recovering
          tenants from the pyre - plebs and dwellers cheer in exaggerated
          astonishment.

          HORUS

          Mary?
          Mary blinks back her attention.

          HORUS (CONY' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          Why is he mad at me?

          MARY
          He's looking for answers. He's Upset.

          HORUS
          (tapping the door)
          Let me see your eye...
          (to Mary)
          I told him about the other cheek. Avoid
          confrontations... to turn the other
          cheek.

          MARY
          .He did. He turned the other cheek and
          they punched it.

          Aaron.

          MARY
          You're late. I'll try again later.
          Horus finds his hat on the table. His eyes fall on Mary, her
          back to him. She's glued to the set.

          HORUS '
          How... what about you?

          MARY

          (ALOOF)
          What?
          Horus turns his focus to the TV - more Hancock FOOTAGE. He
          watches Mary.

          Horns - hat in hand, goes to the door. He wants to stay.

          Good thing he was there. I don't know
          what I'd do... if you...
          Mary does not hear him... until the door SHUTS behind her. She
          turns to face an empty room.

          MARY
          Coffee's by the... door.

          INT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

          A room, a place we don't know. It's dark save the street light
          outside. A rhythmic POUNDING reverberates through this darkness.
          More intense it becomes.
          And then a high-pitch GASP. Two individuals, man and woman,
          stumble into view - their silhouettes obscure the window.
          They're locked at the hips, pumping away like high-revving
          pistons.
          For a second, light dances off the woman's aroused face: it's
          Veronica.

          VERONICA
          (a her voice trembles)
          Oh god.
          The man surfaces from her cleavage for air, his face wet with
          sweat and saliva. He brushes his cape away from his arm.
          Veronica uncoils yet another orgasm, her back arched, her
          breasts beckoning at ceiling.
          Quite abruptly, he lets her go. Rights his pants. Unlatches the
          window. She paws after him.

          And with that, he floats out into the night.

          Horus. His walk. Unaware of everything but the storm inside his
          head.
          He crosses an alley. A band of THUGS, neighborhood kids of
          malcontent, surprises him. And. versa. They recoil at his
          uniform, his gun.
          They quickly realize that he's rent-a-security.
          The leader speaks first - he's SCARPO (25), as tough as a steel-
          belted radial. The others regroup their DRUGS.

          SCARPO
          Nutri-cop.

          EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

          A streetlight HUMS. Blinks - revealing a deserted alley in'
          sporadic intervals. Garbage, etc.
          A slight drizzle shimmers pass the streetlight. Pelts a soulful
          Hancock below - he moves through the gray dreariness in
          solitude.

          

          

          

          

          35.
          He reaches behind his e. withdraws a box of cigarettes.
          Taps himself a stick.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          How about spreading some of that joy?
          Hancock turns and faces a young HOODLUM, scraggly in his own
          slimy kind of way.
          In a huff, he shoves Hancock up against the building. Presses a
          gun to Hancock's temple.

          HOODLUM

          (PSYCHOTIC)
          Better yet, why don't I just take it...
          Hancock - enraged. In a caffeinated blink, he has the Hoodlum by
          the throat via one arm, the gun with the other.

          HANCOCK

          (SUPER-PSYCHOTIC)
          What are you thinking?
          The Hoodlum notices that he's dangling a foot off the ground -
          one of his SNEAKERS remains in its spot from the swift jolt.
          The other sneaker teeters on his one foot... and falls to the
          pavement.

          HOODLUM
          (fuck me)
          Shit...

          HANCOCK
          What are you thinking?!
          Hancock wrests the gun from his hand. Places it into his own
          mouth. FIRES two slugs inside. The Hoodlum FREAKS.

          HANCOCK (CONT' D )
          Huh?!
          Takes the smoking gun out of his mouth. Shoves it up the-
          Hoodlum's nose.

          HANCOCK (CONY' D)
          Want to see brain? Huh?!
          Sticks the gun back into his mouth. FIRES another shot inside.
          Takes it out and this time - jams it into the Hoodlums mouth.
          The Hoodlum proceeds to urinate in his pants.

          

          

          

          

          36.

          HOODLUM
          (with his mouth full)
          Please, mister. I got a baby coming.., a
          wife. I got student loans...
          Hancock - intense.
          Is this getting through?

          HOODLUM (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          please. Have a heart, mister.
          Hancock - the fire inside subsides. Cools to a rational state.
          He lowers the. Hoodlum.
          He spits the three SLUGS into his hand. Deposits them in the
          Hoodlum's breast pocket. Walks away.

          INT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - NIGHT

          In the closing hours of business, employees pell-mell about in
          preparation for departure.
          A group of LADIES form around a display T.V., taking in with
          frothy wetness every inch of Hancock's footage. They gasp
          amongst themselves.
          Horus enters the picture, jacket and thermos. He notices the TV -
          it's like he can't escape the good news.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          The TV set.
          More news on the day's activities. Mary sits mesmerized on the
          sofa, holding a dish she had planned to dry.
          Aaron surfaces from the hallway, lured out by the TV He comes up
          behind Mary - his black eyes on the news.

          MARY

          (SURPRISED)
          You're still up.

          AARON
          Can't sleep.
          He rolls over the sofa, next to his mother.
          They watch VIDEO clips of the foiled bank heist: the crashing
          Chevy, the aerial maneuvers, the sheer invincibility of this
          man.

          (IMPRESSED)
          That's him?

          MARY
          There's something about him... I don't
          know.
          A female REPORTER concludes the footage...

          REPORTER

          (FAINTLY)
          And so we ask... who is this man?
          Speculation abounds - government super-
          experiment, an aberration of nature, or
          extraterrestrial renegade? Who are you?
          Where are you now, superguy? Call me.

          (SMILES)
          We'll get together. Have a drink.

          INT. BAR - NIGHT

          HADES - a smoky bar in the armpit of town.
          NEON beer signs. POOL tables. CIGARETTE machines. This is home
          to mean people, tough guys - children of a fucked-up god.
          We cut through the nicotine air to find the bar. A figure
          hunches on the far end, smoking. Popping vodka like mountain
          water in Dixie cups.
          It's Hancock and his trenchcoat. The long day wears heavy on his
          face - those perpetually red eyes, the horror they've seen.

          HANCOCK

          (MUTTERING)
          What he's got to do... a man's got to do
          it.

          EXT. BAR - NIGHT

          Hancock stumbles out, incognito, frazzled under his guise. Up
          above, the sky - so dark under the storm clouds.
          We HEAR commotion in the side alley. And so does Hancock. He
          peers into the alley.
          There, by a lighted PHONE BOOTH, a WHORE is fending off a horny
          JOHN. Hancock simply watches she drives her knee between his
          legs. He drops. SQUEALS like a little girl.
          The John finds a two-by-four in the dirt. He reaches for it...

          

          

          

          

          38.
          A COUGH stops him - it's Hancock and he discourages further
          violence.
          Up and out of the alley, the John flees - tail, between his
          legs.
          A long stare ensues - Hancock and the Whore, looking into each
          other's eyes for answers.
          The Whore approaches him. Touches his face - studies it. Moves
          it into the light.

          WHORE
          (the sage)
          You've been to Hell, it looks. And you're
          tired...

          (BEAT)
          and in need.
          Hancock - his eyes agree.
          The Whore lifts her skirt, reaching into her panties. She takes
          out a MATCHBOOK.
          Hands it to him.

          WHORE (CONY' D)
          My business card.
          (to the phone booth)
          My office.
          Hancock inspects the matchbook - 555-GINA, etched inside.

          HANCOCK

          (GEENA)
          Gina.

          WHORE

          Aaron's room, his nightlight the only source of light. Mary sits
          on the bed, by her son.

          AARON
          Don't.

          EXT. SKY - NIGHT

          From the black night - a dark figure plummets, caroms off the
          side of a building, strikes the metal fire-escapes, crashing
          into the trash cans below.
          Hancock stumbles from the wreckage, the garbage. Falls. He leans
          against the building, glazed over with drunkenness.
          He turns to the only source of light that of a building across
          the street: KILLYBEGS TEXTILES, looming above the rest. Boarded-
          up windows indicate abandonment - an urban relic.
          He stares at the building - perhaps sparing more attention than
          we think it deserves.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Mary swallows. Starts in on the tune.

          MARY
          "Once there was a way, to get back
          homeward. Once there was a way, to get

          Shut up.

          EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

          There, on his ass, his head a raging inferno - Hancock listens,
          as if he can hear.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Aaron, succumbing to his mother's song - his lids flutter.

          MARY
          "Sleep pretty darling, do not cry. And I

          EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

          Something overcomes this fevered superman. He begins to unravel.
          A calm consumes him. Tames him. It could be Mary's voice - maybe
          he can hear it, and then maybe not.

          MARY (V.O.)
          "Golden slumber fills your eyes. Smiles
          awake you when you rise."
          Hancock wavers on consciousness - quite unlike him.

          MARY (V.O.) (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          "Sleep pretty darling, do not cry. And I

          And like that, a seamless fade into peace - he sleeps.

          Erratic traces of an urban landscape JAG about.
          Aaron's distorted view of his neighborhood comes sharp and in
          flashes as he is pursued by his tormentors.
          Spengler. Erlick. Perceval. They chase him from behind, HOOTING,
          taunting poor Aaron - they're out for blood.
          Aaron cuts into an alley, lungs pumping...

          EXT. ALLEY - DAY

          .. but a brick wall stares him down, providing no exit. He
          swallows hard.
          FOOTSTEPS approach, just seconds away. Close on Aaron, as blood
          drains from his face. His eyes dash for a garbage CAN - but is
          there time?
          Spengler. Erlick. Perceval. They can smell their prey.

          (just arriving)
          Let's rock it up.
          They turn the corner, attack mode. Aaron, nowhere in sight. Just
          the brick wall and a trash can.
          They converge, baffled. Erlick inspects the solid wall. Spengler
          scratches his head. But'Perceval's no fool. He spots the trash
          can.
          He motions the fellas over. They circle the can. A beat. They
          ATTACK... an empty can. No one inside. Nothing.
          That's because above them, no strings and no cables, Aaron
          hovers - under Hancock's capable arm.
          In mid-air, they hang for a second. Then, Hancock takes them
          away.

          EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

          Mary stands at the designated pick-up spot, pacing like her
          bladder's going to break.

          EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

          A secluded view of the city, high above. Hancock, Aaron under
          his arms, rides a light breeze - and then lands.
          Aaron scampers away. Turns and faces the man.
          Hancock examines the boy's face, the black eyes. He shakes his
          head. Disappointed.
          He reaches for his belt. Pulls out a cigarette. Lights it.

          HANCOCK
          You smoke?

          AARON
          What?

          HANCOCK
          Of course you don't. Nothing but a kid.
          (beat; takes a puff)
          Smoke no evil.
          Hancock moves over to Aaron, now backed in a corner.

          (re: cigarette)
          Ever curious... .what it's like?

          Go on... give it a try. One time. Won't
          kill you. Once.
          Aaron under pressure, acquiesces. He takes the stick. Sucks on
          it. Doubles over, coughing.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)
          Good, huh? Tastes like compost... your
          first stick. Then, after a few more... it
          starts getting this. flavor. A little
          nicotine buzz. A while passes and all of
          a sudden, it's as sweet as candy. Only
          now, it takes a whole pack to get
          there.., and you won't settle till your,
          mouth's as sweet.
          Hancock takes another cool drag - Mr. Wisdom waxing
          philosophical.

          change. Can start by changing some

          AARON
          Principles?

          HANCOCK
          Principles. Here's one; very simple. Just
          about all you need to know: a man's got
          to do what a man's got to do.
          (beat; smokes)
          I look at your face, the shiners. You
          took a shove and you let it go clean. Not
          good. That's a formula for future
          abuse... an invitation to the loser's
          dance. Letting it go. Walking away.
          ,(shakes head)
          Bad policy. Won't be long 'fore you're
          running, looking for a place to hide.

          AARON
          What am I suppose to do?

          HANCOCK
          You do what is necessary.

          AARON
          I wanted... there were three of them.

          HANCOCK
          What is necessary.

          (HEAT)
          Let me tell you something, kid. There was
          this infantry unit, you see... badly
          outnumbered.
          (thinks about it)
          Wait, let me put it in kid terms. So you
          relate, OK? There's a fox, you relate? A
          fox and he's walking through what, the
          woods, the forests, right? Next thing the
          fox knows, he's staring down a pack of...
          hounds. Bloodhounds. And there's this
          chase, the fox's running his ass off,
          over boulders and through streams and,
          but the damn hounds are still on his
          tail. Finally the fox comes to this
          cliff, a precipice... and it's what, a
          seven hundred foot drop onto jagged
          rocks. He's in trouble 'cause the hounds
          are closing in and they're going to tear
          him to pieces. So what does he think...
          "I jump and I die for sure. I stay,
          confront them and I'll get my ass
          butchered." Decision time. He thinks,
          "stay and least I'd have something, a
          chance.

          To slip away, maybe." The fox decides to
          go down fighting, make a stand. Right?

          (BEAT)
          The hounds come. What do you think
          happens?

          AARON
          (thinking about it)
          He gets away.
          Hancock inhales what's left of his cigarette. Blows smoke.

          HANCOCK
          No. The fox gets his ass kicked and
          some... I mean ripped apart by the dogs,
          like cheap fabric.

          AARON
          What're you saying?

          HANCOCK
          But you know, when the last hound was
          through with him,-and he's walking away,
          he hears this noise. It's the fox and
          he's muttering something under his
          breath... words. The dog goes over. Gets
          up close. To hear what he's saying. You
          know what the fox's saying... just before
          he keels off?
          Aaron - negative.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          Now he's gurgling, choking on his own 
          blood, right? A massacre. The fox's lying
          next to his entrails, you know... and you
          know what he says?
          (raises his fist in the air)
          "No regrets."

          AARON
          What?

          HANCOCK
          No regrets. You make a decision and you
          stick to it. Like a man's got to do. And
          "no regrets."
          Aaron - submitting it to memory.

          AARON
          Why're you telling me all this?

          

          

          

          

          45.

          HANCOCK

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Through the street darts Mary, eyes berserk in search for herher
          son. She looks at her watch. And up... up ahead, by steps
          apartment - Aaron, levitating in air.
          Hancock explains this defiance of gravity. He gently lowers
          Aaron on the sidewalk, before his mother.
          She beckons him. Like a shield, she envelops him with her arms.
          She stares up at Hancock - her eyes, stricken with fear. Or
          possibly, they were awestruck.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Horus, in his bed - smothered in slumber.
          He begins to stir, wrestling some unseen dream. He wakes, in
          defeat.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Close on a TV set, featuring a COMMERCIAL - in mid-hype. A
          portly man states his purpose.
          His name tag reads - DR. HOLE.

          DR. HOLE
          at the Hole Institute, our
          experienced staff and cutting-edge
          technology means you need not spend

          hemorrhoidal flare-ups. Also, for anal
          fissures, warts, and secondary yeast
          infections, the institute is your
          complete rectal service clinic.

          And remember, I'm not just the Hole
          Institute spokesperson. I'm also a
          client.
          As Dr. Hole proceeds to exhibit an enlarged PHOTOGRAPH of his
          hemorrhoidal tissues, the TV channel changes. A NEWS program, in
          progress.

          

          

          

          

          46.
          On the living room sofa squats. Hancock, remote in hand.

          crowded market place in...
          Hancock staring into footages of bedlam, bloodshed. From the TV
          set, maternal CRIES spew forth grief and anguish.
          Hancock grabs the remote. Fumbles around for the power button.
          He pumps the volume instead - the WAILS intensify his state of
          panic, pain.
          CLICK. Mary - by the tube, switches off the mayhem. She studies
          his reaction, now marked with relief.

          MARY

          (SAVIOR)
          Are you OK?

          HANCOCK
          I'm sorry.

          MARY

          (NERVOUS)
          I came in to... hope you like chicken.
          Hancock nods, watching Mary as she retreats into the kitchen. He
          continues to stare - at Mrs. Longfellow, in frenetics, prepping
          for dinner.
          She catches him looking... looking surreal, this superman, there
          on her sofa.
          A calm, while they stare. And then...

          AARON (O:S.)
          Table's done.
          Mary turns to Aaron, offscreen.

          MARY
          Glasses.

          AARON (O.S.)
          Geez.
          Horus enters from the hallway, disheveled from sleep. He does
          not see the superman on his sofa. He continues into the kitchen.

          

          

          

          

          47.
          Mary stares at him. Aaron appears, also staring at him. Horus
          does a "what?" with his shoulders. Mother and son gesture behind
          him.
          He turns and beholds: Hancock,' rising in full garb, arm
          extended. All eyes on Horus - befuddled.

          MARY
          You know Hancock?

          AARON
          He comes for dinner.
          Close on Hancock. Close on Horus.

          HANCOCK
          Man of the house?

          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Dinner is served. All the key players, present. Horus sits
          facing his son - dethroned by the distinguished visitor. Mary
          serves.

          MARY
          (to Hancock)
          Which piece would you like?

          HANCOCK
          Breasts, please.
          Horus, watching everything - Mary and her every blush.

          AARON
          You want milk?

          HANCOCK
          No. It gives me gas. Thank you.
          A beat - as everyone visualizes a superFART.

          AARON
          It makes mom fart, too.
          Mary CHOKES on her food.
          Drops her fork. She maneuvers, in the allotted space, for the
          utensil - and finding difficulty.
          Hancock grabs the table, one arm. Lifts it off the carpet and
          above everyone's head. Mary, startled, impressed, all of the
          above. She picks up the fork.

          Horus - a chicken leg dangling from his lips, in mid-chew,.
          looking impotent.

          AARON (CONT'D)
          Good arm.

          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Later.

          HANCOCK
          not about the labor... or the love of
          it.
          (beat; we've heard this before)
          .It's about responsibility... with what is
          empowered in you. The gift of might.
          Might to.do what? Exploitation, because
          you can? Or a different path. To purvey
          justice. To correct the ills of man...
          because I can.
          Faces of profound confusion - Mary and Aaron. But they are
          charmed, his words secondary to his charisma.
          Horus, the quiet observer, observes.

          HANCOCK (CONY' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          so, a job? Yes. And no. It's about...
          essence. The essence of the man... not
          his clothes. It's the job. Take away the
          arm,. the leg..., his bodily possessions
          but not his trade, his profession. That
          case, you strip him of what he is... a
          man.
          Horus a firm grasp of the concept.

          HANCOCK (CONY' D)
          What line of work are you in, Mr.
          Longfellow?

          HORUS
          (clearing throat)
          Oh, it's not like you... what you do or
          anything. A department store over on
          Third.

          MARY
          Horus is in the securities business.

          HORUS
          I'm a security guard. I'm just...

          

          

          

          

          49.
          Aaron rises from the table. Goes over to the fridge.

          MARY
          It's a large department store, over a
          couple million in merchandise... stereos,
          jewelry. On three floors.

          HORUS
          It's a night job. I sit around.

          HANCOCK
          You're a security guard. You keep the
          state of things. It's a job. You do it.

          (PAUSE)
          We're in the same business.
          Aaron returns with the ketchup bottle.
          A frozen moment while Horus ponders the implications. He stares
          at the BOTTLE.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)
          Aaron, could you show me the restroom?
          Aaron points first door in the hall.

          AARON
          On the right.
          He leaves to find bladder relief - leaving Horus to his family.

          AARON (CONT' D)
          What do you think, mom?

          MARY
          (in a whisper)
          Horus, what do I do?

          HORUS
          (at his watch)
          I need to get ready.

          AARON
          mom?

          MARY
          (to Horus)
          What do I do with him... when you're
          gone? I have to entertain this super...
          She doesn't finish her... A NOISE interrupts her - seizes the
          participants.

          

          

          

          

          50.
          It comes from the bathroom - the sound of PISS, urine versus the
          surface tension.of water.
          LOUD. WET. A turgid firehose at full blast. The force of
          urination grips the room - as powerful as the penile mechanism
          from which it is generated.
          The toilet FLUSHES. Hancock returns to a'room of astonished
          faces - mouths agape.

          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Later,. by a few minutes.

          HANCOCK
          (lost; sombre)
          and you could see the flames, through
          the storm... I get there, the vessel's
          all over, spread across three miles of
          South Pacific. Bodies floating in the
          water, shoes, kids who'd thought it some
          routine reconnaissance joyride. Turns
          out, the only one alive was the captain,
          up against a buoy... crying 'cause he
          didn't go down with his men... and he's
          got to live with it.

          (BEAT)
          Sprayed his brain all over the dashboard
          in a parking lot a couple months after. A
          good man...
          (at Aaron)
          . did what he had to do.
          A brief moment while the graphics sink in. No one talks. Aaron's
          smitten. Mary, a mixture of repulsion and fascination.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          In the kitchen, in the sink, stacks of plates indicate that
          dinner is through.
          Company has moved into the living room, with the exception of
          Horus. Aaron kneels besides Hancock. Mary, across from him.

          AARON
          (making a fist)
          I wanted to kill him.

          MARY
          Aaron.

          

          

          

          

          51.

          AARON
          I want to deck him, just once. So bad I
          tense up... like I can't even move.

          MARY
          (to Hancock)
          He comes home crying.

          AARON
          Did not. Not crying. It was pissed-off.

          HANCOCK

          (REACTS)
          No... there's no shame in it. The crying.
          It's relief...
          (to Mary)
          we're older and we don't remember
          when... we go, "God, when was the last
          time?" Maybe it's me. It's more an
          effort, now. Takes more pain... more
          blood. Like it's, do you have the time
          anymore? Even to look back and recall a
          moving experience. To be moved.

          (AARON)
          By rage. Hurt.

          (MARY)
          By love.

          (BEAT)
          But if you have to remember the last time
          something touched you... you've missed it
          - you've forgotten how to cry.
          Horus enters the room, Mr. Security Guard. He observes this
          magic Hancock works over his wife and kid - a talent whose
          nature he has yet to comprehend.
          Horus opts to not disturb their trance. He makes for the door.
          Hancock - holds him accountable.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)

          (AWARE)
          Mr. Longfellow. I'll be leaving, too.

          HORUS
          Oh, I... you don't have to leave. I don't
          want to interfere. I have work.

          MARY
          (the original sin)
          Oh, I forgot to make coffee.
          She rushes into the kitchen. Horus stops her.

          

          

          

          

          52.

          HORUS
          It's all right, Mary. I'm late.

          MARY
          No, I'll make it right now.

          HORUS
          I don't have time. I'll grab some on the
          way. Thanks.
          Mary accepts it - not entirely guilt-free.

          HORUS (CONT' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          I don't want to interrupt. Please don't
          let me stop you.

          HANCOCK
          No, I need to go.
          (at' Mary and only Mary)
          The last time I had a meal... an evening
          like this, I was... it was too long ago.
          I appreciate your kindness.

          MARY

          (AWKWARD)
          Please... you're welcome, here. Anytime.
          Horus watches everything - watching her chest heave under
          Hancock's every word, watching his wife slip away.

          HANCOCK
          Aaron. Tomorrow. After the bell. I'll
          drop by after school. See how you're
          doing.

          AARON

          (SMILES)
          Yeah.
          Horus watches this - his son slipping away.
          The two men leave, Hancock ushering Horus out first.
          Mary closes the door behind them. Leans against the door and
          EXHALES - a sign of relief, of despair, or, of a heart raging
          wild.
          We just .don't know.

          

          

          

          

          53.

          EXT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          The two men appear from the entrance, shoulder to shoulder -
          sort of. They enter the street.

          HORUS

          (POINTING)
          I'm this way.
          Hancock points the opposite way.

          HANCOCK
          Need a lift?

          HORUS
          It's a short walk.
          Acknowledged.
          An awkward beat while they stare at each other...
          . until finally, they go their separate ways - Horus via walk
          and Hancock, with effortless grace,, via flight.
          From the sidewalk and awe-stricken - Horus watches Hancock merge
          into the blackness. A look of dread squats on his face.

          squats on the bed, his brain going a mile a minute. He plops
          back against the bed. Brings his hand up to his face. Makes a
          fist. Thinking. Wondering.

          AARON
          Me neither. I was thinking.., about
          tomorrow.

          MARY
          Go to sleep. You know what dad says.
          Tomorrow always feels better...

          AARON
          I know, mom... after a good night sleep.
          He says that but he's the one working
          every night. Does that mean he never
          feels better? He's always feeling
          terrible?

          MARY

          (AMUSED)
          Go to bed, anyway.
          She tucks him-in.. Turns off the lamp. And as she's out the
          door...

          AARON
          Mom?
          She turns.

          Time lapses into the late hours. This town experiences a serene
          moment - a peacefulness which says that this as night as a night
          will be.

          INT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - NIGHT

          Looking down aisles of merchandise - not a trace of life and not
          unlike a cemetery.
          All is dead, with the exception of FOOTSTEPS - shoes pacing
          linoleum. It's Horus, on duty. His flashlight leads the way...

          Outside, the SIRENS of police vehicles charge by - real men en
          route to real work.
          Horus watches them from the window - like a kid who can't come
          out to play.
          He turns to look across the floor - Roheim, against a chair,
          watching the NEWS on a big-screen TV

          It's dark out here in the night. On the roof. Overlooking the
          community, the Longfellow's apartment building... and Mary's
          bedroom.
          From here, we can SEE her - entering from the hallway. She
          disrobes down to bare back...
          And from this darkness, the RED tip of a burning cigarette GLOWS
          into view. Hancock watches from here, the cigarette BLAZES back
          towards his face intense.

          They pass below us as we soar through air and mist...
          the mist clears, thrusting us into the dense foliage of a
          JUNGLE. We penetrate the silence
          the silence, it fades into SONG - the silk, mellifluous
          voice of a woman (not unlike Mary's). Her siren call beckons
          us... takes us deeper into unknown greenery...
          but the sound of crackling GUNSHOTS punctuate the end to
          song. SCREAMS and CRIES rise from the smoke, women and children
          in hysterics...

          Rocket and mortar shells EXPLODE in our path, splitting trees
          and earth...
          . we remain undaunted... but the WAILS of suffering
          continues...
          until we get there, there in a clearing as smoke and debris

          Hancock bolts from his bed - horrified, eyes cracked with red

          The orgasmic SCREAMS of a prostitute seeps through from the

          Consciousness slowly sinks in. He checks his watch, then the

          Horns seems lost in his own blank stare.

          A deserted street at this early hour. On the curb and by
          themselves - Horus and Roheim, ruminating.

          ROHEIM
          . that look on her face, you know the
          look, when she's almost there... makes
          you feel like a man.

          Then everything gets blurry and all of a
          sudden, it's not my arm that's around her
          and it's not my hand that's touching her
          and it's not even me, my body. Some guy,
          this good-looking guy... he looks like
          the Marlboro Man, only shirtless. And
          so... the Marlboro Man's running his
          fingers through her hair. And he's...
          banging her... and her knees... by her
          ears, you know?
          (beat; cringing)
          And that look on her face. That look.

          Mary and Aaron - they exit, surprising Clyde.
          Mary gestures at Clyde, pointing an accusing finger. She seizes

          Not a word. Just take it... you take

          No.

          ROHEIM
          You're afraid to offend. You don't want
          to be abrasive. Provocative.

          So you suppress. Do nothing. Take it.
          Roheim takes another gulp.

          You shouldn't drink.

          He crosses. the street, failing to look both ways... BAH! A UPS
          truck STRIKES the clueless superhero, sending him across air -
          towards Mary.

          Hancock warbles out from the debris - his trenchcoat reduced to
          mere tatters. He pulls a severed SLEEVE from the rubble. Looks
          at Mary, reposed before him.

          HANCOCK

          How are you?

          Mr. Longfellow rounds the corner and ambles home. He is tired

          There to make it worse - Clyde. He's back, getting at the sports
          page on the front steps.
          A sudden burst of outrage consumes Horus. He approaches the

          Along a street somewhere who cares - Hancock and Mary - in a
          cool stroll. Mary holds his trenchcoat, surveying the damage.

          MARY
          What were you doing in the street?
          (the trenchcoat)
          You ripped it pretty good.

          HANCOCK
          didn't see it coming... left myself

          It'll be all right.

          HANCOCK
          All right?

          MARY
          It's just the seams. I can sew it back.

          HANCOCK
          What?

          MARY
          (the trenchcoat)
          This. It's just the seams.'I'll take good
          care of it.

          HANCOCK
          You'll sew -it?

          MARY
          Yes. Me. I can. And I'll re-button it for
          you, all right?
          Hancock acknowledges with a smile - a slight one.

          MARY (CONT' D)

          (CONTINUING}

          Mary stands alone on the sidewalk, looking up at heaven. Her
          eyes search the gray sky for signs of life.-
          There, overhead - a DOT. It grows in size, getting closer and
          arriving fast... and gradually, it shapes into Hancock.

          

          

          

          

          65.
          He swoops into view, straight downward. Pulls on the air brakes
          and eases into a soft landing - by Mary's side.
          He is wet from his flight and his hands, 'we notice, are cupped
          together tightly.

          MARY
          (like a little girl)
          Let's see.

          HANCOCK
          You have to be quick.

          MARY
          Come on, I want to see.

          HANCOCK
          If you blink, you'll miss it.
          Hancock uncups his hands, releasing a billowy MASS of white
          something - it hangs in the air, and then dissipates into
          moisture. It showers into his open hands.
          Mary reaches for it. Too late.

          MARY
          I saw it, right? A little cloud.
          She peers into his hands - where only a pool of wetness remains.
          And with her fingers, Mary reaches inside to feel the rain.
          Hancock watches this - the innocence in her face, as her hand
          touches his.
          He stares down at her hand... at the wedding ring. Mary-pulls
          her hand away.

          MARY (CONY' D)
          The water is dirty.

          HANCOCK

          MARY

          HANCOCK
          I'm sorry.

          MARY
          (into his eyes)
          It's not your fault.

          

          

          

          

          66.
          Hancock looks away.

          MARY (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          You're tense.

          HANCOCK
          I've been tired, lately.

          MARY
          You should slow down. Rest.

          HANCOCK
          -So people tell me.

          MARY
          (heat; upon some thought)
          It must be hard.

          HANCOCK
          Hard?

          MARY
          To always do right... do good when all
          you want to do is rest.

          HANCOCK
          It's harder to not do anything. What am
          I? It's not for me. It's for... it is
          about people. Rest? When there is
          despair? I cannot. I bring relief. I am
          relief. You know that instant, that split
          instant of time when you realize that the
          nightmare... the totality of fear
          itself... that it's all been a bad dream?
          That it's safe? That is relief. The
          infant in my arms... to the hysterical
          mother. When you can see her face, what's
          rest? It is self-indulgence.
          Mary - in some advance stage of "wow."

          MARY
          Where... who are you?

          HANCOCK
          It's not important who I am, Mary. Or
          what... where I'm from. It doesn't
          matter. I'm a man. I am every man.

          

          

          

          

          67.

          MARY
          (sizing up his words)
          You probably get a lot of practice
          explaining yourself, on account of who
          you are and what you do.

          HANCOCK
          Why... do you say that?

          MARY
          It's like, everything you say sounds...
          so perfect. Like you rehearse them so
          they'll be that way. I mean, not to say
          that it's insincere...

          (BEAT)
          I mean, maybe it's something about you
          but... it must be hard on you sometimes.
          Hancock stares at his feet, perhaps reluctant to answer.

          MARY (CONT' D)

          (APOLOGETIC)
          But probably not... probably..

          HANCOCK
          Yes...
          (pulling teeth)
          sometimes.
          Mary allows the moment to sink in.

          MARY
          So, you never answered. Back there...
          what were you doing in the middle of the
          street?

          HANCOCK

          (THINKS)
          I was lost...

          (EXHALES)
          . but I think I'm ok, now.

          this before - Aaron, running for his life and the bullies in
          pell-mell pursuit.
          He cuts into an alley. Looses them momentarily. Finds a DUMPSTER

          Perceval strolls after them, too cool to sweat.
          From the dumpster, little Aaron watches them... looks
          relieved... until conscience kicks in. A moment to reflect, he
          takes.

          AARON

          " before long, you're running, looking
          for a place to hide."

          EXT. ALLEY - DAY

          Erlick and Spengler - at a dead end. Their trail leads them to a
          metal FENCE, the alley continuing beyond it. No time wasted
          they scale it.
          Perceval arrives - in time to see Erlick, landing on the other
          side. Spengler pulls himself over. Joins Erlick on the ground.

          PERCEVAL
          Shit, I'm not climbing this. Just combed
          my hair.
          Erlick and Spengler turn to him, through the metal bars. Their
          eyes are of disbelief.

          PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
          What's up?
          (checks his hair)
          What?
          Perceval follows their gaze behind him to Aaron, shivering
          with clenched fists.

          PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
          (rolls up sleeves)
          I just combed my hair.
          Erlick and Spengler make for the fence, to join the fray.

          PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
          Don't bother. He's mine.
          (to Aaron)
          No biting. I hate biting.

          SPENGLER
          Kick his ass, Percy.

          ERLICK

          (OVERLAPPING)
          Do him, Percy. He's your woman.

          

          

          

          

          69.

          PERCEVAL
          Let's go. Let's have it. While we're
          still kids.
          Nothing from Aaron - just a lot of balls.

          PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
          Dick wad, let's go. Come on, you impotent
          little gonad.

          (BEAT)
          Your mother chokes on big, hard, veiny,
          purple-headed shlongs the size of...
          All Aaron needs to hear. He charges - comatose.
          And the pummeling begins. Perceval dictates the assault, landing
          BLOWS to the face and body.
          Aaron - doing an impression of a punching bag. He wafts at air,
          left and right...

          ERLICK
          He's yours.

          SPENGLER
          Save some for us.
          Someone blinks - and Aaron finds himself on the dirt, supine.
          Perceval looms over him, silhouetted against the sky.
          He reaches for his zipper, doing that Perceval-thing. A look of
          recognition in Aaron's eyes - it's going to rain soon.
          He reacts with knee-jerk reflects, administering a swift kick
          into Perceval's peeing apparatus. A faint SQUEAL eructs from the
          fellow's mouth. He drops like a wet tea bag.
          Erlick. Spengler. Shock. Disbelief. Aaron gets to his feet,
          ready to book... but he doesn't. He stays.

          ERLICK
          What's he doing?

          SPENGLER
          Kick his ass, Percy.
          Aaron stares at them, behind the fence. Then down at Perceval
          fetal position, mouth agape. Aaron reaches for his zipper ZIP,
          revenge presents itself.

          ERLICK
          That's cold.

          

          

          

          

          ?0.

          SPENGLER
          Kill him, Percy.
          Aaron cranes himself over Perceval's face, over his open oral
          orifice. Contemplates his target.
          Aaron - to pee or not to pee...
          ZIP. He closes his fly. Steps away.

          AARON
          (to the boys)
          Don't mess with me.
          He struts out of the alley. Shifts into a mad sprint, adrenaline
          taking him away.

          CUT TO:

          INT. BEDROOM - DAY

          Horus sleeps. Mary enters from the hallway, hush-hush. She moves
          to the closet. Changes out of her clothes.
          Not a stir from Horus - exercising stealth in his efforts to
          watch her, watching her sweater fall to the carpet.
          Mary stands before the closet mirror. Does a profile check. She
          reaches for her bra... and from the mirror, catches Horus
          staring,.

          MARY
          You're still up?
          She moves behind the bathroom door. Self-conscious.

          HORUS
          Just get in?
          Mary steps out of the bathroom, buttoning up her domestic
          attire. She nods affirmatively.

          MARY
          Nick's market. Are you sick?

          HORUS
          I can't sleep.
          She goes to the bed. Palms his forehead with her right. Palms
          her own with the left, as reference.
          Horus tilts his head away from her hand.

          

          

          

          

          71.

          HORUS (CONT'D)
          Please, Mary.

          MARY
          You want some milk? I'll heat it up for
          you, how about that?

          HORUS
          No thank you.

          (BEAT)
          Aaron, today? This Hancock 's picking up

          MARY
          Yes, he is.
          He sits there in bed, struggling with the words. Mary continues
          dressing - oblivious.

          HORUS
          He'll take him home?

          MARY
          Yes.

          HORUS
          What do we know about this man? The
          papers... they don't have all the facts
          about him.

          MARY
          What facts? He's not a hero.

          HORUS
          Yes. A hero. I know that...

          MARY
          Aaron likes him.

          HORUS

          (TIMID)
          I know that maybe, I've been
          neglectful... that I haven't been
          there...
          Mary does not hear him. She's at the mirror, fixing her hair.

          HORUS (CONT' D)

          (SERIOUSLY)
          I'm trying... you have to know... I'd
          like to be more... involved. Like it used
          to be. Before we moved here.

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          72.

          HORUS (CONT' D)
          (notices Mary, applying

          LIPSTICK)
          Are you going somewhere?

          MARY
          No. I have to start on dinner. So how
          about that glass of milk?
          Horus - shakes his head, annoyed.

          MARY (CONT' D)
          All right. Try to get some sleep.
          With that, she's out the door.
          Horns alone in bed, staring into the vanity mirror at his
          wretched face.
          He spots a brown paper BAG on the chair. Goes to inspect. Inside
          - Hancock's tattered trenchcoat. Oy, what does it mean?
          Horus returns to bed, distraught. He buries himself under the
          cover.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Aaron races down the. last leg of his street. On the steps of his
          apartment building - Hancock, making himself at home. Yes, a
          cigarette smolders from his lips..
          Hancock looks at the boy. They share a second of silence.
          And finally, Hancock-puts out his hand - he approves. Aaron,
          triumphant, SMACKS it for five.

          CUT TO:

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          The dinner table. Post meal. Mid-digestion. Aaron is running off
          at the mouth.

          AARON
          .o his mouth was. open and he just stared
          up at me, it hurt that bad.
          And while he narrates, Mary runs her fingers through his hair -
          a mother grooming her child. Meanwhile, Horus listens concerned.

          AARON (CONTD.)

          (CONTINUING)
          I said, "don't mess with me." Just like
          that.

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          73.

          AARON (CONT'D)
          "Don't mess with me." Mom, remember that
          guy in the cop movie... he said that?

          MARY
          All right, already. How's your mouth?

          AARON
          It doesn't hurt, I told you.

          (CONTINUING)
          He saw everything from the roof. Said I
          did what I had to do.

          HORUS

          (FINALLY)
          Aaron, tomorrow...

          AARON
          (to Mary; oblivious)
          He said tomorrow, he'd pi ck me up
          again...

          HORUS
          I thought maybe you'd like it -- if I
          pick you.

          AARON
          God, my friends will freak.
          Horus freezes - fades back to his meal, unheard.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Through the dim of light - Horus, alone, prepares for work.
          A framed PHOTOGRAPH of a distinguished MAN (50's) sits on the
          shelf inside the closet - he poses in full police regalia, stern
          and proud.
          Horus pauses to acknowledge the photograph. He closes the closet
          door.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          On the kitchen floor and under the light - Mary and Aaron,
          mother giving son a HAIRCUT.

          MARY
          Hold still.

          AARON
          I like it long.

          MARY
          Shut up.

          

          

          

          

          74.
          Horus walks into the living room,. in the dark. He looks at his
          wife, then at his son - doing their own thing. They don't
          realize he's there.
          Horus leaves, the door'CLICKS shut behind him.

          MARY (CONT'D)
          Horus?

          AARON
          it's almost eight. Dad's late.

          MARY
          Horus?
          She brushes hair off her apron. Moves into the living room, the
          bedroom - no husband. She goes to the front door. Opens it into
          the stairway outside.
          There on the stairs and down below, Hancock stands - on his way
          up. Mary sees him... and they look at each other.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          In the kitchen and under the light, Mary. Hancock. Aaron. Mary
          is finishing up on Aaron, applying the last SNIP.

          AARON
          like this?
          (holds up hand)
          How do you make a fist?

          MARY
          (grabs his head)
          Aaron, hold it.
          Hancock shoves his fist up close, almost between the boy's eyes.
          So there it is, the fist - this petrified mass of knuckles and
          bones. It SNARLS at Aaron.
          Hancock holds it there, fingers locked together - like he can't
          let go of them.
          Aaron swallows - in awe. Mary watches her guest, the change in
          him.

          MARY (CONT'D)
          Hancock?
          The sound of her voice takes him. He snaps out of it.

          

          

          

          

          15.

          MARY (CONY' D)

          (CONTINUING
          ) turn. Hancock, it's yo ur

          HANCOCK
          What?

          MARY
          Your hair. Come on, have a seat.

          AARON
          Mom's going butcher your hair.

          MARY
          Shut up, kid. Hit the showers. And the n
          homework.

          AARON
          Oh, mom. I want to talk to him. Tell her,
          Hancock.
          Hancock shrugs a "what can I do."

          AARON (CONT' D)
          Yeah, right. I know. I got to do what I
          got to do.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          The Big Haircut. Mary and Hancock - up close. Mary runs her
          fingers through his hair, testing his length. She leans into
          him. SNIP, goes her scissor.
          Hancock - in his seat, as hard as marble. He seems a bit lost in
          her presence. Baffled.
          From his position, the view consists of Mary - blossoming in her
          sweater.
          And that's it. Not a word during this process - just the SOUND
          of their breaths.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Hancock.
          Erected before us, the immediate product of a mediocre haircut -
          he looks plain and un-super. He looks... goofy.

          MARY
          There... my hero.
          He inspects himself via a hand MIRROR. Smiles. Politely.

          

          

          

          

          76.

          MARY (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          How do you like it?

          HANCOCK
          Nice. Thank you.
          Mary - peripatetic, putting away things...

          MARY
          I started out just trimming for Horus.
          Here and there. He had to look just right
          for the academy, says his father, a
          police captain there... in Philly. When
          we moved here, I pretty much took over as
          the resident barber. You know, to save
          some money.

          HANCOCK
          He was in the-police academy?
          A pause.

          MARY
          His father's idea. Not his. He went
          through it anyway, like he had something
          to prove... the validation of his
          manhood.

          (BEAT)
          It tpok everything out of him. He didn't
          talk for days after he was cut. He took
          it real hard. I mean, still, he's not...
          I mean,, he's still...
          (edits herself)
          .it was a difficult time for hi.. Me. I
          understand that I'm not intolerant of it,
          the working-through process. It's just
          that, sometimes...
          (at Hancock)
          sometimes, I need his strength. I
          miss. the strength.

          HANCOCK
          Is that what you want?

          MARY
          Want?

          HANCOCK
          What you need?

          MARY
          The hair... I need to...

          

          

          

          

          77.
          She kneels to sweep up hair. Hancock follows her down.

          HANCOCK
          Mary?

          MARY
          Yes?

          HANCOCK

          (BEAT)
          You ever been down the boardwalk, at
          night?

          MARY
          Why... what for?
          They're eye to eye. Close.

          AARON (O.S.)
          Mom?
          Mary bursts from her perch - regroups, awkwardly. Aaron stands
          in the hallway, his hair still wet from the shower.

          MARY
          Yes.
          Inside Aaron's head: My mother + Hancock? Nah!

          AARON
          my mouth. It's starting to swell. I
          think he loosened a tooth.
          Mary - maternal duty calls.

          MARY
          All right. Go to your room. I'll get the
          ice pack.
          Aaron exits. Mary exits.
          Hancock - alone and on his knees. He finally rises. Heads for
          the front door.
          Mary returns with the ice pack. Catches him...

          MARY (CONT' D)
          You're leaving?

          HANCOCK
          It's getting late.

          

          

          

          

          78.

          MARY
          I'm sorry.

          HANCOCK
          I'm going to take a walk.

          MARY
          Really? On the boardwalk?

          HANCOCK
          Maybe.
          Pause.

           AARON (O.S.)
          Mom.'

           MARY
          I'm sorry.
          She goes to him, without words to say. In this silence, he
          stares at her his eyes, glazed with thought.

          HANCOCK

          (FINALLY)
          Good night, Mary.

          MARY
          Good night.

          INT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - NIGHT

          The clock - 9:45 pm.
          The store rests in afterhour stillness. Horus paces by the side
          door, his ears pressed to the phone receiver - no answer.
          He hangs up. Checks his watch. Goes to the front entrance and
          peers out at the street - no Roheim.

          INT. BAR - NIGHT

          The bar. The smoke. The scums of humanity. Gina - over there,
          marketing her cleavage to anything with a pulse and a penis.
          She mingles with a BAR FLY.
          Her eyes locate Hancock - entering, finding a seat.
          From an adjacent stool, A MAN places his hand on Hancock's lap.
          Whispers to him.

          

          

          

          

          79.

          MAN
          I wear dresses. How about you?

          HANCOCK
          (considers; nah)
          Get lost.
          The warning comes across quite well - the man exits.
          Gina saunters over - takes the vacancy. At the other end, the
          bar fly rises. Pays. Heads pass them, for the door.

          GINA
          (to bar fly)
          Meet you outside. The El Camino, right?
          The bar fly nods. Exits. Gina turns to Hancock. Takes his face
          in her hands, studies him.

          GINA (CONT'D)
          Your eyes are calm. It's good.
          She withdraws her hands.

          HANCOCK
          What?

          GINA
          But you're still here.
          She rises. And as she makes for the exit...

          GINA (CONT'D)
          Nice haircut.
          Hancock watches as the night swallows her whole. He inhales the
          rest of his cigarette - pensive.

           INT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - NIGHT

          The clock, it reads 1:05 am.
          Horns, his flashlight, they're making their rounds. His routine
          takes him outside - via an EXIT door.

          EXT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - NIGHT

          A dark alley. Dumpsters. Boxes.
          Horus peruses the premises. Heads around the building and to the
          street.:.

          been drinking, right?

          HORUS
          Dear God.
          Horus catches him.

          INT. WATANABE'S - NIGHT

          They find a chair in the back, Horus Positioning Roheim in the
          light. The old man isn't drunk - his mouth agape, his face
          bruised with wounds from a serious pummeling.
          A chunk of lip dangles, bleeds.

          HORUS
          Jesus.
          Goes to the bathroom sink for some paper towels. Comes back to
          nurse' the wounds.

          ROHEIM
          Figured I can get you by the front... but
          you weren't there.

          HORUS
          (dabbing the torn lip)
          Who... what happened?

          ROHEIM
          They-jumped me. That bastard Scarpo and
          his boys. They were waiting on me.
          Returns to get more clean towels. And comes back.

          HORUS
          Why didn't you come through the back...
          standing out there in the dark?

          ROHEIM
          -Couldn't find my keys. Must've dropped
          them'in the fight.
          (feels his lip)
          Shit...
          He works himself off the chair. Heads inside the bathroom.

          HORUS
          What're you doing?

          

          

          

          

          81.

          ROHEIM
          (into the mirror)
          the old man
          Look at what they did.. gave
          a fat lip to match his big mouth. I'm for
          shit.

          HORUS

          (FRUSTRATION)
          Sit down
          Could you knock it off, please.
          so I can clean the cuts.
          He leads the old wretch back to the chair.

          ROHEIM
          I'm a waste of time...

          HORUS
          Stop.

          ROHEIM
          I'm too old for this.

          HORUS
          You're not old.

          ROHEIM
          What am I... I'm biologically challenged.
          Any way you look, I'm a waste of effort.

          (BEAT)

          I
           Use to be, I blame the job. The job.
           think, bullshit job. Not right for a man.
           "To observe and record..." I say, what a t's for
           the hell is DIo nly

           reason we're he d re, we don't shit on the
          carpet.
          Horus looks away. Doesn't want to hear it.

          ROHEIM (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          But you know what, Horus. That's all
          wrong. It ain't the job. The job don't
          make the man. It's me. Not the uniform.
          It starts right here... 'cause I can't do
          anything right. Fuck up my ABC's.
          (a beat; at Horus)
          But you. Why do you put up with this
          crap? A wife. A kid. There... waiting for
          you at home.
          Horus - he just doesn't know anymore.

          EXT. KILLYBEGS TEXTILES - NIGHT

          On the rooftop of this building - Hancock, on another end of a
          Marlboro. Eyes red. Hair in wet dishevelment. He's a mess.

          HANCOCK
          got to do what you got to do.
          He paces with nervous energy, pounding his fist into the other
          hand. We sense a decision brewing...

          INT. THE LONGFELLOW BEDROOM - NIGHT

          A desk clock points to 2:30 am.
          Mary - awake undercover. She twists, turns...
          A shadow engulfs the side of her wall, smothering the light in
          the room. Mary catches it. Rises above her blanket.
          What she sees - outside the window, Hancock hanging there in non-
          gravity. He stares directly at her.

          HANCOCK
          I know you're up, Mary. I know you can
          hear me. Please meet me on the boardwalk
          tomorrow morning. Nine o'clock. It's
          important that I talk to y ou, then.

          (GRAVELY)
          Please, Mary.
          And with that, he's off and away. Mary.- stunned.

          INT. ROHEIM'S APARTMENT - DAY

          We're in the staircase - where Horus is, supporting Roheim up
          the stairs.

          ROHEIM
          They're going to can me.

          HORUS
          No one's canning anyone. No one saw us...
          watch your step... leave.

          ROHEIM
          Should be an extra key over the door.

          INT. KITCHEN - DAY

          In the kitchen, Mary and Aaron - the morning routine. Something
          is off this morning, like someone threw a wrench into the
          machinery.
          Mary appears a bit frazzled, handing her son toasts. She rushes
          back to the stove - her eggs beckoning.

          AARON
          The toast's burnt.

          MARY
          What?
          Aaron inspects his Superman lunchbox.

          AARON
          We're late... you forgot the corn chips.
          Mary serves up-the eggs - sunny side up. 1. and down... and all
          over the place.

          MARY
          Eat... and we'll go.
          (checks her watch)
          Where's your father?
          She grabs a comb and proceeds to part Aaron's hair.

          AARON
          You forgot the corn...
          (the comb snags)
          . ouch!

          MARY
          I'm'sorry, honey. I was hoping daddy'll
          be home before we leave. I'm sorry.

          AARON
          You having your period, mom?
          She responds with a brisk slap to the head... SMACK.

          INT. ROHEIM'S APARTMENT - DAY

          We enter an anal-retentively neat and manicured living room.
          Horus ushers Roheim in...

          ROHEIM
          Shoes.
          The two pause. Remove their shoes. Proceed into bedroom.

          INT. BEDROOM - DAY

          Horus sets Roheim down on the bed. Tucks him under.

          HORUS
          You're going to be okay?

          ROHEIM
          I don't know. You might have solo act
          tomorrow night.

          HORUS
          Get some sleep.

          ROHEIM
          You're a good man, Horus.

          HORUS
          (washing over it)
          I have to get home, now. I'll call.
          Roheim grabs on to his sleeve.

          ROHEIM
          You know what Olga said before she walked
          out on me? Her last words to me. She
          turned at the front door. Looked around
          the room and she says, "keep it clean."
          That's it, can you believe it? Then out
          the door.

          (BEAT)
          But like a.shmuck,.I keep the place
          spotless... in case she walks through
          that door one day.
          (at Horus; with pain)
          I don't think she's coming back.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Horus struggles homeward - his mind in a headlock with anger,
          despair, a combination thereof.
          He moves down his street. Looks ahead - where Clyde stands,
          pillaging his morning paper. Clyde Spots Horus on the approach.
          Smiles at him, with impunity. Goes back in.
          On Horus - you can boil an egg in his seething mouth.

          INT. APARTMENT - DAY

          Fist clenched, the morning paper under his arm - Horus. steadies
          down the hallway. His eyes target the door at the end of the hall, seeing red.

          

          

          

          

          85.
          He gets there, the door. He swallows. Wipes sweat off his hand.
          KNOCK. And again, KNOCK.
          ï¿½ow
          He fidgets in his spot - courage evaporating with every elapsed
          second. Until finally, Horus is a pile of dung.
          The door opens.
          And Clyde emerges, tall and ugly. He's holding up his pants with
          one and the SPORTS PAGE with the other.
          Caughtin mid-defecation, he is none too happy.

          CLYDE
          The box scores are waiting and I got an
          inch of meat sticking out of my ass. Make
          it snappy.

          HORUS
          (loosing his voice)
          I'd like my sports page, please.

          CLYDE
          You what?

          HORUS
          I want you to stop taking my sports page.

          CLYDE
          All right.
          Clyde closes the door. Horus - thunderstruck.
          He stutter-steps... KNOCKS...

           CLYDE (CONT' D)

           (AGITATED)
           What's the matter, you deaf? I'll stop
           taking your sports page. Now get out of
          here and let me...

          HORUS

          (INTERRUPTS)
          I want today's sports page.

          CLYDE
          You what?

          HORUS
          That there... my sports page.

          

          

          

          

          86.

          CLYDE
          What's gotten in to you? All of a sudden?
          You don't even like football.
          Horus does.not budge.

          CLYDE (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          You'll get it back... after I take my
          dump.
          Clyde proceeds to close the door... but Horus interjects, his
          foot in the door.

          HORUS
          No.

          CLYDE
          What?

          HORUS
          No. I would like my sports page now.
          Please.

          CLYDE
          After I finish.

          HORUS
          I'd prefer it now.

          CLYDE
          What's eating you, Longfella? You crazy?
          Without warning, Horus wrests the sports page from Clyde's arm
          a kamikaze move, indeed.

          CLYDE (CONT'D)

          (SHOCKED)
          Give that back.
          Horns lunges at his hulking opponent, lands a punch into Clyde's
          midsection. Harmless - it tickles him, maybe.

          CLYDE (CONT'D)
          Why'd you go and do that for?
          Clyde belts up has pants. Roles up his sleeves.., and the
          massacre commences.
          He simply tears into Horus... SLOWS to the stomach... RIGHTS
          across the face. It ends quickly and without resistance - as if
          Horns accepted it as fate.

          

          

          

          

          87.
          Clyde 'kneels over. Picks up the sports page. And as if yawning,
          returns to his room.

          EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

          By the fence - Mary and Aaron.
          Mary, with a brown paper BAG, seems.distant, preoccupied in a
          far away place.

          AARON
          Are you all right, mom?

          MARY

          (DISTRACTED)
          Yeah... why?

          I'm late for class. Go home, mom. I think

          Aaron leaves.
          Pensive, Mary begins her walk... to the boardwalk.

          INT. APARTMENT - DAY

          The door swings open to admit Horus - battered, enraged,
          disoriented. He confronts an empty apartment.

          HORUS
          Mary!
          A deaf ear. No one's there to console him. He storms out of the
          apartment.

          EXT. BOARDWALK - DAY

          The ocean RAGES against the shore, in the distance and at some
          muffled volume.
          Up against the railing leans Hancock, and the remains of a
          cigarette. His hair drips of salt water - he's been here a
          while, one would suspect.

          follows suit, passing by.

          COP (CONT'D)

           Hancock - his gaze wavers not from the distant waters.

          EXT..STREET - DAY

           Horus stumbles. Keeps his balance. Trudges down the street to a
          corner BAR.

          INT. BAR - DAY

          The bar is empty at this hour. The chairs are up, the floor
          swept. A husky BARTENDER unloads liquor in the back.
          Horus enters. Finds a stool.

          HORUS
          Drink.
          The bartender comes out, considers this man's appearance.

          EXT. BOARDWALK - DAY

          Mary stands there on the boardwalk, the bag in her arms.
          It's cold this morning. A little wind has picked up. And the
          clouds - they're alive, restless.
          She finds Hancock, staring at her, waiting for. her.

          HANCOCK

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)
          (at the clouds)
          They're moving. The turbulence has
          started.

          Tell me what's wrong.
          He points to the distant ocean - where the horizon curves into
          darkness.

          HANCOCK
          Look out there and what do you see, Mary?

          MARY

          (PERPLEXED)
          Nothing. I don't know... I don't see
          anything.

          Y nu?
          (beat; holding on to a thread)
          And that's good, not seeing. But for me,
          I've seen it. It's where I'm from... out
          there.

          But I don't ask, "why me?" I don't
          question it. This is me. I'm it. I do
          what I have to do. I get in there.., all
          the killing... the blood... and I deal
          with it. I clean up. I make things right.

          (BEAT)
          And. But when.., where does it end?
          (re: his cape)
          Can't stop the hemorrhage... it's
          everywhere. And it stays. All that I can
          do, Mary. The things I am capable of
          doing, I can't blink away the hell I've
          seen. It's in me...
          (points to his head)
          in here and I can't not think about
          it. It's in me. It's me.

          MARY
          Hancock... what...

          HANCOCK
          I just want to let go, Mary. Or I'll
          break. I need to get away. Get away to
          where? I don't know.
          (at Mary)
          I need your help.

          MARY
          Me? What can I do?
          (she's helpless)
          What do you want me to do?

          HANCOCK
          I want you to save me.

          MARY
          How?
          Hancock leans forward. Towards Mary. And kisses her.
          Their lips lock, twisted and entwined... until Mary, composing
          her senses, pulls away.

          MARY (CONT'D)
          Don ' t.

          

          

          

          

          91.

          HANCOCK

          (DESPERATE)
          Save me.

          MARY
          I can't.

          HANCOCK
          You can.
          (the hard sell)

          AND
          Mary,-I'll take you away. And Aaron.
          what... I'll quit. Get a real job. An
          apartment. I'll flip burgers. I don't
          know what I'm doing... what I'm saying
          anymore.

          MARY

          (OVERLAPPING)
          I'm married.
          A pause.

          HANCOCK
          To whom?

          MARY
          I love him.
          The death blow.

          HANCOCK
          No.
          (turns from her)
          Unacceptable.

          MARY
          I love him. I'm sorry.
          One can almost hear life's precious air seeping out of this
          superman - he'd slump over if not for the muscles of steel.
          Mary wants to console... but what can she do?

          HANCOCK
          I'm cold.
          Mary hands him the contents of the bag - the trenchcoat.

          MARY
          I'm sorry.

          

          

          

          

          92.
          She leaves.

          CUT TO:

          INT. BRADLEY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

          Aaron. The school hallway. He holds a wooden hall PASS,
          indicating that class is in session.
          He swings into the BOYS ROOM.

          INT. BOYS ROOM - DAY

          A large restroom - empty. Little Aaron passes up on the urinals.
          Selects a private STALL. ZIP - urination begins.
          Splash segues into drip. DRIP. Aaron shakes off the last drop...

          PLOP.
          And that's the cue for the adjacent stalls - arms like tentacles
          surface from below, shackling Aaron in his spot. He can't see
          but, from behind, the stall door opens...
          Guess who?
          Perceval - possessed. He grabs the back of Aaron's head.
          Introduces it to the yellowed waters below.
          SPLASH - the head goes in, submerged. What Aaron sees for the
          next several seconds: yellow, the thrashing of.bubbles, the
          shine.-of white porcelain at.intimate range.
          What he hears: the GASPING of his own breath, GURGLE, and wicked
          laughter.
          The ambush ends. Perceval. Erlick. Spengler. One of them says...

          THEM

          (MOCKINGLY)
          "Don't mess with me."
          They leave - laughing.

          THEM (CONT'D)
          (in the distant)
          Little shit.
          Left there and in the stall - Aaron, slumped against the bowl.
          On the tile floor. A wet rag of piss.

          

          

          

          

          93.

          INT. APARTMENT - DAY

          Mary hurries into the room - flustered, adrenaline coursing
          wild.
          She runs down the hallway to her bedroom, seeking solace in
          Horns. The cold, empty bed says he hasn't been home.

          MARY
          Horus...

          CUT TO:

          EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

          The school front. KIDS swarm into the streets, freshly released
          from captivity. And there amidst bedlam - Aaron, roughed-up and
          soiled in disgrace.
          He moves to the curb, waiting for someone to take him away. No
          Hancock, anywhere.
          Aaron waits, hopeful.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Hancock walks an aimless walk - in oblivion, a WHISKEY BOTTLE in
          his hand. He's been drinking. L"i
          in his path and up ahead, a little girl SUE (8) beckons at the
          upper branches of a tree.

          SUE
          (so innocent, her voice)
          Hymie. Come down, Hymie.
          She catches Hancock, Mr..Superhero who can fly, stumbling by.

          SUE (CONT' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          Mister? My Hymie won't come down from the
          tree.
          Hancock's reaction - "what?"

          SUE (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          My pussycat. She won't come down.
          She stares up at him with big, blue, sad, helpless, innocent
          eyes.

          

          

          

          

          94.
          So cool, Hancock reaches down for a PEBBLE - takes it in his
          palm. Finds the little pussy named Hymie. And with a simple
          flick of the wrist... shoots it down.
          A sharp MEOW. punctuates the task. Hymie drops from the branch,
          limp and lifeless. A THUD we hear on impact.

          SUE (CONT'D)
          (so innocent, her voice)
          Holy fuck.
          Hancock resumes his course, taking off and into the wet sky.

          EXT. SKY - DAY

          Hancock's drunken flight - erratic and dangerously close to...
          BAM... buildings. He strikes the corner of a brick tower,
          plummeting downward with the dislocated debris.
          He bounces off the concrete -.in an alley.

          INT. APARTMENT - DAY

           Mary is on the sofa - wondering where Horus might be. She checks
          h er watch.

          EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

          The place is empty. Deserted.
          Aaron. On the curb. Some trash flutters by his feet. On his face
          - the abandonment of all hope. Nobody's coming, this is clear.

          EXT. ALLEY - DAY

          Hancock - on his back and amidst the rubble.
          He braces the building to get up. Drops. Gets to his feet, only
          to be confronted by the police officer from the boardwalk.
          We'll call this one officer REED - a beat cop with something
          stiff up his ass.

          REED
          What do we have here? A piece of shit.
          A slow look of recognition seizes his face - this is that
          superguy.
          Hancock stares at him.

          

          

          

          

          95.

          HANCOCK

          (HUMORLESS)
          Fuck off.
          He pushes past Reed, who acquieces willingly.

          EXT. STREET - DAY


          A
          Aaron. Walking home. Dejected. His eyes catch a glimpse of
          particular pedestrian down the street - Hancock. He gives
          chase... and confronts him, out of breath.

          AARON
          (a slight smile)
          Hi.

          HANCOCK
          (turning; drunk)
          What're you doing here?

          AARON
          (the smile fades)
          I saw you walking. Where were you today?
          You said you'd... be there.
          Hancock - looking over Aaron's abused frame.

          HANCOCK
          I don't know what you're talking about.

          AARON
          Where are you going? Can I go?

          HANCOCK
          You don't want to go where I'm going.

          AARON
          Those assholes got me in the bathroom,
          today...
          (trying to hold on)
          and you said you'd pick me up at
          school.
          Hancock turns. He's upset now.

          HANCOCK
          Listen.
          Aaron recoils.

          HANCOCK (CONY' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          Listen. I'm not here to save you.

          (MORE)

          96.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)
          No, not my job. Don't put that on me.
          (pounds his chest)
          Not my problem. Not on my shoulders. Deal
          with it, kid. You are what you are and...
          what I say, it won't do you any change.
          You'll grow up to be just like-your old
          man. A coward. Not a damn thing you can
          do about it... 'cept grab both ankles,
          hope by the grace of God the reaming's
          gentle.
          Aaron backs away from his angry wrath.

          HANCOCK (CONT' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          That's right. Walk away. Me... I'm not
          here to save you.
          He watches Aaron break 1into a run - another youngster dashed
          against the rocks.
          In Hancock's eyes - a .glint of regret. But only a glint.

          INT. BAR - DAY

          This empty bar.
          With the exception of Horus and the bartender - while he's
          drying some mugs, let's call him JOEY (30).

          HORUS

          (BOOZED)
          One.more.
          Joey studies him. He takes a mug and begins to fill it...

          HORUS (CONT'D)
          No... nevermind.
          (going to blow)
          Where's your bathroom?

          JOEY
          (not in my place)
          Bathroom's closed.
          Horus politely stands'- teeters a bit.

          HORUS
          How much.

           JOEY

          (SARCASM)
          Let's see... that's one beer. Tell you
          what. I'll take care of this one.

          

          

          

          

          97.

          HORUS
          Thank you.

          JOEY
          The register ain't open yet, anyhow.
          Horus doesn't hear him. He's already on the move, making a dash
          for the door. But too late - he VOMITS at the front entrance.

          JOEY (CONT'D)
          Shit.

          EXT. HADES - DAY

          In the armpit of town - Hancock. He lights a cigarette with the
          matchbook Gina had given him earlier.
          At attention before him - Gina, gnawing on gum, heaving in all
          her glory.

          GINA
          I've been waiting.
          They stare for one horny beat.
          Hancock moves into her. Buries his head into her bosoms, looking
          for solace. She takes him in, very maternal this Gina.

          \./

          INT. APARTMENT - DAY

          The front door opens, but slowly. Aaron steps inside.
          From the kitchen, Mary spots him in his violated condition. He
          sees her reaction, that of shock - and like that, he runs
          s obbing into her arms.

          CUT TO:

          EXT. HADES - DAY

          A phone booth - Gina's office.
          There in the back alley and in this glass booth - Hancock and
          Gina, their organs ensnared. They're pumping away. Up. Down.
          A surreal sight, indeed - the red of his cape and the black of
          her leather.

          GINA
          Come on, baby. Relax.

          HANCOCK
          I can't.

          

          

          

          

          98.

          GINA
          You can.
          The phone begins to RING - but they're busy.

          HANCOCK
          I can't.

          GINA
          Let it go, baby. Just let it...

          RING...

          HANCOCK
          (in tears)
          I can't.
          His arm rips through the glass...

          GINA
          . go.

          (ORGASMS)
          Oh god.

          HANCOCK
          I can't!

          RING...
          He DRILLS a hole into the phone - killing it.'

          GINA
          Don't give up, now.
          He lets her down. Tears out of the booth. Finds the sky.

          EXT. SHEEPSHEAD BAY - NIGHT

          There is movement in the sky above - aggressive formations and
          grooves in clouds once coy and demure. The wind HUMS its
          presence, toys with fallen leaves.

          'INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          It's dinner - but all is not well. Mary and Aaron and an empty
          chair. '
          They sit without talking.. They eat without making a sound.
          Between them - a ketchup bottle.
          The door bursts wide, coughing up Horus. He locates his chair
          and plops on it... misses... kisses the carpet.

          

          

          

          

          99.

          HORUS
          (on the ground; prone)
          Son. Go to your room.
          Struggles to his knees.

          MARY
          What happened toyou?

          AARON
          Dad, are you wasted?

          MARY
          Where... Aaron, he's not wasted. Go to
          your room.

          AARON
          He is wasted.
          Horus rises, under great difficulty. Feels his way to the sofa.
          When Mary tries to assist, he waves her away.

          HORUS
          Aaron. Go to your room.

          AARON
          But dad...

          MARY

          (AUTHORITY)
          Go!
          Aaron obliges, at reluctant pace.

          MARY (CONT' D)
          What do you think you're doing, Horus
          Longfellow?
          Horus gauges her.

          HORUS
          Don't "Horus Longfellow" me, Mary. I'm
          not your child. I'm your husband.

          MARY
          Horus, what're you talking about?
          (re: bruises)
          Who did this to your face?
          Horus rises from his seat with mustered strength.

          

          

          

          

          100.

          HORUS

          (OBLIVIOUS)
          But you didn't know-about me...
          Mary knows where this is headed.

          HORUS (CONT' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          You didn't know I was going to do this to
          you.
          (a half-chuckle)
          I guess I should've known. We were
          married and I knew... at the reception. I
          couldn't dance. so I sat in the back and
          watched. You were with Stuart Olmsted and
          I watched you dance. In your white dress.
          And I remember zoning out... for a
          second, just watching you. God, Mary...
          the little girl next door who used to get
          into fist fights with her brothers in
          those patched-up Toughskins. We met only
          'cause the tallest tree in the
          neighborhood was in my backyard and you
          needed to climb it.

          (BEAT)
          But that night. God, you looked so
          beautiful I.had to realize it... how much
          I loved you... one more time.

          (BEAT)
          You and Stuart danced. Laughed. And I
          remember I'm watching you there, with
          him... together like that. You looked
          good with him, I thought all of a sudden.
          Like you belong... better. And as I
          stared across the floor, it was the same
          story with all the guys there, that they
          were more right for you.

          (SWALLOWS)
          More right because that night, you walked
          in with the wrong man.

          MARY
          Why do you say that?

          HORUS
          Because I let you down.

          (BEAT)
          I'm a coward. I can't do anything about
          it. Look at me, I'm breaking up in front
          of you. And God, I fear the day when I'd

          We see a BOY, huddled under a table. Hancock wraps his cape
          around him. Bolts through the inferno... as glass SHATTERS...
          and gas pipes ERUPT.
          He takes the boy to safety. Unwraps the cape... only to see the

          She rises after him and into view - it's no other than the TV

          Scarpo - in full alert. He's heard the commotion upstairs.

          SCARPO
          Guys?
          (no answer)
          Fuck me.
          He drops his loot. Heads for the second floor, cocking his gun.

          INT. ELECTRONICS SECTION - THIRD FLOOR - NIGHT,

          Thug #1, he's writhing to music under the privacy of headphones -
          unaware of Horus behind him... Thug #1 whirls around with a gun,
          catching Horus off guard.
          Horus responds with a FLASH he had acquired from the camera
          section - the burst of light momentarily blinds the thug.
          And a quick SNAP of the bat takes out Thug #1. Horus dispenses
          of the camera, his adrenaline raging. He commandeers the free
          gun, heads downstairs.
          But the TV stops him... it displays the siege at Killybegs
          Textiles.

          REPORTER
          again, we believe that this is a
          hostage situation. Officials refuse to
          comment but we believe Hancock has
          abducted a woman, the identity of whom we
          do not yet know...
          Horus - a look of horror on his face.

          HORUS

          He's off, slowing to a ginger descent at the stairs. Makes his
          way down to the second floor... where he is greeted by a gun
          NOZZLE, pressed against his temple.

          SCARPO
          You're starting to piss me off.
          He pushes Horus down the remaining steps.

          INT. SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT

          Horus rolls to a halt. Scarpo greets him there...
          pulling him-up by the hair...

          Horus uncoils an accurate kick to Scarpo's groin.
          Scarpo - a dumbfounded look entwined in pain. He drops.
           Horus goes for the gun. A struggle ensues, Scarpo finding Horus to the side.

          Ted "the pissed-off police captain" Brock stands by his vehicle,
          screaming out orders - a BULL HORN in his hand.

          Come on out!
          Hancock seizes his ears the bull horn testing his nerves.
          He bolts upright, turns to Mary. He seeks a special kind of
          healing.
          Hancock closes in - corners her.

          MARY
          Please.
          But there's no denying this superman - he grabs her, running his
          hand down her back and between her buttocks.

          No...

          A sudden burst of anger seizes Mary. She SCREAMS... STRIKES
          Hancock across the face.

          MARY

          NO!
          He tears himself away. Disgusted. Tortured.

          Make it go away, Mary.
          Mary huddles against the wall..She watches on, watching him

          Maybe... if you knew that, that I know.
          And. That I won't expect anything from

          Hancock turns on this. Stares at her. He rises from the crouch.
          Mary - back to wall, on the defensive.
          He approaches. Stands before her.
          He reaches back... and removes his CAPE. He covers Mary, gently

          Horus storms into the room... in time to greet a police OFFICER,

          A machine GUN mounted inside opens FIRE - a wave of bullets
          ricochet off the superhero with no effect.
          Cops and S.W.A.T. teams continue their assault - it's the only
          thing they can do, and it's worthless.
          And on that note, Hancock retaliates - with a vengeance.
          First to go is the helicopter. He slices through the air and
          RIPS the vehicle in half.
          An EXPLOSION punctuates its demise - sending the spinning
          PROPELLER into wild trajectory. It crashes into a cluster of
          Cops - heads are severed, sent flying.

          mangled bodies.
          Satisfied - Hancock returns inside the building.
          From the street, we can SEE Horus - fumbling through the rubble,
          heading towards the confrontation. He'passes a mutilated body -
          belonging to Adams.
          A revolver dangles from his fingers. Horus reaches for the gun
          and stops. He looks around at the vast destruction and realizes
          that no revolver will do. He continues forth.

          Horns stands there in the rain - a feeble frame of a man. He
          wants a fight.
          And he gets it... as Hancock, once again, emerges from the
          building - fire in his eyes.

          HANCOCK
          You ready to rock it up?
          Horus runs - he runs for an overturned S.W.A.T. VAN. Hancock
          follows, toying with the man.
          Horus disappears inside.

          HANCOCK (CONT' D)
          Come out, you little shit.
          A pause in action - no reply from Horus.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)
          Are you a man?!
          Horus answers...
          He storms out with a ROCKET LAUNCHER.
          He FIRES it at the unsuspecting Hancock. It's a hit and it BLOWS
          Hancock against Killybegs Textile. It lodges him inside the
          brick structure.

          HORUS
          Fuck you.
          Hancock pries himself loose - enraged beyond imaginable. He
          GROWLS - looking to retaliate. But there's no Horus.
          Hancock explores the rubble - by the building. A sudden
          EXPLOSION rips the base of a nearby wall - it jars the wall
          loose, sending it crashing down.., on Hancock.
          CRUNCH, the concrete rips right pass Hancock - stuns but does
          not subdue him. He shakes off the dirt. Finds Horus down the
          street.
          Like a rocket, Hancock heads that way. He gets there, over Horus
          - grabbing him by the collar.
          With a swift flick, he sends the family man flying.
          THUD as his body careens off the Killybegs wall. He drops to the
          asphalt below. Horus - in pain, something broken possibly.

          He gets up. Tries to walk. Can't.
          Hancock - on the app roach, maintaining a cruel but steady pace
          towards his wounded game.
          Horns tries to crawl. Can't. Too much pain. He peddles back
          against the curb, nowhere left to go.
          Hancock arrives, looking afully steamed. He stands over Horus -
          not unlike Scarpo much
          The situation presents itself - he reacts.
          A kick into Hancock's groin muscle - CHINK, sliikeyt a soundWofshrugs.

          else can he do?

          this piece of jagged metal.

          No regrets.

          HANCOCK

          (COOL)
          No mercy.
          He takes aim...

          AARON (O.S.)

          NO!
          Mary SCREAMS in the background...
          Horns. Hancock. They turn to witness the de-physicalization of
          Killybegs Textile.
          they begin to crumble, weakened by the wear Bricks... beams...
          and tear of recent artillery.
          Mary braces herself as the floor beneath begins to give. It
          slips... she SCREAMS... and collapses, taking the rest of the
          building with it.
          A CRASH, followed by a cloud of billowing smoke.
          Mary is no more.

          HORUS

          Horus, he struggles to his feet. Pushes past Hancock, limping
          over to the building that once was.

          HORUS

          MARY!
          Hancock - not a word. He stands in comatose silence, looking
          pale.
          Horus charges the building in possessed hysterics, trying to
          excavate his wife - one brick at a time.
          Roheim meets him there, in an effort to console.

          ROHEIM (O.S.)
          (you're wasting your time)
          Come on, Horus.
          Horus - lost in the pain. He won't listen.
          Slowly and with a sense of duty, Roheim joins the excavation. He
          r olls up his sleeve and gets to work.
          Hancock drops the yield,sign. Turns to the battlefield in his
          midst... surveys the carnage...
          A loaded beat.
          Hancock ROARS - a cry of desperation. He grimaces with defeat.
          Staggers off. SCREAMS, because what else can he do. Falls to his
          knees... by a fallen police GUN.

          He picks it up...
          points it at his head...

           FIRES the remaining rounds against his temple. Bullets carom
          off skull.
          Hancock discards the gun. Breaks into TEARS. Long SOBBING wet
          tears. He CRIES. He WEEPS. Into his cupped hands. Indeed, a
          surreal sight.
          Horus. Roheim. Engaged to the task, brick by brick. Horus works
          his way down... to a lifeless ARM, protruding from its tomb.
          He stops.

          it's black, I'll see HIM.

          On the bed there - HIM... Horns.

          EXT. BEL AIR BAY CLUB -- PACIFIC PALISADES, CA -- MORNING

          It's a beautiful spring morning in the Palisades. High atop
          the cliffs, looking out over the Pacific Ocean, sits the
          exclusive BEL AIR BAY CLUB. Workers bustle about the lawn,
          setting up a high-end wedding.
          A STRING QUARTET warms up. A team of FLORISTS arrange
          centerpieces. CATERERS set the white linen tables...

          INT. BRIDAL SUITE -- DAY

          A simple, classic wedding dress hangs on a closet door in
          this sun-drenched bridal suite. Sitting at the makeup table,
          surrounded by her bridesmaids, is the beautiful bride, TRACY
          TURNER, 20's. She's busy doing her makeup.
          Just then, Tracy's rich, stern FATHER, 50's, blows in.

                              MR. TURNER
                    Any word from Doug?
          The way he spits out "Doug" tells us all we need to know
          about how Mr. Turner feels about his future son-in-law.

                              TRACY
                    No, but I'm sure he's--
          Just then, Tracy's CELLPHONE rings. She quickly answers it.

                              TRACY (CONT'D)
                    Hello?

                                                     INTERCUT WITH:

          EXT. MOJAVE DESERT -- MORNING

          Heat-waves rise off the Mojave. Standing at a lone, dust-
          covered payphone in the middle of the desert is

          VICK LENNON
          He's in his late 20's, tall, rugged -- and currently a mess.
          His shirt is ripped open, his aviator sunglasses are bent,
          his lip is bloodied, and he clearly hasn't slept in days.

                              VICK
                    Tracy, it's Vick.
          Parked on the dirt road behind Vick is his near-totalled 1967
          Cadillac Deville convertible; it's scratched, dented, filthy -
          - and missing its passenger side door.
          Slouched inside are TWO OTHER GUYS, also looking like hell.

          

                                                                      2.

          

          

                                TRACY
                    Hey Vick!

                              VICK
                    Listen, honey...The bachelor party
                    got a little out of control and,
                    well...we lost Doug.

                              TRACY
                        (her jaw dropping)
                    What?! But we're getting married in
                    like four hours!
          Vick squints at the rising sun.

                              VICK
                    Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

          EXT. THE 10 FREEWAY -- DAY

          The top down, The Who's "Baba O'Riley" blasting from the
          stereo, Vick's pristine Cadillac convertible rockets down
          Highway 10 towards Nevada.
          At the wheel is Vick, looking as sharp as his Caddy in a half-
          open shirt and mint condition aviators.
          Sitting shotgun is the groom, DOUG BILLINGS, late 20's,
          handsome, barefoot, crunchy -- an all around great guy.
          Behind Vick sits ALAN MERVISH, late 20's, an anal tax
          attorney from Connecticut, his Izod shirt tucked into his
          khakis. He's currently applying sun screen to his forehead.
          Next to Alan is STU PRYCE, late 20's, former high school
          linebacker and lovably dimwitted father of two. He drums the
          back of the frontseat to the music, totally pumped, like this
          is his first time out of the house in years. Because it is.

                              STU
                    Dude this is already the best
                    weekend ever!

                              VICK
                    Stu, relax, we're still on the 10.

          

                                                                      3.

          

          

                              STU
                    Oh, did I show you pictures of my
                    kids?!

                              DOUG
                    No, dude, show `em.
          Stu fishes pictures out of his wallet and eagerly shows them
          to Doug in the front seat. Doug is clearly the core of this
          group, the glue that holds these childhood friends together.

                              STU
                    Haylee is two, and Kaitlin is
                    already four! Can you believe it?!

                              DOUG
                        (smiling at photos)
                    How cute... Good for you, man.
          Doug shows the photos to Vick; he nods, impressed.

                              VICK
                    The one on the left is gonna be a
                    hottie. The other one, not so much.
          Stu protectively snatches the photos back, muttering:

                              STU
                    Jesus, dude, those are my children--

                              ALAN
                        (re: sunscreen)
                    Hey, am I rubbed in?
          Stu glances over and sees un-rubbed-in sunscreen all over
          Alan's face.

                              STU
                    Yeah, you're good.

                              DOUG
                    Hey so Alan, are you and Becky
                    still together?
          But before Alan can answer--

                              VICK
                    Of course they are, Doug. Jesus,
                    Alan's been dating Becky for 14
                    years. When they first met, Alan
                    had braces and soccer hair, and
                    Becky had a functioning hymen.

                              (MORE)

          

                                                                    4.

          

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Asking Alan if he's still with
                    Becky is like asking the sun if it
                    still rises in the east.
          The guys try not to laugh; Alan scowls.

                              DOUG
                    She still pressuring you to get
                    married?

                              ALAN
                    Enh, we've moved past the pressure
                    stage...it's more like aggravated
                    assault stage now? Like at the last
                    wedding we went to, she threw a
                    camera at my head, called me a
                    closet fag, then ran out crying.
          The guys wince, oooo.

                              ALAN (CONT'D)
                    But we talked, and everything's
                    cool now.

                              STU
                    Maybe you could wear a helmet to
                    Doug's wedding.

                              ALAN
                    Great idea, Stu. Thanks.

                              DOUG

                        (LAUGHING)
                    So Vick, how's business going?

                              VICK
                    Oh, great. Yeah, I'm working on
                    bringing the next big dessert craze
                    to Los Angeles. It's gonna be huge.

                              DOUG
                    What is it?

                              VICK
                    Bavarian custard. We ran the
                    numbers, and it's gonna be bigger
                    than fro yo.
          Doug and Stu nod, impressed; only Alan looks skeptical.

                              ALAN
                    Isn't custard like a trillion
                    calories--?

          

                                                                  5.

          

          

                              VICK
                    Our plan is to open three stores in
                    the Valley and then franchise it.
                    Shares are selling fast, but I can
                    probably squeeze you guys in...

                              DOUG
                    Yeah, man, count me in.

                              STU
                    Me too, man! I love pudding!
          Alan just shakes his head, unbelievable.

                              ALAN
                    Is this gonna do better than the
                    hip-hop label you started, Vick? Or
                    the topless sushi bar? Or the
                    mobile tattoo parlor--?

                              VICK
                    Tattoo-To-You was an idea ahead of
                    it's time, Alan! And don't come
                    crying to me when there's a Custard
                    Cabana on every street corner in
                    America and you didn't buy in--!

                              DOUG

                    All right, all right, save it for
                    the party...
          Vick and Alan quiet. Stu is still drumming the seat.

                              STU
                    Dude! I can't believe I get to

                    ...I get to sleep in! It's almost
                    too much! And FYI, if anyone gets
                    really drunk and craps themself,
                    just let me know, I can have you
                    cleaned up and partying again in

          The Caddy rolls down the famed Strip. We are again reminded

                              VICK
                    Checking in. Lennon comma Victor.
          The man types into his computer.

                              FRONT DESK MAN
                    Yes, we have you down for a one
                    night stay in an economy suite--
          Vick glances at the man's nametag; it reads "ATASHIR."

                              VICK
                    Hold it right there, Atashir. This
                    is my best friend from childhood,
                    Douglas Billings. In two days, he
                    is to marry a woman of great beauty
                    and strong teeth, do you
                    understand? A woman of gigantic
                    bosoms who will give him many, many
                    sons...
          Atashir looks confused. Alan looks embarrassed.

          

                                                                   7.

          

          

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    My two other childhood friends have
                    travelled great distances, across
                    many deserts, to be here. This
                    isn't a night in a hotel for us,
                    Atashir: this is a family reunion.
                    Perhaps you too have family
                    situated great distances away, in a
                    foreign country with much sand?
          Atashir looks like, sort of...? Vick reaches over the counter
          and touches his arm, simpatico.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Then I have but one question for
                    you, friend: if they came to town,
                    would you put them in an economy
                    suite?

                               ATASHIR
                    No, sir.

                              VICK
                    Well, then. I think one of us needs
                    to get back on his little computer
                    and find us a suitable room.
          Atashir frowns...but types away at his computer.

                              ATASHIR
                    All the deluxe rooms are taken. The
                    Dean Martin suite is available, but
                    I'd have to ask my--

                              VICK
                    Dean-o will be fine. Send up a case
                    of Cristal, two bottles of Patron,
                    four ahi sandwiches, and a crate of
                    skinless mangos...
          Vick turns to the guys:

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    You guys want anything?
          The guys stammer, too stunned to speak.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    And have Jean-Marie cook up a dozen
                    of those duck skewers I like so
                    well. He knows the ones.

                              ATASHIR
                    And how would you like to pay?

          

                                                                    8.

          

          

                              VICK
                    American Express.
          Atashir looks up to accept the card. After a beat, Vick turns
          to Alan:

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Dude, give him your AmEx.

                              ALAN
                    What?

                              VICK
                    Don't worry, we'll hit you later.
          Alan stammers.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Dude, come on, I paid for gas. Stop
                    being such a Jew.
          Alan stammers some more -- then angrily pulls out his card.

                                                              CUT TO:

          INT. THE DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- NIGHT

          The guys enter the room, jostling; Stu has Doug in a
          headlock. Then they freeze: the Dean Martin Suite is massive,
          complete with lounge area, two flat screen TVs, full bar and
          multiple bedrooms. The guys just gape.

                              STU
                    This is bigger than my house.
          Vick blows past them, totally unfazed.

                               VICK
                    Get dressed, ladies. We're wheels
                    up in ten.
          Stu and Doug race off to find their bedrooms, leaving Alan
          standing alone, just staring at the decadent suite.

                              ALAN
                    I am so not getting paid back.

          INT. DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHT

          Vick enters the bedroom, drops his bag, and starts changing
          his shirt -- when his cell phone RINGS. He answers.

                              VICK
                    This is Vick.

          

                                                                    9.

          

          
          Vick listens -- then grows a bit panicked:

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    He's in Vegas?! You're kidding me!

                        (WINCING)
                    All right, I'll get it. All right.
                    All right--!
          When Stu walks past, Vick turns away and covers the phone,
          trying to keep the call confidential:

                               VICK (CONT'D)
                    I said all right, dude! How many
                    more times you want me to say all
                    right?!

                        (BEAT)
                    All right. All right.
          Vick hangs up, looking uncharacteristically stressed...

          INT. THE DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- BATHROOM -- SAME

          Doug brushes his teeth while, at the next sink over, Alan
          selects a facial wash from his highly organized toiletries
          kit and begins washing his face.

                              ALAN
                    So, you ready for Sunday?

                              DOUG
                    Yeah. I thought I'd be nervous, but
                    I'm actually just really psyched.
          Alan nods, impressed.

                              ALAN
                    Tracy's dad still hate you?

                               DOUG
                    Oh yeah.

                              ALAN
                    Any closer to figuring out why?

                              DOUG
                    Enh, I think he wanted more for his
                    girl. I mean, I'm a teacher who
                    makes 45 grand a year, and he's a
                    titan of industry who makes 45
                    grand a day, you know? I sort of
                    get it...
                        (beat, brushing teeth)
                    Also, I'm banging his daughter. I'm
                    not sure you ever get past that.

          

                                                                  10.

          

          
          Alan smiles, yeah, there's that. Doug spits out his paste.

                              DOUG (CONT'D)
                    You got floss?
          Alan gestures towards his toiletries kit. Doug picks it up,
          starts looking for the floss. Then Alan remembers something --
          but it's too late. Doug has found the RING BOX inside Alan's
          kit, and opened it to reveal a HUGE DIAMOND ENGAGEMENT RING.

                              DOUG (CONT'D)
                    Holy Christ!
          Alan quickly reaches for the ring--

                              ALAN
                    Ahhh yeah, I wasn't going to tell
                    anyone about that--
          Just then, Stu wanders in, wearing only his COLORADO STATE
          BOXER SHORTS. His gut is sizable.

                              STU
                    Anyone got any nipple lube--?
                        (seeing ring)
                    Jesus would you look at the size of
                    that thing?!
          Stu grabs the ring from Doug.

                              DOUG
                    It's Alan's. For Becky.

                              STU
                    Jesus, who made this thing? Diddy?

                              ALAN
                        (clutching for ring)
                    Actually, I-I was trying to keep it
                    a secret, so--
          Just then Vick blows in, singing, effeminate:

                              VICK
                    Boy Party in the bathrooooom--!
                        (sees ring, snags it)
                    Miner's cut, 2.6 Carats, slight
                    pink tint, street value: 26, 27K.
          Vick studies it in the light. Alan just rubs his temples.

                              STU
                    Dude, it's for Becky! Alan's
                    finally going to propose!

          

                                                                  11.

          

          

                              VICK
                    Well gosh-golly, Alan Mervish, good
                    for you! Where'd you get the ring?

                              ALAN
                    Oh, it's a family heirloom. My
                    grandmother smuggled it through the
                    Holocaust, actually. I was going to
                    propose to Beck this weekend.
          Doug throws his arm around Alan, happy for him.

                               DOUG
                    Well: now we have two things to
                    celebrate!

                                                            CUT TO:

          TITLE CARD: "FRIDAY, 6:10 PM"

          EXT. MANDALAY BAY ROOFTOP -- NIGHT

          The guys, dressed to the nines, open the steel rooftop door
          and file out onto the flat tar roof of the Mandalay Bay; Vick
          is carrying a bottle of Patron and four hotel glasses.
          Bringing up the rear, Alan slides a wood block between the
          door and the frame so they aren't locked up here.
          The guys step out onto the dark, windy roof and take in the
          stunning panorama...the Strip...the mountains...the countless
          stars... It's breathtaking.

                              STU
                    Thish is so great! I love you guys!

                              VICK
                    Check it out, Stu's already wasted.
          Vick starts refilling everyone's glasses.

                              ALAN
                    We've only had two shots, man!

                              DOUG
                    Yeah, what happened, Stuey?! You
                    used to be able to drink us all
                    under the table!

                              STU
                    Dude, I'm a dad! I don't have time
                    to get plastered anymore! It blows!

                        (QUICKLY)
                    Am I a bad dad for saying that?

          

                                                                     12.

          

          

                                DOUG
                    What? No!

                              STU
                    Because my dad was a bad dad.

                              DOUG
                        (patting his shoulder)
                    That's true, Stuey, but you're
                    different. We've talked about this.
          Stu just stares at the guys, glassy-eyed. Beat.

                              STU
                    Have I showed you guys pictures of
                    my kids yet--?

                                ALAN & DOUG & VICK

                    YES!
          Doug laughs and raises his glass for a toast, heartfelt:

                              DOUG
                    Little toast: to Tracy, the
                    coolest, kindest, most beautiful
                    woman I've ever met. I can't
                    believe she let me come this
                    weekend -- much less agreed to
                    spend the rest of her life with me.
                    I think both will prove to be
                    massive errors of judgement on her
                    part.
          The guys chuckle, hear-hear.

                              DOUG (CONT'D)
                    And to being here, with my best
                    friends in the world. There's
                    nowhere else I'd rather be.
          The guys raise their glasses, touched.

                              DOUG (CONT'D)
                    That said, let's not get too stupid
                    tonight, okay? I'm getting married
                    in 36 hours.

                              ALAN & STU & VICK
                    No, no. / We'll be good. / Totally,
                    dude.
          Doug lowers his glass, laughing, completely unconvinced.

          

                                                                    13.

          

          

                              DOUG
                    I'm serious, dudes! Nothing above
                    the neck -- no piercings, no weird
                    haircuts, no facial tattoos. I
                    gotta look decent on Sunday.

                              VICK
                    Jesus, what do you take us for?

                              DOUG
                    Vick: you shaved Alan's eyebrows
                    off the night before graduation!

                              STU
                    Oh yeah! That was hilarious! And
                    remember when I blacked out at
                    Homecoming and you wrote on my face
                    with permanent marker?! That was
                    awesome! What'd you write again?

                              ALAN & DOUG & VICK
                    "Respect me!"
          They all laugh. Stu throws his arm around Doug, nostalgic.

                              STU
                    Ahh, good times, man. Good times...

                              VICK
                    We'll be good tonight, Doug.

                              ALAN
                    Seriously, man, we're your friends.

                              STU
                    Yeah, we've totally grown up since
                    then.
          Doug looks at them, highly dubious, then hoists his glass.

                              DOUG
                    Well then...to a night we'll never
                    forget.
          They CLINK glasses, shoot their shots, and

                                                         SMASH CUT TO:

          THE NEXT MORNING
          Shafts of white desert sunlight pour into

          

                                                                   14.

          

          

          THE DEAN MARTIN SUITE
          THE CAMERA follows a LIVE CHICKEN as it walks through the
          totalled suite.
          Furniture is broken, the minibar ransacked, and the floor is
          covered with remnants of the night before: empty beer cans,
          platefuls of room service food, a cowboy hat, the Gideon
          Bible, half-eaten skinless mangos, a bra, a battle axe, etc.
          SNORING on the couch, wearing only his jeans and one shoe,
          the word ASSHOLE written in Sharpie across his chest, is Stu.

          TITLE CARD: "SATURDAY, 11:15AM"
          The chicken struts across the top of the couch, until it
          reaches a plastic coin cup from Bellagio blocking its path.
          Beat. Then the chicken pecks it off...onto Stu.
          The cup hits Stu in the face, and stale beer splashes all
          over him. Stu spastically jerks awake and flips off the
          couch, onto a pile of newspapers.

                              PILE OF NEWSPAPERS
                    OWW! Get off! Get off! Jesus!
          Confused, Stu clambers off the pile of newspapers -- to find
          Vick sleeping underneath, on the floor, fully dressed. Vick
          pulls himself onto the couch, clearly in pain.

                              VICK
                    Damn, dude, why are you retarded?
          Both men are ragingly hungover.
          A long beat as both of them rub their faces, then:

                                 VICK (CONT'D)
                    Um, Stuey?

                                 STU
                    Yo.

                              VICK
                    Why do you have a mullet?
          Stu does, in fact, have a mullet haircut. But he's too
          hungover to understand.

                                 STU
                    What?

          

                                                                     15.

          

          

                              VICK
                    You know, business on top, party
                    down the back?
          Stu still looks confused. This is excruciating for Vick.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Your hair, dude. You have a mullet.
          Stu touches his hair. Then he stumbles into the bathroom.
          After a beat, we hear his voice:

                              STU (O.S.)
                    Dude...I have a mullet.
          Then we hear ALAN'S VOICE in the bathroom, groggy:

                              ALAN (O.S.)
                    Just give me ten more minutes,
                    Beck...

                              STU (O.S.)
                    Whoa, did you sleep in the tub?
          Beat, then Stu pokes his head out of the bathroom.

                              STU (CONT'D)
                    Check it out: Alan slept in the
                    tub.

                              VICK
                    Get him up. I'm hungry.
          Stu disappears back into the bathroom. We hear the SHOWER
          turn on. Beat. Then we hear Alan slowly awaken:

                              ALAN (O.S.)
                    Wet. Water. Jesus, what's--?!
          There's a THUD as Alan falls out of tub. Beat.
          Then Stu and a very confused, very hungover, very wet Alan
          stumble out of the bathroom.
          Alan appears to be wearing his polo shirt from the night
          before. Only, as we PULL BACK, we see that his shirt is cut
          off at his chest -- he's naked from there down.

                              VICK
                    Jesus, dude, put away your sack.
          Alan looks down at his hairy nakedness, totally bewildered.

          

                                                                    16.

          

          

                              STU
                    Yeah, and it might be time for some
                    manscaping, bro. Your bush looks
                    like Yanni.
          Alan looks back up again, squinting, hungover.

                              ALAN
                    What did we do last night?

                                                              CUT TO:

          INT. HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

          The guys, now dressed, stagger out of their suite moments
          later. Stu walks incredibly bow-legged, like an aging cowboy.

                              STU
                    Dude, why is my ass killing me...?

          INT. ELEVATOR -- MOMENTS LATER

          Looking like crap, the guys silently descend in the elevator.
          BING! The elevator opens to expose a NICE-LOOKING COUPLE
          waiting to get on. They see the guys and immediately step
          away from the elevator.

                              MAN
                    We'll...we'll get the next one.
          The doors close. The guys continue to descend. Beat.

                              VICK
                    We might not smell very good.
          The guys shake their heads, yeah, no.

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. MANDALAY BAY -- BREAKFAST BUFFET -- DAY

          The guys slouch in a booth, shoveling masses of buffet food
          into their mouths, washing it down with huge mugs of coffee.

                              STU
                    This might be the worst hangover
                    anyone has ever had, ever.

                              ALAN
                    I can't taste anything.

          

                                                                  17.

          

          

                              VICK
                    Please stop talking. If I don't
                    focus on eating I'm going to throw
                    up all over myself.
          The guys nod, right. They keep eating. After a long while:

                              ALAN
                    Hey... Are we missing something?
          The guys all slowly look around. Then Stu points at Alan:

                              STU
                    Yes: I left my hat in the room --
                    thank you, Alan.
          They continue eating. Alan looks up again, still troubled.

                              ALAN
                    No. That's not it... There's
                    something else...
          Vick nods at Stu as he stuffs food in his mouth.

                              VICK
                    You gonna finish that cruller?
          Stu shakes his head, no. Vick takes it, packs it into his
          already stuffed mouth. Then Alan realizes:

                              ALAN
                    Doug. Guys, where's Doug?
          The guys look around. Hunh.

                              STU
                    Yeah. He's not here.

                              VICK
                    Probably left him in the room.
          Vick pulls out his cell phone, starts dialing.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    I'll call his cell.
          Then a phone RINGS in Stu's pocket. He answers:

                              STU
                    Good morning, this is Stu?

                              VICK
                    It's me, meatdick.

          

                                                                     18.

          

          

                              STU
                        (to Alan, concerned)
                    It's Vick--
          Then Stu realizes. Oh.

                              STU (CONT'D)
                    This is Doug's phone.
          Vick nods, ya. He's already dialing another number.

                              ALAN
                    You calling the room?
          Vick nods, uh-huh. He lets it ring, rubbing his temples. Then
          he hangs up.

                                 VICK
                    No answer.
          Vick goes back to eating. Alan frowns.

                              ALAN
                    Ummm...shouldn't we look for him?
                    Check-out is in like ten minutes.

                              STU
                    Yeah, and we told Tracy we'd have
                    Doug back to LA by five.
          Vick just looks at both of them, his mouth full of food:

                              VICK
                    I'm eabing.

                              ALAN
                    What an asshole. Stu, check the
                    pool and the casino, I'll check the
                    room and the gym. Maybe he's
                    working out or something...
          Stu nods, and they slowly slide out of the booth.

                              ALAN (CONT'D)
                    And Vick, if you could keep a close
                    eye on the buffet, that'd be really
                    helpful. Thanks, man.
          Alan and Stu saunter off. Vick yells after them, mouth full:

                              VICK

                    HE'S FIME! YOU'RE OBERWEACTING!

          

                                                                  19.

          

          
          Vick scowls, and angrily takes Alan's last cruller.

                                                            CUT TO:

          INT. DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- MOMENTS LATER

          Alan weaves through the totalled suite, half-awake.

                              ALAN
                    Doug...? Doug...? Wake up, man.
          Alan enters the bedroom where Doug slept, and stops. It takes
          him a second to realize what's wrong:

          THE BED IS MISSING
          There are four indentations on the carpet where it once lay.
          Alan scratches his head.

                              ALAN
                    That's weird...

                                                            CUT TO:

          EXT. MANDALAY BAY -- POOL -- DAY

          Stu, walking bow-legged, squinting painfully in the bright
          sun, tries to inspect everyone lying around the huge pool.
          Doug? Doug? Several HOT WOMEN in bikinis sit up, disgusted!

                              STU
                    No, no. It's cool, I'm a dad. It's
                    totally cool...

                                                            CUT TO:

          INT. GYM -- DAY

          Alan stumbles through the gym, looking for Doug. The place is
          packed with fit people, working out. Alan mumbles to himself:

                              ALAN
                    I hate you all...

                                                            CUT TO:

          INT. CASINO FLOOR -- NICKEL SLOTS

          Stu wanders through the casino, calling out, incredibly loud:

                              STU

                    DOUG! DOUG!
          Two GAY MEN in identical tank tops pass by, holding hands.

          

                                                                  20.

          

          

                               GAY MAN
                    Hey Stu.

                              STU
                    Hey guys. DOUG! DOUG--!
          Then Stu registers what just happened. He stops and turns
          around -- enh? -- but the gay men are gone.
          Before he can comment, however, he sees Vick and Alan
          talking to Atashir at

          THE RECEPTION DESK
          He slowly bow-legs himself over.

                              STU
                    You find Doug?

                              ALAN
                    No, I assume you didn't either?
          Stu shakes his head, no. Then Atashir hangs up his phone.

                              ATASHIR
                    There is no Doug Billings at any of
                    the area hospitals, morgues, or
                    police stations.
          The guys frown, starting to grow worried.

                              STU
                    Maybe he went for a jog?

                              ALAN
                    Dude. It's 120 degrees outside.

                              STU
                    Or shopping?
          The guys just look at him like: you're an idiot.

                              ALAN
                    Great. So we've officially lost
                    Doug. His wedding is in what, 22
                    hours?

                              VICK
                    Relax, it's Doug, he's probably
                    crashed out on someone's couch
                    right now. All we have to do is
                    retrace our steps from last night,
                    and we'll find him.

          

                                                                  21.

          

          

                              ALAN
                    Okay, so last night...
          The guys wince, trying to remember. It's painful to think.

                              VICK
                    Well, we started on the roof...

                              ALAN
                    Right, that was like, 6ish...?

                              VICK
                    Then...I think...we had steaks at
                    the Palm?

                              ALAN
                    Yeah. Then...we played craps at the
                    Hard Rock...maybe?

                              VICK
                    That sounds right...
          Stu throws up his arms, already giving up.

                              STU
                    Okay, honestly? I don't even
                    remember going to dinner.

                              VICK
                    I vaguely recall...doing body shots
                    ....at some point? Is that...maybe?

                               ALAN
                    I'm pretty much blank after The
                    Hard Rock.

                              VICK
                    I think we went to the Flamingo
                    after that...? And then, I just
                    remember a lot of blue light...and
                    the overpowering smell of baby oil.

                              ALAN
                    So that was what, 10ish?

                              VICK
                    Give or take.

                              STU
                    Was Doug still with us?
          Vick rubs his temples, trying to fight through the hangover.

          

                                                                  22.

          

          

                              VICK
                    Yes. Yes. Doug was with us. I
                    tackled him...for some reason.
          The guys nod, okay, okay.

                              ALAN
                    Okay. So we only have a 13 hour
                    window where we could've lost him.
          They guys frown. Shit. Stu puts his hands into his pockets,
          thinking... Then he feels something. A matchbook.
          He pulls it out. It's from The Flamingo Nightclub.

                              STU
                    Hey! Look, we were at the Flamingo.
          A long beat of silence...
          Then the guys hurry to an empty BLACKJACK TABLE and start
          emptying their pockets of the detritus from the night before.
          They find matchbooks, receipts, room keys, a valet ticket...

                              ALAN
                    ATM receipt from the Rio at 10:37--
                        (reading it)
                    For 600 dollars?!

                              VICK
                    The valet ticket says we returned
                    here at 4:57AM.

                              STU
                    We drove last night?
          The guys wince, jesus...

                              ALAN
                    Here's a receipt from Sbarro. The
                    meal was comped for some reason--

                              VICK
                    Why do we have a matchbook from The
                    Golden Pony All Male Revue?
          The guys exchange a look, alarmed.

                              ALAN
                    Someone could've given that to us.

          

                                                                    23.

          

          

                              STU
                        (laughing, nervous)
                    Yeah, totally! There's no way we
                    went there! We're not gay! Hahaha!
          They frown, then stare at all the clues lined up on the
          blackjack table.

                              ALAN
                    I think we should call Tracy.

                              VICK
                    Absolutely not.

                              ALAN
                    What if Doug called her? She might
                    know where he is.
          Stu shifts uncomfortably, tenderly adjusting his ass.

                              STU
                    Yeah, I'm with Alan on this one.

                              VICK
                    Of course you're with Alan, you're
                    both gutless cowards. But we're not
                    calling Tracy. You never call the
                    bride from the bachelor party.
                    Ever. If my balls were on fire and
                    Tracy was sitting next door with a
                    tall glass of water, I still
                    wouldn't call her. It's a rule.

                              ALAN
                    But shouldn't we at least tell her
                    we're gonna be getting home late?

                              VICK
                    She has a watch, she'll figure it
                    out.

                              ALAN
                    I think I'm beginning to see why
                    you're always single.

                              VICK
                    And I think I'm beginning to see
                    why you're always a douche--

                              STU
                        (clutching his ass)
                    Guys, wait. I need your help -- oh
                    my God -- like right now. Come on.

          

                                                                    24.

          

          

                              ALAN
                    Jesus, what is it?

                                                            CUT TO:

          INT. BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

          Vick and Alan unhappily stand in the lavish, gold-ensconsed
          men's room, watching Stu painfully undo his jeans.

                              VICK
                    I can't believe we're doing this.

                              STU
                    You don't have to look up my butt,
                    just at it. Something is terribly,
                    terribly wrong...
          Stu's jeans fall to the ground -- and everyone freezes.

          
          He's wearing a snug FLUORESCENT PINK G-STRING with "I
          ROGER" written vertically down the front. In glitter.

                              ALAN
                    Sweet mother of mercy...

                              VICK
                    Who's Roger?

                              STU
                    I-I-I don't know?! What do you
                    think it means?!

                              VICK
                    What do I think it means? Well,
                    Stuart, your ass is all torn up and
                    you're wearing thong underwear
                    declaring your love for another
                    dude -- I don't think we need the
                    CSI team for this one! You got
                    reamed last night, man!
          Stu covers his mouth, horrified!

                              ALAN
                    I'm sure there's a perfectly
                    logical explanation for this...

                              STU
                    Really?! What?!
          Alan tries to think of one.

          

                                                           25.

          

          

                              ALAN
                    Yeah, maybe there isn't.

                              VICK
                    Look, I'm sure Roger is a very
                    nice, considerate young man--

                              STU
                    Oh my God, guys: what if I'm gay?!

                              VICK
                    Come on, Stu, you're nowhere near
                    cool enough.

                              STU
                        (gasping, realizing)
                    I do watch Dancing With The Stars
                    with the kids!

                              ALAN
                    Oh god, that doesn't mean you're
                    gay.

                              VICK
                    But sort of...it does?
          Stu grows increasingly frantic.

                              STU
                    And once, I caught myself gazing at
                    a topless photo of David Beckham!

                              ALAN
                    So what, he's a great-looking dude--

                              STU
                    And then I had those weird feelings
                    for Vick that time in middle
                    school, remember?!
          Everyone stops. Vick most of all.

                                VICK
                    Um, what?

                              STU
                    Yeah, that weekend we were all
                    camping -- I told you this.

                              VICK
                    Yeah, no you didn't.

                                STU
                    I didn't?

          

                                                                    26.

          

          

                              VICK
                    I think I'd remember, dude.

                              ALAN
                    Yeah, I think we'd all remember.

                               STU
                    Yeah. I had weird feelings for you
                    that weekend. Like really hot,
                    really gay feelings. But then they
                    went away.
          Vick is just looking at him, stunned.

                              ALAN
                    Wait -- I was there that weekend.
                    Did you have gay feelings for me?

                              VICK
                    Unbelievable.

                              ALAN
                    What?! I was a good-looking kid!

                              VICK
                    Please, you're so not his type!

                              STU
                    Wait, what?
          Just then, a FATHER and his YOUNG SON enter the men's room
          and see Stu standing there, pants down, in his G string...

                              VICK
                    Look, Stu, one homosexual
                    experience doesn't mean you're
                    permanently gay, okay? A lot of
                    guys test the waters.
          ...the FATHER and SON wheel right back around and exit.

                              ALAN
                    All right, we're scaring the
                    children. Let's go.
          The guys head for the door. Stu quickly pulls up his pants.

                              STU
                    Wait -- so have either of you
                    tested the waters?

                              VICK
                    No! We're not gay!

          

                                                                  27.

          

          
          Stu looks highly confused as he follows them out onto

          THE CASINO FLOOR
          The guys power through the crowded casino, towards the exit.
          Stu tries to keep up, genuinely concerned.

                              STU
                    How am I going to tell my wife?

                              VICK
                    Quickly, and from a great distance.
          Alan's hand accidentally hits a brass railing and CLINKS...

                              STU
                    Jesus, what kind of father am I?
          Alan's hand CLINKS against the railing again, and this time
          it registers. Alan looks down -- and stops cold.

                                 ALAN
                    Oh my God.

                              STU
                        (really scared)
                    You think Erin will try to take the
                    kids--?

                              ALAN
                    Oh...my...God.

                              VICK
                        (turning, annoyed)
                    What now?
          Alan holds up the source of his CLINKING: on his ring finger
          is a huge, tacky, silver WEDDING RING with a unicorn on it.

                              STU
                        (not getting it)
                    Cool ring. Also, my Dad is gonna
                    have a field day with this.
          Vick, however, recognizes the implications of the ring, and
          starts back towards Alan.

                              VICK
                    Oh my God... Oh my God...

                              STU
                    What's the big--?
                        (finally realizing)
                    Oh! OH! OH!

          

                                                                   28.

          

          
          Alan steadies himself against a SLOT MACHINE, and shakily
          takes off the massive unicorn ring.

                              STU (CONT'D)
                    Maybe it's not a wedding ring?

                              ALAN
                        (reading inscription)
                    "To My Noble Husband, Alan."
          The guys eyes bulge, oh shit!

                              STU
                    This is worse than my underwear!
          Vick takes the ring and reads the rest of the inscription:

                              VICK
                    "Now & Forever Wedding Chapel."
          They guys exchange a look.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Well, at least it's a lead.
          Beat. Then Alan turns and THROWS UP all over the slot
          machine. Nearby OCTOGENARIAN SLOT PLAYERS look over,
          disgusted -- but continue playing their nickels.

                                                            CUT TO:

          EXT. MANDALAY BAY -- VALET STAND -- DAY

          The three guys exit the hotel looking like crap. Vick hands
          his ticket to the valet. Alan chews mint gum.

                              VICK
                    So, we go to the wedding chapel, we
                    find out what we did with Doug, we
                    recover him, and we're back in LA
                    before sundown. Easy as Stu's ass.
          No one laughs. Tense SILENCE as they wait for the car.

                              STU
                    Check it out, some idiot threw his
                    bed out the window last night.
          Stu points over at a huge stone GRIFFIN in front of the hotel
          with an ENTIRE BED impaled upon its ear.

                              ALAN
                    That was us, dude.

          

                                                                    29.

          

          

                              STU
                    Really?

                              ALAN
                    Yeah, there's no bed in Doug's
                    room.

                               STU

                        (FROWNING)
                    Oh. Well, I'm sure we had a good
                    reason for doing it.

                        (BEAT)
                    You think they'll charge us for--?

                              ALAN
                    Yeah, Stu, I really do.

                              VICK
                    Guys, relax. Everything's gonna be
                    cool...
          Just then the Valet drives up in

          VICK'S DESTROYED CADILLAC
          The exterior is scratched and filthy, like it's been off-
          roading. The hubcaps are gone, as is the front passenger side
          door. A wisp of STEAM trails up from under the hood.
          The guys just stand there, agape.

                              STU
                    You okay, Vick?

                               VICK
                    I'm not emotionally prepared to
                    talk about it just yet, Stuart, but
                    thank you.
          Vick dons his sunglasses and heads for his destroyed car...

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:

          THE GUYS ROLLING DOWN THE STRIP
          in their ridiculous car. Cars full of FAMILIES, cute GIRLS,
          even NUNS, point and stare. Our guys just face forward, each
          quietly suffering in their own personal Hell.

                              ALAN
                    Seriously: what am I gonna tell
                    Becky? For 14 years she's been
                    begging me to get married...

          

                                                                    30.

          

          

                              VICK
                    Well, now you did. Just not to her.
          Alan glowers at the city going by... Then he sits up--

                              ALAN
                    Wait, is that homeless guy wearing
                    Doug's shirt?
          The guys turn to see a HOMELESS GUY weaving down the sidewalk
          in Doug's DISTINCTIVE ORANGE SHIRT from the night before.
          Once they pass, the guys exchange a look.

                                 STU
                    Naaah.

                              VICK
                    Yeah, that was a different shirt.
          Alan doesn't look so sure. They drive in silence. Then:

                                 VICK (CONT'D)
                    Left turn.
          Stu, sitting shotgun, braces against the empty doorframe so
          as not to fall out of the car as they turn left...

          EXT. NOW & FOREVER WEDDING CHAPEL -- DAY

          Sitting in an East Vegas strip mall, sandwiched between a
          laundromat and a pawn shop, is the pink Now & Forever Wedding
          Chapel. The Cadillac parks in the lot out front.

          INT. NOW & FOREVER WEDDING CHAPEL -- DAY

          Everything in the small, tacky wedding chapel is white
          plastic. White plastic plants, white plastic cross, white
          plastic chairs. The guys enter.

                              ALAN
                    What if they don't remember us--?

                                 VOICE BEHIND THEM

                    AAAAYYYYY!
          The guys turn to find the hirsute owner of the chapel, STEVE
          GIANOPOLUS, 40's, in a tight white suit, his arms spread
          wide. Steve is all Vegas, by way of Long Island.

                              STEVE
                    How are you, you dumb bastards?!

          

                                                                  31.

          

          
          He warmly hugs the guys. They have zero memory of him, and it
          shows as they hug back weakly, unfamiliar...

                              STEVE (CONT'D)

                    CARLA, GET YOUR FAT ASS OUT HERE!

                    ALAN AND THE BOYS ARE HERE!
                        (to the guys)
                    You here to pick up your wedding
                    photos?!
          Alan starts to decline, when--

                              VICK
                    Does the pope wear a funny hat?!
                    Let's do this thing!
          Steve CACKLES and guides them over to a table; Alan scowls.

                              STEVE
                    And where is Chastity today?
          They all sit on white plastic chairs.

                              ALAN
                    W-Who's...Chastity?

                              STEVE

                        (LAUGHING)
                    Your wife, man--! AWW, you're just
                    breaking my balls!
          Alan looks ill. Laughing, Steve retrieves a folder and starts
          laying out a series of WEDDING PHOTOS on the table. Vick
          eagerly peruses them, enjoying this.

                               VICK
                    Uh, it was such a lovely ceremony,
                    wasn't it?

                              STEVE
                    Hand to God, I've never seen two
                    people more in love!

                              VICK
                    Sadly, I believe you...
          The guys look at the photos of Alan's wedding from the night
          before. They're typical wedding shots, only the guys are all
          wearing MEDIEVAL COSTUMES, swords, bows, tights, even armor.
          They look incredibly happy -- and incredibly drunk.
          The next photo is of Alan and his BUSTY BLONDE BRIDE. She's
          having a blast in a white medieval gown and tiara.

          

                                                                  32.

          

          

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Hello, Chastity...
          Alan just closes his eyes, oh God.

                              ALAN
                    I am never...ever...drinking again.

                              STU
                    Jesus, she is stacked.

                              VICK
                    Stu, please, show some class.
                    That's Alan's wife you're talking
                    about.

                              STU
                        (to Alan, guilty)
                    Sorry. She looks really nice.
          But Alan is too busy gaping at the next photo, of him and
          Chastity atop a UNICORN in the chapel. (It is, of course, a
          rented pony with a lame horn strapped to its head.)

                              ALAN
                    We got a unicorn?!

                              STEVE
                    Oh, yeah, you got the entire Double
                    Camelot Package.
          Alan just rubs his temples, oh no.

                              ALAN
                    A-And how much did that cost?

                              STEVE
                    7 thousand dollars.
          Alan closes his eyes. Stu and Vick exchange a look, no way!

                              STEVE (CONT'D)
                    Yeah, you didn't want to get it,
                    either, but Vick insisted.
          Beat. Then Alan pounces across the table at Vick!

                              ALAN
                    I'm gonna kill you!

                              VICK
                        (fending him off)
                    You can't put a pricetag on love,
                    Alan! OW! You just can't!

          

                                                                    33.

          

          
          Stu hops up and starts pulling Alan off of Vick.

                              VOICE BEHIND THEM

                    STOP FIGHTING IMMEDIATELY!
          The guys straighten like schoolboys as Steve's wife CARLA,
          40's, enters. She's wearing a toga, smoking a menthol, and
          dollying in several large CARDBOARD BOXES. Then she grins:

                              CARLA
                    Ahhh! I'm just busting your nuts!
          She lowers the dolly and hurries over for hugs.

                              CARLA (CONT'D)
                    Good to see you, you stupid mooks!
          Stu and Alan force smiles, no idea who this woman is. Vick,
          on the other hand, steps forward and hugs her tightly.

                              VICK
                    It's good to be seen, Carla. It's
                    good to be seen.

                              CARLA
                    I brought the rest of your package.
          Carla begins unloading things from the cardboard boxes.

                              CARLA (CONT'D)
                    First: Two dozen commuter mugs...
          She unpacks 24 COMMUTER MUGS with Alan and Chastity's photo
          emblazoned on them. Alan winces, oh god. Stu grabs one:

                              STU
                    No way! Awesome!

                              STEVE
                    A hundred DVDs of the ceremony...
          She lays out the stacks of DVDs. Vick nods at Alan:

                              VICK
                    For you and Chastity to watch on
                    your anniversary...
          Alan just clenches his jaw, I fucking hate you.

                              CARLA
                    The velvet wall hanging...
          She pulls out a six foot air-brushed velvet WALL HANGING of
          Alan and Chastity riding the unicorn together in outer space.

          

                                                                    34.

          

          

                              VICK
                    And it looks like real velvet,
                    Alan, so no machine wash, okay?

                              CARLA
                    And the big finish:
          Vick and Stu do a DRUMROLL on the table, excited...
          Then Carla pulls out a FOUR FOOT BRONZE SHIELD with a bas-
          relief of Alan and Chastity MAKING OUT on it. Alan just
          closes his eyes.

                                 STU

                    HOLY CRAP!

                              VICK

                    DUDE, YOU HAVE A SHIELD!

                              STU
                    I want a shield!

                              VICK
                    Me too! Hey, can Stu and I get a
                    shield?

                              ALAN
                    I don't suppose you have any sort
                    of return policy, do you?

                              STEVE
                    Um...if you know another couple who
                    looks exactly like you guys, and
                    who want two dozen commuter mugs, a
                    wall hanging, and a shield...sure.
          Alan scowls. Then his cellphone RINGS. He angrily answers it
          without looking at the Caller ID.

                                 ALAN
                    What.
          We hear someone YELLING AT HIM. Alan's eyes bulge.

                              ALAN (CONT'D)
                    Oh, hey Becky! Hi!
          He steps away to take the call. Vick explains to Carla:

                              VICK
                    That's his girlfriend of 14 years.
                    I'm sure this'll only take a
                    minute...

          

                                                                  35.

          

          
          Vick and Stu go back to looking at the wedding photos as Alan
          tries to talk to his furious girlfriend.

          INTERCUT WITH:

          BECKY
          in her Laura Ashley bedroom, angrily packing up her suitcase.
          She's beautiful and preppy in pearls and a sweater set.

                              BECKY
                    Can you tell me why all the goddamn
                    credit cards are maxed out?!

                              ALAN
                    No! I-I have no idea--!
          Then Vick calls over from the white plastic table, pissed:

                              VICK

                    HEY ALAN, HOW COME I WASN'T YOUR

                    BEST MAN, DUDE!

                              STU

                    YEAH, WHAT THE HELL, ME EITHER!

                    WHY'D YOU PICK DOUG?!
          Alan waves at them, shut the hell up! But Becky has heard.

                              BECKY
                    "Your best man?!" What's going on
                    there, Alan?!

                              ALAN
                    Nothing! Baby, nothing, the GUYS

                    ARE JUST BEING DICKS!

                              VICK

                    HEY ALAN, YOU WANT ALL YOUR WALLET-

                    SIZED WEDDING PHOTOS, OR CAN I

                    BOGART A FEW?!
          Alan furiously flips them off, shut up!

                              BECKY
                    I really don't appreciate being
                    mocked right now, Alan, especially
                    about wedding-related issues. You
                    know how hard this weekend is going
                    to be for me.

                              ALAN
                    I know, baby! I know--

          

                                                                  36.

          

          

                              BECKY
                    So you'll call the credit card
                    company and straighten this out?

                              ALAN
                    Yes. I will. I promise.

                              BECKY
                    Okay. Okay...
                        (beat, calming)
                    Look, sorry I'm so tense... I'll
                    see you soon, okay? Love you.
          But Alan is just staring at the BRONZE SHIELD of him making
          out with his blonde bombshell wife...

                              BECKY (CONT'D)
                    Alan? Hello? I said I love you?!

                              ALAN
                    Yes, no, I love you too!
          Becky hangs up, rolling her eyes, unbelievable.
          STAY WITH ALAN as he closes his cellphone. Exhales.

                              STU
                    Hey, how's Becky doing, man?!

                              VICK
                    Yeah, did she ask about us?!
          Off of Alan's hate-filled glare, we

                                                            CUT TO:

          STEVE AND THE GUYS SCHLEPPING ALL OF THE WEDDING CRAP
          through the strip mall parking lot, back to their car. Alan
          sullenly carries the GIANT BRONZE SHIELD.

                              STU
                    Look on the bright side, Alan. Vick
                    found a great clue.

                              VICK
                    Turns out Doug was in all the
                    wedding photos, which means -- if
                    the time stamp was right -- we had
                    him in our possession until 11 pm.

          

                                                                  37.

          

          

                              STU
                    That's another hour of last night
                    that we can account for. Isn't that
                    great?

                              ALAN
                        (bitterly sarcastic)
                    Amazing.

                              VICK
                    Hey, Steve, you don't happen to
                    know where we were heading when we
                    left here last night, do you?

                              STEVE
                    Well, the Double Camelot Package
                    comes with a five course wedding
                    feast, so I assume you went there.

                              STU
                    Great -- where was the feast?

                              STEVE
                    Sbarro, over in the Fremont mall.

                                                            CUT TO:

                              ALAN (V.O.)
                    I paid 7 grand for Sbarro?!

          INT. VICK'S CAR -- MOMENTS LATER

          The beatup Caddy is packed with wedding crap. Vick is busy
          trying to reverse the overloaded car out of the parking spot.
          Stu's in the backseat with the huge shield, while Alan
          seethes up front.

                              VICK
                    Your negativity is like a little
                    black cloud over our car, Alan.
                    You've got to let go of this.

                              ALAN
                    Let go of what, exactly, Vick?! The
                    fact that I married a complete
                    stranger last night? Or that my
                    girlfriend's about to leave me? Or
                    that I'm broke? Which one?!

                              VICK
                    You're broke? I thought you were

                    LOADED--

          

                                                                  38.

          

          

                              ALAN
                    I know you think it's like
                    terminally uncool to be in a
                    committed relationship, Vick, but I
                    actually love Becky, okay?

                        (SINCERE)
                    I-I honestly don't know what I'd do
                    without her...I really don't...
          Alan looks off, lost, sick. Vick stops the car short.

                              VICK
                    Alan. Honey. Have you considered,
                    even for a second, that maybe the
                    things we do when we're drunk are
                    what we secretly want to do?

                              ALAN
                        (dripping with sarcasm)
                    Yeah, no, you're absolutely right,
                    Vick, I've always secretly wanted
                    to marry a bottle blonde with big
                    fake melon tits named Chastity!

                              STU
                    I ain't mad atcha, dude...

                               VICK
                    Or, after 14 years, maybe you don't
                    have the balls to leave Becky, and
                    this is your way of getting her to
                    leave you.

                              ALAN
                    I was going to propose to her this
                    weekend, you jackass!

                              VICK
                    All the more reason to freak out.
          Alan opens his mouth to respond, but nothing comes out. Vick
          nods, chew on that, and continues slowly reversing the car.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    I love you, Alan Mervish, I do, but
                    you've always had a major pole up
                    your ass. Maybe last night was your
                    inner cool person trying to get out-

                              ALAN
                    I swear to God, Vick, if you say
                    one more word to me, I will destroy
                    you.

          

                                                                  39.

          

          

                              STU
                    Guys, come on, let's not use our
                    angry words--

          SMASH!
          A baseball bat SHATTERS the windshield! The guys all jump!
          Vick slams on the brakes!

                              VICK
                    What the--?!
          They look up to see two MASSIVE SAMOAN MEN in loud Hawaiian
          shirts, KALOLO FANALUA and KIKIOLANI, 30's, standing on
          either side of the car. And they look pissed.

                              KALOLO FANALUA
                    Get out of the car, Vick.
          Stu and Alan recoil in terror.

                              STU
                    Who are these guys?!

                              VICK
                    Stu, please.
                        (to Kalolo Fanalua)
                    I think there's been some sort of
                    mistake, Mister...?

                              KALOLO FANALUA
                    I'm Mr. Shut The Hell Up And Get
                    The Hell Outta The Car, and this is
                    my associate, Mr. Smash You In The
                    Teeth If You Say Another Word.

                              VICK
                        (beat, to Alan)
                    Those so aren't their real names.

                              ALAN
                    Vick, don't be a dick--!

                              VICK
                    Alan? Relax. These men aren't going
                    to hurt us. They're from Hawaii.

          SMASH! SMASH! SMASH!
          Kikiolani starts viciously smashing the car!

                              KALOLO FANALUA
                    We're from Guam, bitch! Now get
                    outta the car!

          

                                                                    40.

          

          

                              VICK
                    Okay, okay! Cool it with the bat!
                    Jesus, why is everyone trying to
                    kill my car...?
          Vick undoes his seatbelt   and reaches for his door handle.
          Kikiolani lowers his bat   -- and Vick throws the door open,
          right into his nuts! The   huge Samoan staggers back, OWWW, and
          Vick slams his door shut   and

          FLOORS IT OUT OF THERE IN REVERSE!
          The Caddy sideswipes a car, hops the curb, and lands on the
          street! They SQUEAL AWAY, the huge bronze shield flying out
          of the backseat as they do! It CLATTERS on the pavement...

          EXT. EAST VEGAS STREET -- CONTINUOUS

          Vick drives like the wind, trying to see around the huge
          SPIDERWEB in the windshield. Alan and Stu are freaking out.

                              ALAN
                    Why'd you do that?!

                              VICK

                        (INCREDULOUS)
                    Really?

                              STU
                    Maybe they just wanted to talk!

                              VICK
                    I honestly don't know how you two
                    are still alive.

                              ALAN
                    Do you think we stole something
                    from them last night?!

                              STU
                    Oh my god I am such a bad dad!

                              ALAN
                        (producing cellphone)
                    I'm calling the police. This is
                    getting way out of control--

                              VICK
                    No! No cops!

                              ALAN
                    "No cops?!" Who are you, Fitty
                    Cent?!

          

                                                                  41.

          

          

                              STU
                    Yeah, Vick, what's going on?

                              VICK
                    Nothing! I just think we should
                    focus on finding Doug and not get
                    distracted by every little thing!

                              ALAN
                    Every little thing?! We were just
                    assaulted by the Yakuza!

                              VICK
                    Oh please, those guys are from
                    Guam. Get a grip.

                              ALAN
                    They knew your name, Vick! Which
                    means they probably know who Stu
                    and I are, too!

                              STU
                    If anything ever happened to my
                    family, Vick...

                              VICK
                    Fine. Let's just go back to the
                    hotel -- Doug is probably back from
                    wherever he spent the night, we'll
                    get him, we'll straighten out
                    whatever we did to those angry
                    Samoans, then we'll get the hell
                    back to LA, okay? Left turn.
          Vick angrily takes a harder-than-necessary left turn. Alan
          hangs on tight, almost flying out of the car.

                                                            CUT TO:

          TITLE CARD: "SATURDAY, 2:26 PM"

          INT. DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- DAY

          The boys hurry into their room, stressed.

                              VICK
                    Doug? Doug?
          Alan quickly checks the room phone.

                              ALAN
                    No messages.

          

                                                                  42.

          

          

                              STU
                    Come on, let's toss the place.
          Alan starts wading through the crap in the living room, while
          Vick and Stu head off to check the bedrooms...

          INT. BEDROOM

          Stu brushes aside beer bottles and room service dishes,
          looking for anything relevant. He spots a LEGAL CONTRACT on
          the ground. Picks it up.

                              STU
                    Hey, check it out, Vick! I invested
                    30 grand in your custard store last
                    night!
          Vick calls from the other bedroom.

                              VICK (O.S.)
                    Smart move, man.
          Stu opens the closet door -- and freezes.

                              STU
                    Hey, you wanna come in here a sec?!
          Vick enters a moment later to find Stu staring into the
          closet. Vick follows his gaze and sees a SEXY WOMAN snoring
          away on the closet floor, her blonde hair obscuring her face.

                              VICK
                    Whoa.

                              STU
                    You think she's what those Guamian
                    dudes wanted?

                              VICK
                    No. I think she's Alan's wife.
          Stu covers his mouth, oh shit! Vick produces the wallet-
          sized photos from Alan's wedding, compares them, and nods.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Alan? Wanna step in here, buddy?
          A second later Alan enters, what's up?

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Alan, Chastity. Chastity, Alan.
          Alan looks down, sees Chastity SNORING on the closet floor,
          her body all contorted, and freezes. Oh my God.

          

                                                                  43.

          

          

                              ALAN
                    What...what am I supposed to do?

                              STU
                    Wake her up, man!

                               ALAN
                    Why me?!

                              VICK
                    Because she's your spouse, dude!
          Scowling, Alan slowly crouches down. Then, a little scared,
          he nudges her. Nothing. He nudges her harder.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Pinch her tit. It always works.
          Alan shakes her a bit harder and -- BRRAPPPP -- the girl lets
          out a massive burp and awakens, COUGHING. Alan jumps back up,
          terrified. The woman, CHASTITY, looks around, disoriented.

                              CHASTITY
                    Dang, did I sleep in the closet
                    again...?
          Then she notices the guys staring down at her. She smiles,
          recognizing them:

                              CHASTITY (CONT'D)
                    Oh hey, guys! What's up?
          She shakily climbs to her feet to expose a skimpy skirt, a
          snug tube top, and mascara smeared all over her face.
          The guys have no idea what to say. She kisses Alan on the
          cheek, very intimate -- like, well, a husband and wife.

                              CHASTITY (CONT'D)
                    Morning, honey...
          She exits into the living room, picking her wedgie.
          Beat. Alan is speechless.

                              STU
                    She seems really cool.

                              VICK
                    Yeah, I really like her, man.

          

                                                                  44.

          

          

          INT. DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- LIVING ROOM

          Chastity gathers her belongings -- jacket, purse, G string --
          from around the totalled living room. The guys file in.

                              VICK
                    So, um, did you take Alan's name?

                              STU
                    Yeah, are you Chastity Mervish
                    now--?

                              ALAN
                    Listen to me. Just...did we, or did
                    we not, have sex last night?
          Alan braces, please say no, please say no...
          Vick braces, please say yes, please say yes...

                                 CHASTITY
                    Well...ya?
          Alan slumps, his life over. Vick pumps his fist, YES!

                              CHASTITY (CONT'D)
                    But we waited til we were married.
          Alan GROANS.

                              VICK
                    What a responsible, upstanding
                    young Jew. They don't make `em like
                    that anymore, am I right?
          Chastity smiles, sweet, as she straps on her 6 inch heels.

                              CHASTITY
                    I know -- he even wanted to use a
                    rubber.
          Alan breaks into a COUGHING FIT.

                              ALAN
                    Wait-- we didn't use a condom?!

                              CHASTITY
                    It's cool, I sponge.
          Alan leans against a wall, dizzy.

                              ALAN
                    Can someone...please open a window?

          

                                                                 45.

          

          
          Stu turns and tries to open a window. No luck.

                              STU
                    They don't open.

                              CHASTITY
                    So you guys don't remember any of
                    last night?

                              VICK
                    Yeah, not so much.

                              CHASTITY
                    Hey, been there before, right?
                        (grabbing her sizable bra)
                    Sucks, though. The wedding was
                    really fun. I'm bummed you don't
                    remember it, Alan.
          She smiles, a little saddened. Stu whispers to Alan:

                              STU
                    Dude, I think your wife's mad at
                    you.

                              VICK
                    You don't happen to remember what
                    time we met you last night, do you?

                              CHASTITY
                    Sure, we met at the bar at like
                    10:00? Then we got married on my
                    smoke break, which was like 11:00?

                              VICK
                    It's the All-American love story,
                    isn't it? What happened next?

                              CHASTITY
                    Well, I had to go back to work. But
                    when I got off at 5:30, I met up
                    with you guys back here.

                              VICK
                    And was Doug with us then?

                              CHASTITY
                    No.

                              VICK
                    Interesting... Do you have any idea
                    where we went after the wedding?

          

                                                                      46.

          

          

                                CHASTITY
                      No, but I bet some of my work
                      friends do. You were partying with
                      them pretty hard.

                                STU
                      Work friends?

                                                           SMASH CUT TO:

          STRIPPERS
          Dozens of `em, dancing, grinding, shimmying on poles.

          INT. CRAZY HORSE GENTLEMEN'S CLUB -- DAY

          Chastity leads the guys through Vegas's Most Notorious Strip
          Club, The Crazy Horse. It's bacchanalia writ large, complete
          with throbbing music, flashing strobe lights, and six stages
          of spinning flesh. The place is mobbed with PATRONS.
          Alan follows after Chastity, horrified.

                                ALAN
                      You work here?
          Behind him, Vick SLAPS FIVE with Stu, psyched.

                                CHASTITY
                      Yeah -- and this is the pole where
                      we first met!
          She stops at a pole, around which a BRUNETTE STRIPPER
          currently spins. Alan looks ill.

                                CHASTITY (CONT'D)
                      It's always been my lucky pole...

                                ALAN
                      Look, I don't know how to tell you
                      this, but--

                                CHASTITY

                      HEY PLATINUM, CHECK IT OUT!
          She holds up her hand, showing off ALAN'S GRANDMOTHER'S RING
          to the stripper currently upside-down on the pole.

                                PLATINUM THE STRIPPER
                      Get it, girl!

                                CHASTITY
                      Come on, let's go meet my
                      bridesmaids!

          

                                                                  47.

          

          
          She hurries off, but Alan can't move.

                              STU
                    Dude.

                              VICK
                    I know.

                              ALAN
                    The Holocaust, man.
          Alan just stares into space. Vick takes him by the shoulder.

                              VICK
                    Look, we can get your grandmother's
                    ring back. We just gotta go about
                    it in the right way.

                              ALAN
                    I have besmirched my people.

                              STU
                    Don't be so hard on yourself, dude--
          Just then Chastity runs back over with two BLONDE STRIPPERS.

                              CHASTITY
                    These were my bridesmaids,
                    Anastasia and Starr!

                              STARR
                    Hey, boys! Good to see you again!

                              ANASTASIA
                    Mazel Tov--!

                              ALAN
                    Please...don't.
          Just then a SPOTLIGHT finds Chastity and Alan, and the SLEAZY
          PONYTAILED DJ up in the booth comes over the P.A. system:

                              STRIP CLUB D.J.

                    OKAY, GUYS! LET'S GIVE A CRAZY

                    HORSE SHOUT-OUT TO OUR HAPPY NEW

                    COUPLE, CHASTITY AND ALANNNN!
          The entire club CHEERS! Chastity holds up her wedding ring
          and dances around, WOO HOO! Alan waves meekly. Thanks.

                              STRIPPER D.J.

                    IN HONOR OF THEIR MARRIAGE, WE'RE

                    DOING TWO-FOR-ONE LAPDANCES! TWO

                    SONGS FOR TWENTY BUCKS!

          

                                                                  48.

          

          
          The DJ puts on Nine Inch Nails' "I Want to Fuck You Like An
          Animal" and the club gets hopping again.

                              CHASTITY
                    Oh my God, he's playing our song!
                        (giddy, to Alan)
                    This song was playing when we met,
                    remember?! You kept sliding
                    twenties into my thong and saying
                    "I will always love you. I will
                    always love you."
          Alan closes his eyes.

                                ALAN
                    Twenties?

                              CHASTITY
                    Yeah, it was so sweet...

                              ALAN
                    Look, I don't know how to say this,
                    but my friends and I were very
                    drunk last night. We would never
                    come to a place like this--
          He glances over at Vick and Stu -- but they're gone.

                                ALAN (CONT'D)
                    Guys?

                                                            CUT TO:

          VICK AND STU TOASTING SHOTS OF JAGERMEISTER
          and downing them. PULL BACK to see that they are sitting in

          THE CHAMPAGNE ROOM
          getting lapdances from STARR and ANASTASIA. The Champagne
          Room is a dark, plush private suite in the back of the Crazy
          Horse where strippers ply their craft; the room is half full.
          Vick watches Starr lean over and make out with Anastasia.

                              VICK
                    You are the best bridesmaids ever.

                              STU
                        (huge boobs in his face)
                    Dude: I might not be gay.
          Then Alan hurries in with Chastity; he looks pissed.

          

                                                          49.

          

          

                              ALAN
                    What the hell are you doing?!

                              VICK
                    Two-for-ones, man.

                              ALAN
                    We don't have time for this! We
                    gotta find Doug!

                              VICK
                    What do you think we're doing?

                              ALAN
                    What?

                              VICK
                    We're getting into the mindset of
                    last night, to see if it sparks any
                    memories.
                        (to his stripper)
                    Now: is this exactly how you were
                    dancing for me last night, Starr?
          She nods. Vick nods, pensive, scientific.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Yeah, still no memories. Keep going
                    -- and put your back into it.

                              ALAN
                    You are so goddamn selfish, Vick.
                    You really are. Stu, let's go.

                              VICK
                    No. Stu, sit and enjoy your dance.
          Stu looks between them, torn.

                              ALAN
                    Dude: Doug is missing! We have less
                    than 18 hours til his wedding! We
                    do not have time for this!

                              VICK
                    I'm trying to save your life here,
                    Alan Mervish.

                              ALAN
                    Vick--!

          

                                                                    50.

          

          

                              VICK
                    I'm not kidding, man! Life is one
                    long series of emergencies, and if
                    you don't learn to stop and have a
                    little fun along the way, you're
                    gonna grow into a joyless old prick
                    like your dad. I'm sorry to bring
                    Moshe Mervish into it, but it had
                    to be said. Now yes, we have 18
                    hours to find Doug -- which means
                    we can afford to spend ten minutes
                    celebrating the special talents of
                    these gifted young body-artists. So
                    sit down, have a jager shot, and
                    smell the goddamn roses for once in
                    your miserable life. Chastity,
                    honey? When you're ready?
          Chastity pushes Alan onto the red leather banquette and
          starts dancing for him. He tries to squirm away:

                              ALAN
                    No, look-- I am like totally
                    against this, morally and
                    politically. Plus Becky
                    specifically asked me not to--

                                                         SMASH CUT TO:

          ALAN SITTING ON THE BANQUETTE, LOOKING AWESTRUCK
          as Chastity works a wildly erotic lapdance on him. She crawls
          onto his lap, she whips him with her long hair, she puts her
          tongue in his ear. Next to him, no longer getting lapdances,
          Vick and Stu just sit, staring at Chastity, entranced.

                              STU
                    I think I know why he married her.

                              VICK
                    Because if he hadn't, I would've.
          They continue watching on in silence.

                              STU
                    Is it weird that we're sitting this
                    close watching?

                              VICK
                    Not for me.
          More watching in silence.

          

                                                                     51.

          

          

                               STU
                    I really shouldn't be here. I have
                    daughters.
          Then both of their heads angle the same way.

                              VICK
                    Not that can do that.

                              STU
                    How can she do that without
                    dislocating her hip?

                              VICK
                    Because she's been touched by God.
          They continue staring, amazed. Just then, the door is kicked
          open and KIKIOLANI and KALOLO FANALUA burst into the
          Champagne Room, peering through the darkness, looking for our
          guys. Vick and Stu see them immediately.

                               VICK (CONT'D)
                    Shit.
          They both hop up. Alan remains sitting, however, hypnotized
          by Chastity. Vick grabs him.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Alan, come on, man, we gotta go!

                              ALAN
                    Whoa, whoa, I'm smelling the roses--
          Vick literally yanks Alan up from the banquette.

                              VICK
                    Come on, man! We got company!
          Finally, the Guamians spot the guys and lumber for them!

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Chastity, honey, is there a back
                    way out of here?!
          Thinking fast, Chastity grabs her clothes and darts over to
          a darkened, unlabeled FIRE DOOR.

                               CHASTITY
                    Come on!
          The guys race after her...

          

                                                                    52.

          

          

          INT. CRAZY HORSE -- BACK HALLWAY

          Chastity and the guys sprint through the bright, crowded back
          hallways of the Crazy Horse, weaving through strippers,
          cocktail waitresses, and barbacks.
          Behind them, the two massive Samoans try to follow, but are
          slowed by all the foot traffic. Strippers SCREAM as they're
          bowled over by the obese Islanders.

          INT. CRAZY HORSE -- MAIN STAGE

          A spotlight holds on a CLOSED CURTAIN covering the main
          stage. Some sort of techno Limp Bizkit song is playing.

                              STRIPPER D.J. (O.S.)

                    ANNND ON STAGE ONE, PUT YOUR HANDS

                    TOGETHER FOR...DOUBLE STAXXX!
          All the patrons turn their attention to Stage One -- then Stu
          blows through the curtain, out of breath. Beat. The patrons
          look at Stu, confused. Stu looks at them, equally so.
          The patrons start to BOOO, just as Vick, Chastity, and Alan
          blow through the curtain after Stu.

                               CHASTITY
                    Come on!
          Chastity, in six inch leucite heels, sprints down the main
          runway, leaps over the patrons sitting at the end, and hits
          the floor running!

                              STU
                    Did she just do that in heels?!

                              VICK
                    I'm really starting to like this
                    girl.
          The guys all follow suit, sprinting down the runway and
          leaping over the patrons!
          Then the Guamians blow through the curtain, panting, very
          upset. They lumber down the stage -- and the patrons at the
          end of the runway clear the hell out of the way.

          CHASTITY AND THE GUYS RACE THROUGH THE STRIP CLUB
          Upsetting cocktails, hopping onto stages and then off again,
          leaping over chairs, spinning around stripper poles, and,
          finally, sprinting out the front door!

          

                                                                  53.

          

          
          The massive Guamians give chase, leaving a wide trail of
          destruction behind them, like two elephants trampling through
          a forest. Just as they're blowing out of the door, however,

          THEY'RE CLOTHESLINED BY TWO CHAIRS
          being swung into their chests! SMASH! They both stumble
          backwards, and then four roided-up STRIP CLUB SECURITY GUARDS
          pounce on them, wrestling them to the ground.

                              CRAZY HORSE SECURITY GUARD
                        (to walkie talkie)
                    Viper One, this is Rolling Thunder,
                    we've subdued the targets, over.

          EXT. CRAZY HORSE -- DAY

          Chastity and the guys hurry around the corner from the Crazy
          Horse, laughing, exhilarated from the chase.

                              STU
                    Did you see them trample those tiny
                    Japanese businessmen?! I think they
                    killed like four of them!
          Everyone laughs. Vick puts his arm around Alan.

                              VICK
                    Come on, Alan: tell me that wasn't
                    just a little fun...

                              ALAN
                    That was...a little fun.
          Vick smiles -- just as a LAS VEGAS POLICE CAR hops the curb,
          lights flashing, and cuts them off! Two mustachioed COPS get
          out and hurry for them, pointing, intense.

                              LAS VEGAS POLICEMAN
                    Victor Lennon?! Alan Mervish?!
                    Stuart Pryce?!

                              STU

                        (SCARED)
                    Y-Yes?!

                              LAS VEGAS POLICEMAN
                    You're coming with us.

                                                            CUT TO:

          

                                                                  54.

          

          

          INT. LAS VEGAS POLICE STATION -- INTERROGATION ROOM -- DAY

          The two LVPD cops, OFFICER MERRIWEATHER and OFFICER BLADEN,
          40's, pace about this bare interrogation room, while Vick,
          Alan and Stu sit behind the cold metal table.
          Vick looks tense, but in control. Stu and Alan are sweating,
          terrified. They've clearly been here a while.

                              OFFICER MERRIWEATHER
                    Where were you last night at 3am?

                               VICK
                    No idea.

                              OFFICER BLADEN
                    Okay, how about at 2am?

                               VICK
                    Ditto.
          Officer Bladen SLAMS the table with his fist.

                              OFFICER MERRIWEATHER
                    You think this is cute, son?! You
                    think this is a game?!

                              ALAN
                    Whatever we did, we're so sorry!

                              STU
                    Honestly, man, I will confess to
                    anything you want!

                               VICK
                    Stu: stop talking. Alan: sit up
                    straight. Officer Merriweather,
                    I've told you twelve times now: we
                    have no memory of last night. Now
                    either charge us with a crime, or
                    let us go.
          Merriweather scowls and nods at Bladen, who steps over to a
          TELEVISION and turns it on. Merriweather, meanwhile, pulls
          out a photograph of a slick ASIAN MAN in a red suit, slides
          it onto the table.

                              OFFICER MERRIWEATHER
                    What do you know about Jimmy Lang?
          Vick flinches ever-so-slightly, clearly knowing something.
          Stu and Alan just look at the photograph, confused.

          

                                                                    55.

          

          

                                  ALAN
                     Nothing?

                                  STU
                     Who is he?

                               OFFICER MERRIWEATHER
                     Jimmy Lang runs the infamous Shiang-
                     Xi crime organization, and is
                     wanted in seven states for money
                     laundering, drug smuggling,
                     racketeering and murder.

                               ALAN
                     Oh my god--

                               STU
                     Did we kill someone last night--?!

                               VICK
                     We have no idea who this man is.

                               OFFICER MERRIWEATHER
                     Is that right?

                               VICK
                     Yeah, that's right.
          ON THE TELEVISION, grainy surveillance camera footage of a
          birthday party starts playing. In the video, JIMMY LANG sits
          in an upscale restaurant, in front of a BIRTHDAY CAKE, as a
          table full of hip ASIAN GUYS serenade him with "Happy
          Birthday To You."
          When the guys sitting next to Jimmy lean forward to help him
          blow out the candles on his cake, however, we see that it's
          Vick, ALAN, STU, DOUG, and some BLACK GUY, all very drunk!

                               VICK & ALAN & STU & DOUG (ON TAPE)

                     HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR JIMMMMY, HAPPY

                     BIRTHDAY TOOO YOOOOU!
          Everyone applauds. Vick drunkenly hugs Jimmy Lang.

                               VICK (ON TAPE)
                     I love you, Jimmy Lang!
          Merriweather FREEZES FRAME on Vick kissing the top of Jimmy
          Lang's shaved head.
          In the interrogation room, Vick, Stu and Alan sit, frozen.
          Silence.

          

                                                          56.

          

          

                              STU
                    We're in a lot of trouble, aren't
                    we.

                              ALAN
                    Officers, I swear, we have no
                    memory of that ever occurring--

                              OFFICER BLADEN
                    Okay. Maybe a night in jail will
                    jostle something loose.

                              STU
                    Oh no, sir, please don't!

                              ALAN
                    We have a very important wedding--!

                              VICK
                    I know Jimmy Lang.
          Everyone stops, looks at Vick.

                               ALAN
                    You do?!

                              VICK
                    Jimmy and I tried to raise capital
                    for Girl-nasium, a 24 hour fitness
                    center and day spa for tween-age
                    girls, but it never got off the
                    ground. It was an entirely
                    legitimate enterprise -- I had no
                    idea he was a criminal. We must've
                    bumped into him last night, and he
                    must've invited us to join his
                    birthday celebration. No crime in
                    that, is there, Officers?
          Merriweather gets in Vick's face, intense.

                               OFFICER MERRIWEATHER
                    You actually expect me to believe
                    that dung?

                              VICK

                        (UNBLINKING)
                    Yes, Officer Merriweather. I do.

                              OFFICER MERRIWEATHER
                    If I find out you're lying to me,
                    son, I will take all of you down,
                    is that clear?

          

                                                                     57.

          

          

                               OFFICER BLADEN
                    You boys wouldn't last three hours
                    in prison.

                                 VICK
                    Stu might.
          Stu shakes his head, unbelievable.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Now: are you gonna charge us with
                    something, or are we free to go?
          The cops look at each other, scowling. Beat.

                              OFFICER BLADEN
                    Get outta here.
          Stu and Alan quickly hop to their feet and make for the door.

                              ALAN
                    Oh, thank you, Officers!

                              STU
                    It was really nice meeting you--!

                              OFFICER MERRIWEATHER
                    If you know what's good for you,
                    you'll get the hell out of Vegas.

                                                            CUT TO:

          EXT. LAS VEGAS POLICE STATION -- NIGHT

          Day has turned to night. Vick, Stu, and Alan descend the
          steps of the police station. The mood is grim.

                              ALAN
                    Did you have to be such a dick?!

                              VICK
                    We got out, didn't we?

                              ALAN
                    Yeah, four hours later! If we'd
                    just cooperated with them--

                              VICK
                    If we'd cooperated with them, we'd
                    be in jail right now, Alan.
          They reach the curb, and Stu starts trying to hail a cab.
          Desperation is setting in.

          

                                                          58.

          

          

                              ALAN
                    What are we gonna do now? We've got
                    zero leads on where Doug is!

                              STU
                    Why hasn't he called? It's 8:30.
          The guys shake their heads, I don't know.

                              STU (CONT'D)
                    Do you think he's okay--?

                              VICK
                    Stu, don't. Doug is fine.

                              STU
                    I mean, we were hanging out with
                    mobsters last night, man! They kill
                    people for looking at `em weird--!

                              VICK
                    Stu: Doug is fine.

                              STU
                    Or what if we like drove Doug out
                    to the desert and left him, just as
                    like a funny prank--?!

                              VICK
                    Stu! Enough!

                              ALAN

                        (MUTTERING)
                    I knew I shouldn't have come...

                              VICK
                    What did you just say?

                              ALAN
                    I said I knew I shouldn't have come
                    this weekend, Vick!

                              VICK
                        (getting heated)
                    Is that right?

                              ALAN
                    Yeah, that's right. I only came
                    because Doug insisted.
          Vick steps towards Alan, heated.

          

                                                          59.

          

          

                              VICK
                    Why do think you're so much better
                    than us, dude?!

                              ALAN
                    I don't -- I just think I'm better
                    than you, Vick! And trust me, it's
                    not that hard! You haven't changed
                    one bit since high school! Jesus,
                    you're 28 years old and you still
                    talk back to cops?! Really?!

                              VICK
                    You're out of your depth, Alan--

                              ALAN
                    And you're still the one getting us
                    in trouble! Only then it was hiding
                    your weed in our locker, and now
                    you've got us partying with wanted
                    felons! It's not cute anymore, man!
                    We're too old for this!
          Vick scowls; this is actually hitting home...

                              ALAN (CONT'D)
                    And all your stupid get-rich-quick
                    schemes?! Girl-nasium?! Custard?!
                    In Los Angeles?! Are you joking?!

                              STU
                    Okay, let's all take a breath--

                              ALAN
                    When's the last time you had a real
                    job, man?! When's the last time you
                    had a girlfriend?! Hell, when's the
                    last time you picked up the check?!

                              VICK
                    What's so great about any of those
                    things?!

                              ALAN
                    Those "things," Vick, are what
                    grown men do!
          Vick swallows, furious.

                              STU
                    Look, we're all tired and hungry--

          

                                                                    60.

          

          

                              VICK
                    None of us ever liked you, Alan! We
                    only hung out with you because Doug
                    made us!
          Alan recoils, whoa, stung. This is clearly news to him.

                              ALAN
                    Stu...? Is that true?
          Stu gestures, uncomfortable, enh, who's to say? Alan nods, I
          see, his face reddening.

                              VICK
                    Why would anyone like you, dude?
                    Have you ever thought about that?
                    You're uptight, you're judgemental,
                    you're cheap, and yet somehow you
                    think you're sweeter than everyone
                    else! Well look around, man: no one
                    wants to be you! I'd rather be Stu
                    than you!

                              STU
                    Wait, what--?
          Too late: Alan charges Vick and TACKLES him onto the lawn!
          They roll on the ground, trying to punch each other, but it
          ends up being a mess of half-chops, pulled hair, and hands in
          each other's faces...

                              ALAN
                    I've...always...hated you...

                              VICK
                    You punch like...your sister...
          Stu runs over and jumps in, trying to break them apart.

                              STU
                    Hey, no! Time out! We all need a
                    time out--!
          THUNK! Stu is accidentally kicked in the face and goes down.
          Alan and Vick continue rolling on the lawn, trying to beat
          the crap out of each other. They could be kids again. Then,
          just when it starts getting way too intense,

          A CAR HORN SOUNDS
          And all three of them look up to see Vick'S BEAT-UP CADILLAC
          parked on the curb, Chastity at the wheel.

          

                                                                   61.

          

          

                              CHASTITY
                    That might not be like, the
                    smartest place to fight?
          Vick and Alan look over at the huge LAS VEGAS POLICE
          DEPARTMENT sign right next to them. They frown...

                                                              CUT TO:

          EXT. THE COYOTE CANTINA -- NIGHT

          Vick's car sits parked in front of a country bar.

          INT. THE COYOTE CANTINA -- NIGHT

          The guys sit at a booth, their hair a mess, their faces
          bruised, their clothing ripped, ravenously chowing down on
          TACOS. Stu's mouth is full of food:

                              STU
                    Good call on happy hour, Chastity.
                    These tacos kick ass.

                              CHASTITY
                    Yeah, I always come here when I get
                    out of jail.
          The guys exchange a quick look.

                              ALAN
                    Hey -- how'd you start Vick's car?

                              CHASTITY
                    Oh, my daddy taught me how to
                    hotwire almost anything.

                              VICK
                    That's funny, because Alan's daddy
                    taught him tax law.
          Chastity smiles, a little confused. Alan is quick to retort:

                              ALAN
                    And Vick's daddy taught him how to
                    get really drunk at his kid's
                    soccer games and then piss himself.

                              VICK
                    It's a disease, dude--!

                              STU
                    Guys, come on! For Doug?

          

                                                                  62.

          

          
          Alan and Vick angrily continue eating their tacos. Then Stu's
          PHONE rings. He pulls it out, reads the caller ID.

                              STU (CONT'D)
                    "Number blocked."

                      VINCE                             ALAN               
          Don't answer it.                 Answer it.

                              ALAN
                    What if it's Doug?

                              VICK
                    What if it's Tracy?!

                              STU
                        (torn, answers phone)
                    Good evening, this is Stu!

          INTERCUT WITH:

          INT. VENICE BUNGALOW -- NIGHT

          It's Tracy. She's sitting in her living room, on the phone.
          Her STERN FATHER sits nearby, as do other FAMILY MEMBERS.

                              TRACY
                    Stu, it's Tracy!
          His eyes bulging, Stu covers the phone and hisses:

                              STU
                    It's Tracy!
          Vick glares at Alan. Alan looks away, shit.

                              STU (CONT'D)
                    Why is she calling me?!

                              VICK
                    Because she knows you're the most
                    easily tricked.

                              ALAN
                    We have tell her we lost Doug.

                              VICK
                    No we don't! Tell her nothing, Stu!
          Stu turns back to the phone, rattled.

                              STU
                    Hey, Trace! W-What's going on?

          

                                                63.

          

          

                    TRACY
          Oh, nothing, just here with my
          family...

                    STU
          Wow, that sounds amazing!

                    TRACY
          Yeah...? Hey, you wouldn't happen
          to know where Doug is, would you?
          He said he'd be home by 5 for this
          dinner, and now it's almost 9:00. I
          tried his cell, but he didn't
          answer...

                    STU
          Ummmm........Hang on.
              (covering the mouthpiece)
          She wants to know where Doug is!

                    VICK
          I'm working on it! Buy us some
          time!

                    ALAN
          No, just tell her the truth!
          Honesty is always the best policy!

                    VICK
          What are you, retarded?! Honesty is
          never the best policy! Especially
          not with brides!

                    STU
              (lamely, to phone)
          Um, what'd you say?

                    TRACY

              (FROWNING)
          I asked if you knew where Doug was.

                    STU
          Yeah, um, hang on.
              (to guys)
          She still wants to know!

                    VICK
          Okay: tell her Alan got really
          drunk last night and fell down, and
          the doctor said not to move him for
          a few hours, but that we'll be back
          in time for the wedding.

          

                                                            64.

          

          

                              ALAN
                    Why do I have to be the one that
                    fell over drunk?!

                              VICK
                    It's a fictitious canard, Alan, get
                    over yourself! Stu: tell her!

                              STU (TO PHONE)
                    Listen, Tracy, Alan fell on a

                    DOCTOR--

                              VICK
                    Fell over drunk.

                              STU
                    H-He was drunk. And the doctor -- a
                    different doctor, not the one he
                    fell on -- he said we couldn't move
                    him until the wedding--

                              VICK
                    For a few hours! We'll be home
                    before the wedding!

                              STU
                    But we're going to have the wedding
                    at your home--
          Tracy just looks really confused.
          Exasperated, Vick rips the phone away from Stu.

                              VICK
                    Tracy?! Vick! How are ya, hon?

                              TRACY
                        (now very concerned)
                    Vick, what is going on?

                              VICK
                    Nothing! Stu is a moron. Listen,
                    Alan hurt his back last night, so
                    we're gonna be laid up here for a
                    bit, but I promise we'll have Doug
                    home in time for the wedding, okay?

                              TRACY
                    Oh God, is Alan all right?

          

                                                                  65.

          

          

                              VICK
                    Yes, luckily he had a steel rod
                    surgically implanted up his ass at
                    birth, so the doctors anticipate a
                    complete and swift recovery.
          Alan flips him the bird.

                              TRACY
                    Can I talk to Doug?

                              VICK
                    What? No! No, you can't actually,
                    Doug...Doug is out.

                              TRACY
                    Where is he?

                              VICK
                    Where is he? He's aaaat...the
                    pharmacy. Yeah, picking up Alan's
                    medications. Listen, Trace, I'm
                    losing you, but we'll see you
                    tomorrow, okay? Bye, sweetie--!
          Vick hangs up and nods confidently.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    She bought it.

                                                            CUT TO:

          INT. VENICE BUNGALOW -- NIGHT

          Back in her bungalow, Tracy hangs up the phone, frowning.

                              TRACY
                    They've done something stupid.
          Her stern father is standing there, frowning.

                              MR. TURNER
                    No surprise there.

                              TRACY

                    DAD--

                              MR. TURNER
                    I'm just saying, what kind of man
                    stands up his fiancée the night
                    before their wedding?

          

                                                                   66.

          

          

                              TRACY
                    Dad, I don't want to hear it. I
                    trust Doug absolutely.
          Mr. Turner backs off. Tracy, however, looks a bit rattled...

                                                         CUT BACK TO:

          INT. THE COYOTE CANTINA -- NIGHT

          The guys get up from the booth and head for the door, grim.

                              ALAN
                    Perfect. We just told Tracy we'd
                    have Doug home in 13 hours, and we
                    still have no idea where he is...
          They pass a DOORMAN on their way out, who's standing with a
          stamp and a UV light reader.

                              DOORMAN
                    Handstamp for re-entry?
                    Handstamp for re-entry?
          Everyone waves, no thanks -- except for Stu, who shrugs, why
          not, and stops, holding out his hand.

                              VICK
                    Maybe we should go back to the
                    hotel and--

                              STU
                    Oh my God, guys! Look!
          Stu holds his hand under the UV light -- it's covered in
          STAMPS from all the clubs they've been to the night before!
          Stu yanks up his sleeve to reveal his ENTIRE FOREARM GLOWS,
          completely covered with stamps!
          The guys hurry back and slide their forearms under the UV
          light, too: they all have the same stamps! Their eyes alight:

                              ALAN
                    It's like a map of last night!
          The guys look at each other, hope returning to their faces!

                                                             CUT TO:

          TITLE CARD: "SATURDAY, 9:10PM"

          EXT. LAS VEGAS/INT. VICK'S CAR -- NIGHT

          The guys rocket down the Strip, weaving in and out of
          traffic! All the stamps on Stu's arm are now labelled in
          regular ink. MUSIC blares, and the mood is high.

                              STU
                    Where do you want to start?!

                              VICK
                    At the top! We hit every club we
                    went to til someone remembers what
                    we did with Doug!

                              ALAN
                    Nice clue, Stuey! I can't believe
                    we're actually gonna pull this off!
          Stu grins over at the car next to them. Then he stops.

                              STU
                    Hey: is that guy wearing Doug's
                    hat?!
          The guys look over to see that the DRIVER of the next car
          over is, in fact, wearing the DISTINCTIVE FEDORA-STYLE HAT
          Doug was wearing last night. The guy turns off the Strip.

                              VICK
                    Naaah, couldn't be.

                              ALAN
                    Lots of people have hats like that.
          Stu nods, yeah, I guess...

          TIGHT ON: STU'S HAND
          The first bar written on it is "GhostBar."

                                                         MATCH CUT TO:

          INT. GHOSTBAR -- NIGHT

          Chastity and the guys blow in, each with a photo of Doug (in
          medieval armor) from Alan's wedding. As they move into the
          club, every single waiter, bartender, and busboy sees them
          and throws open their arms, heyyyy, remembering them!
          They flash the picture of Doug to anyone who'll look --
          waiters, maitre d's, thugs, bachelorettes, fetishists,
          bikers, swingers, brides and grooms -- but all of them shake
          their heads, we have no idea where Doug is...

          

                                                                     68.

          

          

          INT. VICK'S CAR -- NIGHT

          Stu crosses off "GhostBar" from his arm...

          INT. BODY ENGLISH NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT

          The guys and Chastity enter and disperse. Again, everyone
          recognizes them and hugs them like returning heroes -- and
          again, no one remembers where they were taking Doug...

          INT. VICK'S CAR -- NIGHT

          Stu crosses off another stamp from his arm...

          EXT. PURE NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT

          The BOUNCER recognizes the guys from the night before and
          unclips the rope, letting them in past the immense line...

          INT. TAO NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT

          The BOUNCER recognizes the guys from the night before and
          unclips the rope, letting them in past the immense line...

          INT. ICE NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT

          The BOUNCER recognizes the guys from the night before and
          unclips the rope, letting them in past the immense line...

          INT. VICK'S CAR -- NIGHT

          The guys race through a shadier, more industrial area of
          town, their hopes dimming...

                              STU
                    All right, this is the last place
                    we went, "Chaps."
          Vick rolls to a stop in front of...

          CHAPS NIGHTCLUB
          It takes a moment for the guys to realize that everyone in
          line is male, buff, and wearing erotic cowboy gear.

                              STU
                    You sure we came here...?
          Then they look up at the marquee. It reads "CHAPS: HOME OF

          THE GOLDEN PONY ALL MALE REVUE."

                              ALAN
                    The Golden Pony. That's us.

          

                                                                  69.

          

          

                              STU
                    Maybe I'll just wait in the car--
          But Vick is already shoving Stu out of the car.

          INT. CHAPS NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT

          The guys walk into the massive nightclub and stop. It's got a
          kitschy barn theme, and hosts 200 TOPLESS DUDES in cowboy
          hats and short-shorts grinding on each other.

                              VICK
                    You think we would've remembered
                    this...

                              STU
                    Yeah, I don't think we came here...

                              ALAN
                    Then why is your underwear nailed
                    to the wall?
          The guys turn to see numerous pairs of MEN'S UNDERWEAR nailed
          to the wall nearby. A sign above it reads "CHAPS WALL OF
          FAME." We recognize Stu's COLORADO STATE BOXERS.

                              STU
                    Those could be anybody's. Thousands
                    of people go to Colorado State--

                              ALAN
                        (looking more closely)
                    Oh my God, are they autographed?

                              VICK

                        (READING)
                    "Stu Pryce, 9/30/08. I     Chaps!"

          

                              STU
                        (realizing, stunned)
                    I am so gay...
          Just then, a BUFF WAITER in assless chaps blows by, smiling.

                              WAITER
                    Hey, guys! Roger is backstage!
          The guys look at each other, eyes wide.

                               STU
                    R-Roger?

          

                                                                  70.

          

          

          INT. CHAPS -- DANCE FLOOR

          The guys move through the throng of undulating, sweaty men,
          uncomfortable. Alan takes Chastity's hand tightly.

                              ALAN
                    Stay very close to me.
          She smiles and dances through the crowd.

          INT. CHAPS -- BACKSTAGE AREA

          They reach a HUGE MALE BOUNCER guarding the backstage area.
          He sees the guys and unclips the VELVET ROPE, kissing each of
          them on the cheek as they pass.

                              BOUNCER
                    How are Haylee and Kaitlin?

                              STU
                        (totally disturbed)
                    Oh. G-Good, thanks...?

          INT. BACKSTAGE AREA -- DRESSING ROOM DOOR

          The guys reach the dressing room door and stop. They inhale.

                              VICK
                    We're going to love you either way,
                    Stu...
          Stu nods, focussed, nervous, like before a big game.

                              ALAN
                    Some of my best friends are gay.

                              STU
                    Is that true?

                              ALAN
                    Not...not really? I live in
                    Connecticut, man, we don't even
                    have black people yet.
          Stu nods, right. Then, after steeling himself, he enters...

          INT. CHAPS -- DRESSING ROOM

          The dressing room is packed with muscular, tan, buck-naked
          men, walking around, rubbing baby oil on themselves, donning
          chaps and codpieces, getting ready for the next show.

          

                                                                    71.

          

          
          Chastity and the guys move through the mob of beefcake,
          staying ridiculously close together. Vick stops at one
          dancer, trying not to look down at his junk:

                              VICK
                    Excuse me, friend, can you tell me
                    where Roger is?

                              BEEFCAKE COWBOY
                    Oh, hey, Vick! Roger's over there.
          He points to a really hot, really naked guy with a funky
          mullet, stretching out in front of his mirror. The guys
          shuffle over to him. Vick tries to be supportive with Stu:

                              VICK
                    He's cute...I guess...?
          Stu shrugs, yeah, I guess...? As they draw close, Roger sees
          them, and smiles.

                              ROGER
                    Oh! Hey guys!
          He hugs all of them. The guys make sure to keep their asses
          arched back to avoid genital contact.

                              ROGER (CONT'D)
                    I'm surprised you're even walking
                    yet, Stu.

                               STU
                        (inhaling sharply)
                    Oh my god.

                              VICK
                    Listen, man, we don't really
                    remember what happened last night,
                    can you fill us in?

                              ROGER
                    Really? No memory?
          Stu shakes his head, wide-eyed, scared...

                              ROGER (CONT'D)
                    Well, I must say, Stu, I'm a little
                    hurt.

                              STU
                    Did we...you know...do anything?

                              ROGER
                    Well, duh? Yeah?

          

                                                                    72.

          

          
          The guys all freeze. A beat. Then Vick pats Stu's shoulder,
          supportive.

                              STU
                    Was I...the boy or the girl?

                              ROGER
                    Oh, honey, you were everything.
          Stu WHIMPERS. Vick and Alan exchange a look, holy shit!

                              ROGER (CONT'D)
                    But you were nothing like Vick.

                              VICK
                    Wait-- what?!

                              ROGER
                    I know, I'm sort of over group
                    stuff too, but Alan insisted.
          Now it's Alan's turn to look stunned.

                              VICK
                    You insisted?! Why'd you insist?!

                              ALAN
                    I don't know! I don't know why I
                    insisted!

                              ROGER
                    Actually, after the anger went
                    away, it was really quite tender.
          The guys look at each other, nauseous.

                              STU
                    I'm really not sure we can be
                    friends anymore...
          Finally, Chastity starts LAUGHING.

                              CHASTITY
                    Guys: he's kidding.
          Roger breaks into a smile and slaps five with Chastity. The
          guys all exhale, incredibly relieved.

                              VICK
                    Not cool, Roger. Not cool.

                              ALAN
                    So what did happen last night?

          

                                                                  73.

          

          

                              ROGER
                    Oh, well, you guys came in near the
                    end of our last set, like 2ish.
                    Doug pretty much dragged you in.

                              ALAN
                    Really? Doug did?

                              ROGER
                    Oh no, my Doug, not your Doug.
                    Black guy, shaved head?
          The guys look at each other, confused.

                              ROGER (CONT'D)
                    He's a cake designer, he said he
                    met you guys at some sort of
                    birthday party at the Rio?

                              VICK
                        (snapping his finger)
                    The guy from the Jimmy Lang
                    surveillance video.
          The guys nod, right.

                              ROGER
                    Anyway, for the big finale of our
                    show, we always bring someone on
                    stage, and, well, Stu, you
                    volunteered pretty aggressively.
                        (to nearby dancer)
                    Hey Dallas, do we have the video of
                    last night's show?

                              STU
                    No! That's cool, I don't need to
                    see it--

                              VICK
                    We must see that video.

                              DALLAS
                    It's in the machine.
          Roger nods and presses PLAY on a little VCR/TV combo sitting
          in front of his mirror. ON THE TV a very Brokeback,
          Chippendale's-style male revue starts playing. Stu GASPS.
          Roger fast forwards.

          

                                                                  74.

          

          

                              ROGER
                    You were pretty mellow at first,
                    Stu, but once we got you into the
                    chaps, you really came alive-- oh,
                    here it is.

          
          ON THE TV we see Stu, wearing only his "I    ROGER" g-string
          and assless chaps, grinding on stage with the Golden Pony
          dancers. He is way fatter, paler, and hairier than the
          greased young studs. The guys look away, oooo.

                              STU
                    I'm a Dad, I-I don't get to the gym
                    as much as I'd like...

                              ROGER
                    You even taught us The Pony, which
                    we'd never even heard of before...
          ON THE TV Stu gets on all fours on the stage, and eagerly
          gestures for the dancers to take turns "riding" him.
          Stu's face drops.

                               ROGER (CONT'D)
                    And then, of course, the pièce de
                    resistance: the Ride of the
                    Valkyries.
          ON THE VIDEO Stu clutches onto Roger from behind as they ride
          a LAVENDER MECHANICAL BULL together. The crowd goes wild.

                              STU
                    Annnnd that would explain the
                    searing ass pain.

                              ROGER
                    After the show, we split a couple
                    pitchers of flirtinis, you had our
                    stylist cut your hair like mine,
                    and then you split.

                              VICK
                    And what time was all this?

                              ROGER
                    4:30 in the morning? 4:45?

                              ALAN
                    And our Doug was with us?

          

                                                                   75.

          

          

                              ROGER
                    Yeah, he had passed out by then,
                    but you carried him out. It was all
                    very Officer And A Gentleman.
          The guys look at each other, confused.

                              ALAN
                    Wait, so we left with Doug at 4:45,
                    we got back to the hotel at 5:00,
                    and Doug was gone by 5:30 when
                    Chastity met back up with us?

                              STU
                    That doesn't make any sense.

                              VICK
                    Did we lose him along the way?

                              STU
                    He was passed out, how far could he
                    have gone--?
          Just then, Vick's cellphone rings. The caller ID reads
          "MANDALAY BAY." He answers:

                              VICK
                    Hello?

          INTERCUT WITH:

          INT. MANDALAY BAY -- NIGHT

          Atashir is on the phone at the reception desk.

                              ATASHIR
                    Mr. Lennon?

                              VICK
                    Atashir, many greetings to you.

                               ATASHIR
                    I thought you might like to know
                    that one of our maids just found
                    your friend, Douglas, passed out in
                    your room.
          Vick's jaw drops.

                              VICK
                    What?! Are you sure it's him?!

          

                                                                  76.

          

          

                              ATASHIR
                    I saw him with my own eyes. He is
                    unconscious but breathing nicely.

                              VICK
                    Oh thank you, Atashir! You are a
                    man of great honor! A thousand
                    blessings upon your ancestors!
          Vick SLAMS his phone shut, overjoyed.

                               VICK (CONT'D)
                    Doug is in the room! A maid just
                    found him! He's passed out, but
                    he's okay!

                              STU
                    They're sure it's him?!

                              VICK
                    Atashir swears it is!
          The guys all laugh, a massive weight lifted.

                              STU
                    Oh thank God he's okay...

                              ALAN
                    After all this?! He's in the room?!
          They keep laughing and hug each other, heartfelt. Vick even
          hugs Roger.

                              VICK
                    I don't even care! Hug me, you big
                    shiny homosexual!

          EXT. CHAPS -- NIGHT

          Chastity and the guys bound out of Chaps, jubilant. Stu is
          carrying a box of TWO DOZEN VIDEOTAPES.

                              ALAN
                    That was cool of Roger to give you
                    all the tapes of your performance.

                              STU
                    I know, if I actually was gay, I'd
                    totally date Roger first. What a
                    gentle soul.
          They get into Vick's clunker.

          

                                                                   77.

          

          

                              VICK
                    How we doing on time?

                              ALAN
                        (looking at watch)

                    2:22.

                              VICK
                    We'll be in LA by dawn.
                        (firing up engine)
                    I told you bitches this would all
                    work out...
          They drive off into the night, grins all around.

          EXT. THE STRIP/INT. VICK'S CAR -- NIGHT

          Vick drives, Stu sits shotgun. Alan sits in the back with
          Chastity. The cool night air washes over them. They look
          happily exhausted.

                              ALAN
                    This has officially been the
                    craziest weekend of my life.
                        (to Chastity)
                    Thanks for all your help. You were
                    awesome.

                              CHASTITY
                    Anything for my hubby.
          Alan's smile flickers slightly.

                              CHASTITY (CONT'D)
                    I'm kidding, Alan. I know last
                    night wasn't, you know, real...
          She looks out at Vegas as it flies by.

                              ALAN
                    I'm sorry about all this, Chastity.

                                CHASTITY
                    Jennifer.

                              ALAN
                    Beg pardon?

                              CHASTITY
                    My name is Jennifer. Jennifer Elly.
          Alan hesitates; suddenly she seems a lot more...human.

          

                                                                  78.

          

          

                              ALAN
                    Okay, well, I'm sorry, Jennifer.

                              CHASTITY
                    Oh, don't be. Last night wasn't the
                    first flaky decision I've ever made
                    in my life. I mean, I am a
                    stripper.
          Alan tries not to laugh. She smiles, a twinge sadly.

                              ALAN
                    Where you from?

                              CHASTITY
                    LA. Tarzana.

                               ALAN
                    Oh yeah?

                              CHASTITY
                    Yeah. I work here on the weekends.

                              ALAN
                    You fly out every week?

                              CHASTITY
                    Yeah. I'd move, but my kid is in a
                    great school.

                               ALAN
                    Kid?

                              VICK
                        (aside, to Stu)
                    They always have kids.

                              CHASTITY
                    I have a little girl, Sarah.
                    She's... Well, she's everything.
          Chastity proudly shows Alan a photo from her purse of a cute
          little toddler. Alan smiles.

                              CHASTITY (CONT'D)
                    What about you?

                              ALAN
                    No kids. Same girlfriend for 14
                    years. Becky.
          Alan shows her a photo of Becky on his cellphone.

          

                                                               79.

          

          

                              CHASTITY
                    Wow, she's stunning.
          Stu turns around, unable to keep quiet any longer:

                              STU
                    We like you way better.

                              ALAN

                    STU!
          Chastity tries to stymie her laugh.

                              ALAN (CONT'D)
                    Becky is great.

                              STU
                    Becky collects teapots.

                              VICK
                    Yeah, she's a total canwego.

                              CHASTITY
                    A what?

                              VICK
                    You know, she's the girl at the
                    party who's always like "Can we go?
                    Can we go?"
          Chastity laughs. Alan does too, shaking his head.

                              ALAN
                    She has low blood sugar.

                              STU
                    She has low fun sugar.

                              ALAN
                    Jesus, guys! This is the girl I'm
                    going to marry!
                        (beat, considers)
                    If, you know...she forgives me for
                    cheating on her...

                              VICK
                    Wait: you're going to tell her?

                              ALAN
                    Of course I'm going to tell her! I
                    could never keep something like
                    that from her.

          

                                                                     80.

          

          

                              VICK
                    Dude, she still hasn't forgiven me
                    for scratching her Queensryche CD
                    in sixth grade -- she's neeeeever
                    gonna forgive you for marrying a
                    stripper in Vegas.

                              ALAN
                    Well, then that's just the price
                    I'm going to have to pay.
          Alan looks off, stoic. Chastity pats his hand, proud.

                              CHASTITY
                    Good for you.
          She smiles at Alan, impressed, pulling her hair from her
          face. Alan looks at her anew... It's a sweet moment...

                              VICK
                    She's gonna cut your dick off,
                    dude.

                                                            CUT TO:

          EXT. MANDALAY BAY -- NIGHT

          Lamborghini's, Ferrari's and Hummer limos clog the valet
          stand. Vick rolls up in his clunker. The guys hop out.

                              VICK
                        (to the valet)
                    Keep `er close, Paco. We'll be
                    right back.

          INT. MANDALAY BAY -- HALLWAY -- NIGHT

          Chastity and the guys hurry down the hallway to their suite.
          Vick unlocks their door and pushes inside.

                              VICK
                    Doug! Wake up, man!

          INT. DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- NIGHT

          Instead of finding Doug, however, they find KALOLO FANALUA,
          sitting on their couch, pissed. He's got a huge WHITE CAST on
          his right arm, courtesy of the strip club bouncers.

                              KALOLO FANALUA
                    Aloha, assholes.
          The guys freeze.

          

                                                                  81.

          

          

                                STU
                    Uh-oh.
          The door SLAMS behind them, and they whip around to see
          KIKIOLANI standing in front of the door, blocking their exit.
          He has an identical CAST on his right arm.

                                STU (CONT'D)
                    Not good.
          Just then, a toilet FLUSHES and an immensely large man in a
          red suit exits the bathroom, drying his hands. We recognize
          him from his police photo as crime boss JIMMY LANG, 50's.

                              JIMMY LANG
                    Oh, hello. Good to see you again.

                              VICK
                    Where is Doug?

                              ALAN
                    Listen, Mr. Lang, whatever we did
                    last night, we are incredibly sorry-

                              JIMMY LANG
                    These your rich friends you were
                    telling me about, Vick?
          Alan and Stu glance at Vick, confused.

                              JIMMY LANG (CONT'D)
                    Oh, you haven't told them yet?
                    Really, that's low. Even for you.

                              ALAN
                    What's going on, Vick?
          Vick stammers, trying to find the words...

                              JIMMY LANG
                    Six months ago, your friend Vick
                    borrowed some money from me at what
                    can only be described as a very
                    unfavorable interest rate. When the
                    loan came due, he failed to pay me
                    back, but he promised me that he
                    could get the money from you guys
                    this weekend.
          Alan and Stu look at Vick, shocked and hurt.

                              ALAN
                    Jesus, Vick...

          

                                                                  82.

          

          

                              STU
                    How could you do this to us, man?
                    We're your best friends...
          Vick looks away, ashamed.

                              VICK
                    They were gonna hurt me, man...

                              JIMMY LANG
                    Well, Vick, it looks like you and
                    your friends have some issues to
                    discuss. In the meantime...
          He draws a huge, red-plated .357 MAGNUM.

                              JIMMY LANG (CONT'D)
                    I need my goddamn money.
          The guys jump back, whoa! Vick holds up his hands:

                              VICK
                    I can get it! I can! I just--

                              JIMMY LANG
                    I've heard that before, Vick,
                    including last night, when you so
                    rudely skipped out on my birthday
                    party. That's why I've taken some
                    collateral to ensure your payment.
                    His name is Doug.
          The guys all look sick.

                              VICK
                    You have Doug?

                              STU
                    Oh my God...

                              JIMMY LANG
                    If you want your friend to live,
                    meet me at mile marker 26 off
                    Highway 12 at dawn, and bring the
                    money. Are we clear?

                                VICK
                    Yes! Yes.
          Jimmy nods and heads for the door. The Samoans follow him.

                              ALAN
                    M-M-Mr. Lang?

          

                                                                   83.

          

          

                              JIMMY LANG
                    Yes, Mr. Mervish?

                              ALAN
                    H-How much does Vick owe?

                                                              CUT TO:

                              ALAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    200 thousand dollars?!

          INT. THE DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- MOMENTS LATER

          Alan and Stu pace about the suite, beyond stressed. Vick
          stands, looking out the window. Chastity gets them all water.

                              ALAN
                    How the hell could you blow that
                    kind of money?!

                              STU
                    Was it for the custard store?

                              ALAN
                    Jesus, Stu, wake up! There is no
                    custard store! Vick was just trying
                    to rip us off to pay back Jimmy
                    Lang!

                              STU
                    Is that true, Vick?
          Vick just stares out at the city, not denying it.

                              STU (CONT'D)
                    Were any of your deals...real?

                              VICK

                        (GUILTY)
                    Some.
          Stu drops onto the couch, deeply disillusioned...

                              STU
                    Dude, I manage an Applebee's, that
                    money meant something to me...
          Vick spins around, furious:

                              VICK
                    Do you really think I wanted my
                    life to turn out like this, Stu?!
                    Do you really think I don't know
                    that I'm a massive loser?!

                              (MORE)

          

                                                                   84.

          

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Jesus, you guys got out of high
                    school and you just knew what to
                    do, you went to college and got
                    good jobs and found cool wives and
                    made beautiful children -- what do
                    I have to show for the last decade
                    of my life?! Nothing!
          Vick swats a lamp off a nearby end-table -- it SMASHES
          against the wall!
          The guys freeze. Tense silence. Vick grows emotional.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Jesus, I'm almost 30, and the only
                    thing I really have...the only
                    thing I really have is you guys.

                              STU
                    Come on, Vick--

                              VICK
                    No, man, it's true! I put on a good
                    show, but my life is so goddamn
                    hollow and vapid and lonely, it
                    scares me, man. I-I don't know how
                    much longer I can keep this scam
                    going. And now I've gone and ruined
                    the one good thing I had...
          Tears threaten in his eyes. He wipes at them, angry.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Just...please don't give up on me,
                    okay? I-I don't know what I'd do
                    without you guys. I really don't...
          Alan and Stu exchange a look. They've never seen brash, cocky
          Vick this vulnerable before. Stu can't help but give in.

                              STU
                    Come on, man, we've been bro's
                    since third grade, it's gonna take
                    a lot more than money to ruin our
                    friendship.
          Vick looks down, deeply touched...

                              STU (CONT'D)
                    What I don't understand is why you
                    didn't just ask me for the money. I
                    would've given you every last cent
                    I had, man...

          

                                                                  85.

          

          
          Tears trail down Vick's cheeks. He crosses and gives Stu a
          hug. Stu hugs back, emotional.

                              STU (CONT'D)
                    I love you, man.

                              VICK
                    Love you too, bro. Love you too.
          They hug tight. For a while.

                              STU
                    Also, I banged your sister
                    sophomore year.
          Vick pulls away.

                              VICK
                    What?!

                              STU
                    Sorry. Just seemed like a good time
                    to tell you.
          Vick stammers at Stu, speechless.

                              STU (CONT'D)
                    She had just broken up with that
                    guy from Central, we were playing
                    "I Never" at Tim Donahee's pool,
                    one thing lead to another--

                              VICK
                    No! No. That's...that's plenty.
          Vick desperately tries to clear the image from his mind. Alan
          just frowns at his watch, stressed.

                              ALAN
                    Look, I'm glad we're all sharing,
                    but we've got three hours to come
                    up with 200 grand, or else...
          The guys nod, frowning, back on point.

                              ALAN (CONT'D)
                    I'd offer to take a loan out, but
                    it's 3 o'clock in the morning, I'm
                    pretty sure my bank is closed.

                              STU
                    I think I can get a 20 grand cash
                    advance on my credit card...

          

                                                                     86.

          

          

                              ALAN
                    So that just leaves 180 grand...
          The guys frown at each other.

                              CHASTITY
                    Well, it is Vegas...
          The guys' eyebrows all rise, you think...?

                                                       SMASH CUT TO:

          ALAN THROWING DOWN BLACKJACK AT A BLACKJACK TABLE
          The guys erupt in CHEERS around him, YAAA! The dealer slides
          over a large pile of CHIPS.

                                                              CUT TO:

          CHASTITY THROWING CRAPS AT A CRAPS TABLE
          Again the guys erupt! Alan hugs Chastity. Their pile of CHIPS
          grows...

                                                              CUT TO:

          STU YELLING "BINGO" AT A BINGO TABLE
          The guys jump up, slapping ten, YELLING! Stu points at a
          table full of OLD LADIES nearby: in your face!

                                                              CUT TO:

          ALAN, STU, VICK AND CHASTITY SITTING AT A PAI GOW TABLE
          looking lost. Then they take their large stack of chips and
          quietly leave. No one knows how to play Pai Gow poker.

                                                              CUT TO:

          VICK JUMPING UP FROM A WAR TABLE
          having just won! Chastity and the guys aggressively hug him.
          Stu drinks from his glass, hands shaking, wired.

                              STU
                    Time check!

                              VICK
                        (looking at watch)
                    12 minutes.

                              STU
                    Chip check!

          

                                                                      87.

          

          
          Alan quickly counts the chips...

                              STU (CONT'D)
                    Faster! Come on chip check!

                              VICK
                    Dude, how many Red Bulls have you
                    had?

                              STU
                    I stopped counting at six! I can
                    hear my heart beating in my head!
          Alan finishes counting the chips -- and frowns.

                              ALAN
                    Just over 100 grand.
          The guys wince, damn.

                              VICK
                    There's only one thing left to do.
          They all exchange a knowing look...

                                                           SMASH CUT TO:

          $100,000 WORTH OF CHIPS BEING PLACED ON BLACK
          at a roulette table. The guys sweat, tense. Stu is insane.

                              STU
                    You sure we don't want red?! What
                    if the ball lands on red--!

                              VICK
                    Shut up, Stu.

                              ROULETTE CROUPIER
                    Betting is closed.
          The Croupier drops the ball into the wheel. It bounces, hops,
          spins... Vick crosses himself. Stu looks away.

                              STU
                    I can't watch! My   heart's gonna
                    explode! Can your   heart even
                    explode?! Because   I think my heart
                    is gonna explode!   I can't watch!
          The ball lands. Dead silence.

          

                                                                    88.

          

          

                              STU (CONT'D)
                    It's red, isn't it?! I knew it!
                    Tell me it's not red!

                              ALAN
                    It's not red...
          Stu turns, ecstatic--

                              ALAN (CONT'D)
                    It's green.
          The ball has stopped on green, DOUBLE ZERO. Stu clutches his
          chest, like he's having a seizure. Vick inhales, grim. Alan
          slowly drops to his knees. Chastity closes her eyes.
          Their HUGE PILE OF CHIPS is raked off the table...

                                                               CUT TO:

          EXT. MANDALAY BAY -- PARKING CIRCLE -- PRE-DAWN

          The guys pack their bags into Vick's beat-up Caddy. The mood
          is as dark as the pre-dawn sky. When the car is loaded,
          Chastity takes Alan's hands, gentle.

                              CHASTITY
                    Would you like me to come with?

                              ALAN
                    No...It might get a little
                    dangerous. I wouldn't want...
          He trails off. Chastity nods.

                              CHASTITY
                    I'm so sorry...about everything.

                              ALAN
                    Thanks for all your help.
          Awkward silence. The cold desert wind blows.

                              CHASTITY
                    There's no sense...in exchanging
                    numbers or anything...right?

                              ALAN
                    Yeah, probably not...
          Alan looks genuinely sad.

          

                                                                  89.

          

          

                              CHASTITY
                    Well...I'll always remember you as
                    a great first husband, then.
          They both smile weakly.

                              CHASTITY (CONT'D)
                    You can just send the divorce
                    papers to the Crazy Horse or
                    whatever...
          Alan nods, okay. Another awkward pause.

                              CHASTITY (CONT'D)
                    Thanks for reminding me that there
                    are still some really good guys out
                    there, Alan. I don't...I don't get
                    to meet too many of them.
          She smiles a bit sadly, kisses him on the cheek, and walks
          off. TIGHT ON Alan's Grandmother's ring still on her finger.
          Alan doesn't remember the ring, however; he's too busy
          watching her walk out of his life, and feeling a real sense
          of loss...
          Then Vick fires up the car next to him.

                              VICK
                    We gotta go, man.
          Alan nods, yeah, and gets in the car...

          INT. VICK'S CAR -- PRE-DAWN

          Vick's car races down a dark, abandoned desert highway. The
          guys look tired, stressed, and most of all, scared.

                              ALAN
                    Yep, just driving out to the middle
                    of desert to meet some mobsters,
                    what could possibly go wrong...?
          The guys all frown.

                              STU
                    So what's our plan?

                              ALAN
                    I think we should tell Mr. Lang
                    that we couldn't get the money, but
                    that, if he's amenable, we could
                    create a payment calendar--

          

                                                                     90.

          

          

                              VICK
                    We're gonna give Jimmy a dummy bag
                    of money, grab Doug, and make a run
                    for it.

                              ALAN
                    Yes, good! What an airtight plan--!

                               VICK
                    Jimmy Lang doesn't do payment
                    calendars, Alan! Trust me: this is
                    our only shot of getting Doug back!
                    Left turn!
          Vick skids onto Highway 12 -- a barely labelled dirt road.
          Things are quickly going from bad to worse...

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:

          THE FIRST RAYS OF DAWN
          streaking across Venice Beach.

          TITLE CARD: "SUNDAY, 6:04AM"

          INT. VENICE BUNGALOW -- MORNING

          Tracy exits her bedroom in her jammies, looking like she
          barely slept. Her father is up, and making breakfast.

                              TRACY
                    Any word from Doug?

                               MR. TURNER
                    Nope.

                        (BEAT)
                    I know you don't want to hear it,
                    Trace, but you deserve better.
          Tracy frowns, overwhelmed with stress.

                              TRACY
                    I'm sure everything's fine. They're
                    all smart, capable adults...

                                                              CUT TO:

          VICK DELICATELY LAYING CASH INSIDE HIS DUFFEL BAG
          on top of his dirty clothing, fruitlessly trying to create
          the appearance of a bag full of money. He's using some $20
          bills, but also some $5's and $1's.

          

                                                                     91.

          

          

                              VICK
                    This all the cash we got?
          The guys frown at their empty wallets, yeah. We are

          INT. VICK'S CAR/EXT. MOJAVE DESERT -- DAWN

          The Caddy is parked next to MILE MARKER 26 in the middle of
          the windy desert. The Las Vegas skyline is just barely
          visible in the distance.
          Vick very delicately zips up his duffel bag so as not to
          disturb the bills, and places it on his lap.

                              ALAN
                    This is the dumbest plan ever.

                              VICK
                    Alan I need you positive please.

                              STU
                    Here they come.
          They all look up to see a WHITE YUKON approaching on the far
          horizon, kicking up a trail of dust. The guys tense up.

                              VICK
                    Stuart?

                              STU
                    Yeah?

                              VICK
                    There's an emergency bottle of
                    tequila in my glove box. Get it out
                    please.
          Stu opens the glovebox, pulls out a bottle of Patron. He
          opens it, takes a swig, then passes it to Vick, who takes a
          pull and passes it to Alan, who also drinks.
          They all watch the white Yukon draw ever closer.

                              ALAN
                    I can't believe this is how we're
                    going to die...
          The Yukon pulls up about ten yards away. No one moves.
          The Yukon's doors open... The Cadillac's doors open...
          TIGHT ON the Jimmy Lang's RED BOOT as it hits the road...

          

                                                                     92.

          

          
          TIGHT ON Vick's LEATHER SHOE, then Alan's SAILING TOPSIDER,
          then Stu's FLIP-FLOP, as they all hit the dusty road...
          The two parties stand by their respective cars, facing off.
          Somewhere in the desert, a rattlesnake RATTLES.

                              JIMMY LANG
                    Let's see the money!
          Vick gently holds up his duffel bag.

                              VICK
                    Let's see Doug!
          Jimmy Lang nods to Kalolo, who opens the back door of the
          Yukon and pulls out a GUY with his hands tied behind his back
          and a plastic RALPH'S BAG over his head; he struggles a bit.
          The guys look a bit alarmed.

                              ALAN
                    Jesus, what'd they do to him?

                              VICK
                    Pull off the Ralph's bag!
          Jimmy yanks the bag off of the guy's head to reveal

          IT'S NOT DOUG
          It's some black dude. Vick, Stu, and Alan look confused.

                              VICK
                    Who the hell is that?!

                              JIMMY LANG

                        (ANNOYED)
                    This is Doug!
          He pushes the guy forward.

                              ALAN
                    Oh my God: it's the other Doug!
                    Roger's friend, the cake designer!

                              BLACK DOUG
                        (to Jimmy Lang)
                    I told you, man, I'm Doug Howland!
                    I barely even know these guys!

                              VICK
                    Yeah, you got the wrong Doug, man!

          

                                                                    93.

          

          
          Jimmy Lang and the thugs look exasperated.

                                 JIMMY LANG
                    You sure?!

                              VICK
                    Yeah, man, our Doug is white!

                              JIMMY LANG
                    But you were partying with this guy
                    at my birthday thing!

                              VICK
                    I don't know what to tell you, bro,
                    this isn't the Doug we requested!

                              JIMMY LANG
                    Well. I apologize for the mix-up...
                        (drawing his HUGE GUN)
                    But I'm still gonna need my money.
          Vick and the guys start backtracking towards their car.

                              ALAN
                    Oh my God Oh my God Oh my God...

                              JIMMY LANG
                    Don't move, Vick.
          Vick freezes, duffel in hand, as Stu and Alan slink from
          view. Jimmy reaches Vick, gun calmly trained at his head.

                              JIMMY LANG (CONT'D)
                    Now please. Give me my money.
          All eyes on Vick, anxiously clutching the bag in his hand...
          Sweat beads on his brow...

                              JIMMY LANG (CONT'D)
                    Don't be stupid, son. You--
          Then Vick throws a hard left hook, SLAMMING Jimmy square in
          his massive stomach! And

          NOTHING HAPPENS
          Jimmy is built like a tank. Vick freezes, oh shit. Then Jimmy
          PISTOL-WHIPS Vick -- his lip explodes with blood and he falls
          to the ground.

                              VICK
                    Christ that hurts!

          

                                                                     94.

          

          
          Then Jimmy picks up the duffel bag. Hefts it. Feels wrong. He
          goes to open the zipper when he hears:

                               STU

                     AAAAAAAHHHHHHH!
          Jimmy looks up to see Stu insanely charging him like the
          linebacker he once was! Jimmy raises his gun, but

          STU TACKLES JIMMY TO THE GROUND FIRST!
          The gun flies free and they wrestle for it! Dust flies!

          BACK BY THE YUKON
          The two Guamians fumble for their guns -- but it's difficult
          with huge CASTS on their shooting hands!

          ON BLACK DOUG
          He sees what's going down, and, his hands tied behind his
          back, takes off sprinting towards Vegas!

          BY THE CADDILAC
          Alan looks around, what should I do?! What should I do?! Then
          he spots the keys in the ignition of the car. He hops in and
          fires up the engine! Just then

          THE TWO GUAMIANS OPEN FIRE
          Bullets pound into the Cadillac! Alan ducks down, terrified,
          and floors the gas!

                               ALAN
                     I'm being shot at! I'm being shot
                     at!

          UP AHEAD
          Jimmy Lang throws Stu off of him and recovers his gun,
          panting. He cocks it, aims it at Stu on the ground.

                               JIMMY LANG
                     I really didn't want to kill anyone

                     TODAY--
          Then WHAM! Alan drives the car into Jimmy Lang at 25mph!
          The obese mobster is pitched off his feet, and lands a good
          ten yards away, in a heap of dust!
          The guys freeze, shocked.

          

                                                                  95.

          

          
          The Guamians freeze, shocked.

                              ALAN
                    Oh my god, is he okay?!

                              VICK
                    Who cares! Go go!
          Alan floors the car while Stu and Vick SPRINT and DIVE in!
          The caddy peels the hell out of there, kicking up rocks and
          dust! The Guamians FIRE after them!

          BULLETS IMPACT ALL ALL OVER CAR
          taking out the tail-lights, the windshield, the headrests.
          The guys duck down til they're sufficiently far away. Then
          they sit up, amazed, out of breath.

                              STU
                    I can't believe you just saved my
                    life!

                              VICK
                    I can't believe you just drove my
                    car into Jimmy Lang!
          Alan drives, his eyes as big as saucers.

                              STU
                    He's gonna be really upset!

                              ALAN
                    Yeah, I was just thinking that!

          BACK ON JIMMY LANG
          The huge mobster lies face-down on the desert floor. His two
          henchmen waddle up, highly concerned.

                              KIKIOLANI
                    Boss, Boss, you okay?!
          Jimmy sputters into the dirt, furious.

                              JIMMY LANG
                    Find Vick... And kill him.

          INT. VICK'S CAR -- DAWN

          The guys race down the dusty highway in traumatized silence.

                              ALAN
                    Now can we call Tracy?

          

                                                                  96.

          

          
          Vick frowns and blots his split lip with his sleeve.

                              VICK
                    Yeah. It's probably time.

                                                            CUT TO:

          EXT. MOJAVE DESERT -- LONE PAYPHONE -- DAWN

          The guys pull up at a lone, dusty payphone in the middle of
          the desert. They all look at the phone.

                              ALAN
                    Who wants to make the call?
          Beat. Then Vick reaches for his nose, odd man out. Stu and
          Alan immediately reach for their noses, too. It's close.

                              STU
                    That was you!

                              ALAN
                    What?! No! I beat you by a mile!

                              STU
                    Vick, who won?!

                               VICK

                        (FROWNING)
                    Actually...I should do it. This
                    weekend was mostly my fault. I need
                    to Man Up.
          Alan looks shocked -- and impressed -- by Vick's newfound
          sense of responsibility.

                              ALAN
                    Well, I'll be damned...
          Vick grabs the bottle of Patron, takes a long swig. Beat.

                              VICK
                    I still can't believe Stu banged my
                    sister.
          Vick hands the bottle to Alan, gets out, and makes for the
          pay phone...

                                                            CUT TO:

          INT. BEL AIR BAY CLUB -- BRIDAL SUITE -- DAY

          Tracy is putting on her makeup in the bridal suite. Her stern
          dad blows in.

          

                                                                     97.

          

          

                              MR. TURNER
                    Any word from Doug?
          The way he spits out "Doug" tells us all we need to know
          about how Mr. Turner feels about his future son-in-law.

                              TRACY
                    No, but I'm sure he's--
          Just then, Tracy's CELL PHONE rings. She quickly answers it.

                                TRACY (CONT'D)
                    Hello?

          INTERCUT WITH:

          VICK
          In the desert, on the pay phone, looking through his busted
          aviators into the rising sun.

                              VICK
                    Tracy, it's Vick.

                                TRACY
                    Hey Vick!

                    Listen, honey...The bachelor party
                    got a little out of control and,
                    well...we lost Doug.

                              TRACY
                        (her jaw dropping)
                    What?! But we're getting married in
                    like four hours!

                              VICK
                    Yeah, that's not gonna happen...

          BACK IN THE CAR
          Alan starts to take a pull of Patron -- when he freezes,
          realizing something!

          BACK TO VICK
          on the phone with Tracy, being genuinely contrite.

                              VICK
                    Look, I'm really sorry, Trace. This
                    is all my fault--

          

                                                                    98.

          

          
          Suddenly, Alan flies out of nowhere and snatches the receiver
          out of Vick's hand!

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    What the--?!
          Alan gets on the phone with Tracy, his heart racing.

                              ALAN
                    Tracy, it's Alan! Hey, Vick is just
                    joking around! We've got Doug right
                    here!
          Vick looks like: what?!

                              TRACY

                        (HORRIFIED)
                    What kind of joke is that?!

                              ALAN
                    I know, Vick is such a prick! We'll
                    see you at the wedding! Bye!
          Alan hangs up and races back to the car. Vick follows.

                              VICK
                    What are you doing?

                              ALAN
                    I know where Doug is!

          Tracy stands in her bridal suite. Then she just BREAKS DOWN
          SOBBING. Her father hurries over, concerned...

          Alan floors the car back onto the 15 towards Vegas, amped!

                              ALAN
                    Remember when we saw Doug's bed
                    impaled on the griffin thing?!

                              STU
                    Yeah, we threw it out the window.

                               ALAN
                    No: the windows don't open,
                    remember?!

          

                                                         99.

          

          

                               VICK
                    So how did--?

                        (REALIZING)
                    Oh my God.

                              STU
                    I don't get it.

                              ALAN
                    And that's why we've been seeing
                    Doug's clothes all over Vegas! He
                    was trying to signal someone!

                              VICK
                    I don't believe it...

                              STU
                    I-I still don't get it--

                              ALAN
                    And it totally jives with the
                    timeline, right?! We brought Doug
                    back to the hotel at 5:00, he was
                    passed out...

                              VICK
                    It's so obvious!

                              STU
                    Not...to me...so much?

                              VICK
                    How'd you figure it out?!

                    The Patron, man! It reminded me of
                    our first drink of the night!

                              VICK
                    Honestly, dude, you're a genius.

                              STU

                    CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WHERE

                    DOUG IS?!

                              VICK
                    He's on the roof!
          Stu looks confused, the roof?

          

                                                                    100.

          

          

                               ALAN
                     After Doug passed out, we must've
                     taken him up there in his bed as a
                     prank, so he'd wake up on the roof
                     or whatever? Then we forgot him.

                               VICK
                     And all day he's been throwing his
                     crap off the roof, trying to signal
                     someone to get him down!

                               STU

          The guys race through the lobby at top speed.

          EXT. MANDALAY BAY -- ROOFTOP -- DAY

          The guys burst out of the steel door, onto the massive black
          tar roof. It's empty.

                     DOUG?! DOUG?!

                     WHERE ARE YOU, MAN?!
          But Doug is nowhere to be seen. The guys start to despair...
          Then...stepping out from behind an air-conditioning vent,
          naked except for tighty-whities, his entire body bright pink
          from sunburn...

          IS DOUG!
          And he looks furious. The guys run to him, overjoyed!

                               ALAN

                     DOUG!

          Before they can hug him, though, Doug holds up his hand, and
          whispers, nasty, parched:

                              DOUG
                    Don't...even...talk to me.
          The guys stop short.

          and clutching an arm-full of BOTTLED WATERS, through the
          hotel lobby. Alan is arguing into his cellphone.
          As they pass ATASHIR at his desk, Vick yells over:

                              VICK
                    Why'd you do it, sweet Atashir?!
                    Why did you betray us?!

                              ATASHIR
                    Because they paid me. And also
                    because you're kind of racist.

                              VICK
                    Fair enough! See you next time, you

          They blow out of the hotel...

          Vick is at the wheel, leaning on the HORN, keeping the three-
          doored Caddy at 110 miles per hour. When traffic gets thick,
          he doesn't hesitate to drive in the shoulder.
          In the backseat, Doug chugs bottled water, still simmering.

          sliding door and, wind whipping his face, throws a huge
          PACKAGE over to Alan, who stands and catches it! Vick nods at

          IN THE AUDIENCE
          Everyone smiles, AHHS, and snaps photos...

          AT THE ALTAR
          The groomsmen smile as well. Vick whispers to Doug:

                              VICK
                    She looks beautiful, man.

          

                                                                 105.

          

          
          Doug still doesn't speak to him.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    That's cool. I get it.

          TRACY
          reaches the altar, then turns to her dad. His face is a mess
          of emotions. They hug.

                              TRACY
                    I love you, Daddy.

                              MR. TURNER
                    I love you too, pumpkin.
          Tracy's Dad shoots Doug a nasty look before taking his seat
          in the first row.
          Then Tracy approaches Doug at the altar, and whispers to him,
          angry, hurt:

                              TRACY
                    Where were you? And why are you
                    pink?

                              DOUG
                    It's a long story. All I can say is
                    I'm so sorry. And I promise, for as
                    long as we're married, I will never
                    ever put you through something like
                    this again.
                        (desperate, pleading)
                    Can... Can you forgive me?
          Tracy studies his face, searching...
          All the guests wait with bated breath...
          The groomsmen wince, come on come on come on...
          Then, unable to be mad at Doug, Tracy smiles and kisses him.
          He kisses her back. The guests all SIGH in relief. The
          groomsmen exhale, whew. Vick and Alan covertly knock fists.
          The Minister clears his throat.

                              MINISTER
                    We, um, we traditionally wait til
                    the end for the kiss...?
          But Doug and Tracy just keep on kissing...

                                                 MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

          

                                                                    106.

          

          

          DOUG AND TRACY STILL KISSING
          at the reception. The entire wedding party is applauding.

          CHAMPAGNE IS UNCORKED
          and the WEDDING BAND kicks in. We are now down on the lawn,
          where white tables and a dance floor have been set up.

          STANDING IN THE BACK OF THE RECEPTION
          Vick, Stu, and Alan aggressively APPLAUD and WHISTLE for the
          bride and the groom.

                              VICK
                    We did it, fellahs. We pulled it
                    off.

                              ALAN
                    I never had a doubt.
          They LAUGH. Alan smiles, more relaxed than we've ever seen
          him. They sip champagne and watch Doug and Tracy enjoy their
          first dance on the dance floor.

                              STU
                    You think Doug's ever going to talk
                    to us again?

                              VICK
                    Give him time.

                              ALAN
                    Yeah. Like a decade or two--
          Then Stu sees someone approaching over Alan's shoulder.

                              STU
                    Uh-oh.
          The guys all look over to see

          BECKY
          Alan's girlfriend of 14 years, bearing down on them, irate.

                              VICK
                    Hey Beck--!

                              BECKY
                    Shut up, Vick! Alan, where the hell
                    have you been?! I've been calling
                    and calling! What, you don't answer
                    your phone anymore?!

          

                                                                    107.

          

          
          Alan shrinks down, back to being the chastised boyfriend.

                               ALAN
                     I-I'm so sorry, I can explain--
          Then there's a WOMAN'S VOICE behind them.

                                 WOMAN'S VOICE
                     Alan?
          They all turn to see

          CHASTITY
          standing behind them in a very sexy, very elegant dress, her
          hair back. She cleans up nicely. Alan swallows, whoa.

                               VICK
                     This just got complicated...

                                 ALAN
                     Jennifer?
          Chastity smiles that he called her by her real name.

                               CHASTITY
                     I-I know I wasn't invited, but I
                     just had to return this...
          She hands Alan his GRANDMOTHER'S HOLOCAUST RING. Becky
          watches on, stunned.

                               BECKY
                     Okay: who the hell is this chick,
                     and why the hell does she have your
                     Grandmother's wedding ring?!
          Alan looks back and forth between Becky and Chastity...
          It's the moment of truth. The fork in life's road...

                               BECKY (CONT'D)
                     Talk, you moron! Jesus, you're just
                     like your mother! Talk! Who's the
                     ho wearing my ring?!
          And in that moment, it all becomes so clear. Alan turns:

                               ALAN
                     She's my wife.
          Becky's jaw drops. Chastity smiles slightly. Stu and Vick
          grin, oh shit!

          

                                                                 108.

          

          

                              ALAN (CONT'D)
                    We don't make each other happy
                    anymore, Beck. And we can keep not
                    making each other happy for another
                    14 years -- hell, maybe even
                    another 50 years -- but let's not.
                    Let's find people who make our
                    hearts race. Let's be excited and
                    fun and alive again...
          Alan looks at Becky, sincere, honest. Beat.

                              BECKY
                    Are you fucking kidding me?
          Alan shakes his head, sadly, no.

                              ALAN
                    I'm sorry, Beck. I really am.
                        (to Chastity)
                    Can I buy you a free drink?
          Chastity smiles, takes his arm, and they walk off together
          towards the bar.

                              CHASTITY
                    We're not...actually...still
                    married, are we?

                              ALAN
                    Let's start with dinner, and see
                    where it goes...?

                              CHASTITY
                        (smiling warmly)
                    I'd like that.

          BACK ON BECKY
          She finally recovers enough to speak:

                              BECKY
                    Alan! Alan Steven Mervish, get back
                    here this second!
                        (but Alan keeps walking)
                    Don't you walk away from me, you
                    stupid little clown! I own you! GET

                    BACK HERE IMMEDIATELY!
          But Alan just keeps walking away with Chastity. Vick and Stu
          wave him on, go dude! Go!
          Then Becky turns on them. Beat. They both scatter, terrified.

          

                                                                    109.

          

          

          STAY WITH STU
          as he hurries off through the crowd. After a moment, he

          HEARS:

                              VOICE
                    Daddy?!
          Stu turns to see his TWO ANGELIC DAUGHTERS in sundresses
          racing through the crowd towards him! They leap into his
          arms, so excited to see him! He scoops them both up.

                              STU
                    Oh, I missed you guys so much!

                              HAYLEE
                    We missed you too, daddy!

                              KAITLIN
                    You're the best dad ever!
          Beat.
          And then Stu just starts BAWLING. Tears everywhere.
          His lovely wife ERIN appears, harried, a diaper bag over her
          shoulder, and sees him crying. She rolls her eyes.

                              ERIN
                    Jesus, are you still drunk?
          Stu shakes his head, no, and keeps SOBBING as he pulls her
          into a big family hug...

          INT. BEL AIR BAY CLUB -- MEN'S BATHROOM -- LATER

          Vick, a cocktail in hand, his tie undone, heads into the
          men's room and approaches a urinal. Then KIKIOLANI and KALOLO
          FANALUA walk in behind him, still in their huge arm casts,
          still very pissed. Vick inhales, scared.

                              VICK
                    Okay, okay, I'll go with you.
                    Just...don't ruin the wedding.
          Then JIMMY LANG enters the bathroom on RED CRUTCHES.

                              JIMMY LANG
                    I really didn't want it to end like
                    this, Vick.
          Vick nods, resigned, and starts towards him. Then Jimmy
          extends his hand for Vick to shake.

          

                                                                   110.

          

          

                                 JIMMY LANG (CONT'D)
                    Good luck.

                              VICK
                        (totally thrown)
                    Um, what...?

                              JIMMY LANG
                    Your friend Alan just paid your
                    marker. Took out a second mortgage
                    on his house. The full 200 grand,
                    plus medical expenses, which I
                    thought was a classy touch.
          Vick looks blown away.

                              JIMMY LANG (CONT'D)
                    Without our friends, we are
                    nothing, Vick. Remember that.
          The three injured mobsters exit. Vick remains standing there,
          overwhelmed, his life literally saved...

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:

          VICK, STU, AND ALAN
          standing on the cliffs overlooking the Pacific, drinks in
          hand, as the wedding reception rages on behind them.

                              VICK
                    I will pay you back, you know.

                              ALAN
                    Damn straight you will!
          They all LAUGH.

                              VOICE BEHIND THEM
                    Okay, so what the hell happened
                    this weekend?
          The guys turn to see Doug approaching, smiling. They grin as
          he falls in with them, looking out at the calm blue ocean.

                              VICK
                    Well, Alan married a stripper, Stu
                    went gay, and I learned a very
                    important life lesson from an obese
                    hoodlum.

                              STU
                    We'll tell you the whole story when
                    you get back from your honeymoon.

          

                                                                   111.

          

          

                              ALAN
                    We really are sorry, man.
          Doug nods, I know. Vick raises his cocktail.

                              VICK
                    To Doug and Tracy.

                              STU
                    To Doug and Tracy.

                              ALAN
                    To Doug and Tracy.

                              DOUG
                    To me and Tracy -- and to being
                    here, with my three former best
                    friends in the world...
          The guys LAUGH.

                               DOUG (CONT'D)
                    There's nowhere else I'd rather be
                    right now.
          They nod, heartfelt, hear-hear.

                              DOUG (CONT'D)
                    That said, let's not get too stupid
                    tonight, okay? I'm going on my
                    honeymoon in 24 hours...
          The guys all nod reassuringly.

                              THE GUYS
                    No, no. / We'll be good. / Totally,
                    dude.
          The guys exchange a sly smile, CLINK glasses, then

                                                         CUT TO BLACK.


         THE END

          1 EXT. FOREST FLOOR - DAY. 1

          Winter. Silence on the forest floor. Snow falling. Then the
          sound of breathing. The soft footfall of a person running.
          HANNA, fourteen years old, long hair, eyes like blue ice,
          glides through the trees, a bow strapped to her shoulder. She
          is dressed in animal skins and fur shoes. She blends almost
          completely into the landscape of trees and snow.
          She stops dead. Her breath visible in the freezing air.
          Suddenly alert, she has spotted her prey. A REINDEER nuzzling
          the snow, trying to unearth a patch of grass to eat. Its head
          pops up - danger. Too late. The sudden swoosh and the snap of
          an arrow piercing its skin.
          The deer flops to the ground with a thud. It whines, its feet
          dig at the earth. Its mouth gnaws at the icy air. Steam
          pouring from its nostrils.
          HANNA approaches, removes a fur glove. She bends to her
          knees.
          She reaches out and gently pets the animals frightened face.
          She runs her hand down along its neck, in towards the wound.

                         HANNA
          I just missed your heart.
          She stands and pulls out an old pistol from her waist
          holster.
          She fires two shots directly at CAMERA.

          CUT TO TITLE: HANNA

          2 EXT. FOREST FLOOR - LATER. 2

          A knife enters the deer near its anus.

                         HANNA

                         (WHISPER)
          Remove the penis and scrotum, make
          a deep, circular cut around the
          rectum.
          HANNA pulls the knife up towards the brisket.

          HANNA (CONT'D)

                         (WHISPER)
          Cut from the rear to the brisket.
          She works calmly without expression.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.

          3 EXT. FOREST FLOOR - LATER 3

          The deer lies on it's side.
          HANNA breaths hard. She reaches deep into the body cavity
          and pulls out intestine, stomach, liver.
          She freezes, sensing danger.
          Her hand deep inside the animal. She listens. She looks out
          into the still forest. No sound.
          ERIK, mid forties, a mammoth with leathery face, stands
          behind her like a ghost.

                         ERIK
          You're dead. Right now. I've
          killed you.
          HANNA spins spraying deer-blood on to the snow and brings
          her fist right to ERIK's face. He blocks and thumps an open
          palm on to HANNA's shoulder sending her sprawling into the
          snow.
          She leaps to her feet, as ERIK aims a kick at her head. She
          dodges, punches below his knee cap, and goes for her
          pistol. ERIK slaps the hand away.

          ERIK (CONT'D)
          Use your hands!
          She goes for the gun again and again he stops her.
          He moves in tight, pulling the gun from its holster and
          tossing it deep into the forest.
          HANNA clips ERIK'S temple sending him to the ground.
          She wraps her arms around his neck preparing to snap...
          ... but she can't.
          He throws her over his shoulder into a pile of snow.
          ERIK stands and wipes the snow from his pants. His face shows
          a touch of frustration.
          He plods into the forest.

          ERIK (CONT'D)
          Drag it back yourself.
          HANNA drags herself to the deer's side. She stares at its
          dead face.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

          4 EXT. FOREST FLOOR - LATER 4

          HANNA clears the kill site. Wipes the last dots of blood on
          to a stick. No sign she was ever there.

          5 EXT. FOREST FLOOR - EVENING 5

          HANNA drags the 200 lb deer on a makeshift sled. She lifts
          her knees high and moves at a steady pace.
          Hidden among the trees, a little way off, ERIK is watching
          her.

          6 EXT. LOG CABIN. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST - EVENING 6

          A log cabin built around an ancient tree surrounded by the
          thick forest. HANNA is standing in the snow, stripping the
          deer with a knife. It's a tough job but she does it no fuss.

          7 INT. LOG CABIN - EVENING 7

          Almost everything ERIK and HANNA own they've made themselves
          using what can be found in the forest. What few possessions
          that have been brought in from the outside world are old and
          worn.
          HANNA is making a fire using a bow drill. The friction of the
          drill produces an ember which HANNA carefully transfers to
          some dried leaves.

          8 INT. LOG CABIN - LATER 8

          HANNA and ERIK sit either side of a small fire, still dressed
          in furs.
          HANNA swirls a spoon around in a dish of stew. ERIK takes a
          mouthful, watches HANNA not eating.

                         ERIK
          What's wrong? Are you hurt?
          She keeps swirling her spoon.

          ERIK (CONT'D)
          You were half asleep.

                         HANNA
          I'll do better next time.

                         ERIK
          German.

                         ERIK

          HANNA studies her food and slowly takes a spoonful.

          ERIK (CONT'D)

                         (INSISTENT)
          Spanish.

          (In Spanish w/ English

                         SUBTITLES)
          Did you really want me to snap your
          neck?
          He looks at her - drops the quiz.

                         ERIK
          How much did you pull off the deer?

                         HANNA
          A hundred and twenty with scraps.

                         ERIK
          About 200 pounds in total?
          HANNA nods.

          ERIK (CONT'D)
          That explains it.

                         HANNA
          What?

                         ERIK
          How you beat me. You're getting
          strong.
          HANNA almost blushes.
          ERIK stands to put his bowl away.

          ERIK (CONT'D)
          (In Spanish w/ English

                         SUBTITLES)

          5.

          ERIK (CONT'D)
          I'm glad you didn't snap my neck.

          9 INT. HANNA'S ROOM. LOG CABIN - NIGHT 9

          HANNA is in bed under fur covers listening while ERIK reads
          to her from an old encyclopedia.

                         ERIK
          The Great Blue Whale is the largest
          animal to have ever existed. A blue
          whale's tongue weighs over two and
          a half tons and its mouth is large
          enough to hold 90 tons of food and
          water.

                         HANNA
          How much is that?

                         ERIK
          It's bigger than the cabin. Its
          heart weighs thirteen
          hundred pounds and a male has seven
          gallons of testicles.
          HANNA smirks.

          ERIK (CONT'D)
          The Blue Whale's "music" can be
          heard for over 500 miles.
          He shuts the book.

          ERIK (CONT'D)
          Time for sleep.

                         HANNA
          Good night.
          He stands by her bed looking down at her.

                         ERIK
          Did you forget something?

                         HANNA
          No.
          ERIK takes HANNA'S gun out of his pocket and puts it on the
          table next to her bed.

          HANNA (CONT'D)
          Sorry.

                         ERIK
          Good night.
          He walks to the door. HANNA stops him with a question.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.

                         HANNA
          What's music like?

                         ERIK
          It's difficult to explain.

                         HANNA
          Try.
          He opens the encyclopedia again, leafs through the pages and
          reads.

                         ERIK

                         (READING)
          âMusic. A combination of sounds
          with a view to beauty of form and
          expression of emotion'.

                         HANNA
          But how does it feel?
          Erik is not equipped to answer such esoteric questions.

                         ERIK
          Good. It feels good. It's, uh,
          nice.

                         HANNA
          Tell me properly. Can you play
          music?

                         ERIK
          Your mother could. She used to sing
          very well.

                         HANNA
          I'd like to hear it for myself.

                         ERIK
          You will soon enough.

                         HANNA
          How soon?
          Erik looks away from her questioning eyes.

                         ERIK
          When you're ready.

                         HANNA
          I'm ready. I'm ready already.
          They look at each other- he weighs it up.

                         ERIK
          Just go to sleep now. I'll see you
          in the morning.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.
          Hanna covers herself in an animal skin as ERIK pulls a wattle
          screen across her bed, strokes her hair gently for a moment
          and leaves the room.
          HANNA reaches under her bed and takes out an old battered
          photograph, taken 15 years ago, of a YOUNG WOMAN with eyes
          like hers - her MOTHER, JOANNA ZADEK.

          10 EXT. LOG CABIN - MORNING 10

          The morning sunlight slants through the forest.
          ERIK is walking through the trees. He stops, raises his
          pistol at a tree trunk some distance away and fires.
          The tree breaks apart.

          11 INT. HANNA'S ROOM. LOG CABIN - MORNING 11

          HANNA wakes with the sound of the GUNSHOT. She is still
          holding her mothers photgraph.
          HANNA pushes the photograph under her mattress and climbs out
          of bed.

          12 EXT. LOG CABIN. SHOOTING RANGE - MORNING 12

          Another GUNSHOT breaks a tree apart.
          Hanna fires. Another tree breaks apart. She rolls and
          fires.
          She rolls and fires. She reloads. And fires.
          ERIK watching.

          13 EXT. LOG CABIN - DAY 13

          HANNA attacks ERIK. Hand. Knee. Elbow. Fist. He defends
          easily.

                         ERIK
          Again.
          They reset. She repeats the motion. Hand. Knee. Elbow. Fist.

          ERIK (CONT'D)
          Again.
          Hand. Knee. Elbow. Fist. She's getting faster. Her strikes
          are solid.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.

          14 EXT. LOG CABIN - DAY 14

          A medium size log nailed along two pillars of the cabin
          acts as a chin-up bar.
          Erik and Hanna do chin-ups. Both are fit. Neither will give
          up. ERIK observing HANNA's power. Both have the sense that
          he is judging her. HANNA's face fiercely determined.

          15 EXT. LOG CABIN - DAY 15

          ERIK and HANNA sit with their backs to a tree in the huge
          forest as they breathlessly recover from the exhaustion of
          the exercise. HANNA speaks fast, reciting.

                         HANNA
          I live in Leipzig. German city.
          Population 0.7 Million people. We
          live at Number 7 Weissingerplatz. I
          go to school at the Klaus Kohle
          Gymnasium and my best friends are
          Rudi Gunter and Clara Schliess. I
          like literature and sport, in
          particular tennis and athletics. I
          have a dog called Trudi.

          16 EXT. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST - DAY 16

          HANNA is running, racing ERIK. Fierce determination, almost
          anger in her eyes. They reach the river and dive in.

          17 EXT. RIVER - DAY. 17

          HANNA and ERIK are swimming hard against the current of the
          fast-flowing river, working at full pelt just to stay still.
          They swim and swim, their muscles busting, their lungs
          bursting.

                         ERIK
          Don't give up! Don't give up!
          HANNA's arms flails as she fights against the stream and she
          screams in pain. She is grabbed under by the undertow and is
          pulled downwards. For a second she is underwater and in
          darkness but ERIK's hand pulls her back up and she breaks the
          surface with a gasp of relief.

          18 EXT. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST. RIVER BANK. 18

          On the bank, HANNA climbs out. ERIK approaches her but
          moodily, even angrily, she pushes him away.

                         HANNA
          I didn't need your help.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.
          Her face sullen, she walks away into the forest. He stares
          after her.

          19 EXT. CABIN - NIGHT 19

          Outside, ERIK stands alone, thinking. An OWL swoops down to
          catch a mouse then flies back up into the tree tops.

          20 INT. CABIN. HANNA'S ROOM - NIGHT. 20

          HANNA is asleep.
          ERIK enters the room.
          ERIK approaches the bed, and solemnly takes out a pistol and
          aims it at HANNA. He is tense with expectation.
          Suddenly HANNA bursts from her covers, smashes the pistol
          from ERIK's hand and smashes him down on to the bed. She
          grabs the pistol and points it at his face. She is alert,
          eyes intense, face proud. She speaks quietly.

                         HANNA
          I'm ready now.

                         ERIK
          Maybe.
          ERIK relaxes. It's a false beat.
          He lunges again at her, really violently. He seems to be
          really trying to hurt her.
          But HANNA has reached under her mattress and there is a flint
          knife - in an instant it is at ERIK's neck. She pricks his
          neck slightly. It bleeds just slightly. Stillness and
          silence. HANNA breathless, angry.

          ERIK (CONT'D)
          You didn't tell me you had a knife.

                         HANNA
          You told me to think for myself.
          Isn't that what you want?
          She is angry for the first time. ERIK does not answer. Just
          stares at her.

          HANNA (CONT'D)
          I want to see things. I can't stay
          here forever.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

          21 EXT. LOG CABIN - NIGHT 21

          ERIK takes long lunging strides straight out from the cabin.
          He counts his paces.

                         ERIK
          One, two, three, four...

          22 EXT. FOREST FLOOR - DAY 22

          ERIK and HANNA are racing through the forest.
          Over this we continue to hear ERIK counting his paces from
          the previous scene.

          ERIK (V.O.)
          ...five, six, seven, eight...

          23 EXT. LOG CABIN - NIGHT 23


                         ERIK
          ...nine, ten.
          After 10 paces, ERIK makes a 90 degree turn and enters the
          tree line. The snow and mud crunch under his boots.
          We continue to inter-cut the following with more close-ups of
          HANNA training: climbing, fighting, chin-ups, shooting. All
          the while we continue to hear ERIK counting out his paces.
          After 40 paces, with the cabin light distant, ERIK falls to
          his knees. He unsheathes a large knife and jams it into the
          frozen earth.

          24 EXT. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST - MORNING 24

          HANNA comes out of the cabin, rubbing her eyes and yawning,
          eating a hunk of cold meat.
          She looks up to see a snow fox staring at her from the tree
          line. She crouches and holds out what's left of her
          breakfast.
          The fox approaches gingerly, delicately.

                         HANNA
          Hello little foxy... foxy loxy...
          come on... come and share my
          breakfast.
          The fox comes to her and nervously accepts the scrap,
          withdrawing a few feet to eat it. HANNA shuffles forward
          carefully and gently pats the snow fox - it is only a cub.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.
          As the fox eats it makes low grunting noises which HANNA
          expertly mimics - causing the fox to look up, puzzled - they
          seem to have a genuine connection - as if they've done this
          before.
          Suddenly the snow fox freezes, pricks up its ears, looks up,
          HANNA looks up too.
          An aeroplane is approaching overhead. The fox darts back into
          the undergrowth as the roar of the plane reverberates through
          the forest.
          HANNA jumps to her feet and with incredible speed and
          dexterity climbs to the very top of a near by tree. The plane
          roars over her head and disappears over the snowy wilderness,
          oblivious to HANNA'S tiny presence.
          It's only now that we see the full extent of HANNA'S
          isolation.

          25 INT. CABIN - MORNING. 25

          HANNA enters breathless with excitement. ERIK sits pensively
          with his back to the door.

                         HANNA
          Did you see it? Wasn't it
          beautiful, like thunder. I had to
          stick my fingers in my ears it was
          so loud. Did you hear it?
          She stops, sensing ERIK'S mood.

          HANNA (CONT'D)
          What's wrong?
          Sitting in front of ERIK is a metal case, caked with frozen
          dirt. ERIK pops open the case. Inside a tangle of technology.
          HANNA looks at the case, mesmerized.

          HANNA (CONT'D)
          What does it do?

                         ERIK
          It tells Marissa Wiegler where we
          are.
          He looks at her, a hint of a challenge.

          ERIK (CONT'D)
          When you want to leave here all you
          have to do is flip that switch.
          She approaches the box and places a single finger on the
          small red switch.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.

          ERIK (CONT'D)
          But once it's done, there'll be no
          going back. She'll never give up
          until you're dead, or she is. You
          understand? I wont be there to hold
          your hand. So be sure. Be sure it's
          what you really want.

                         HANNA
          You're not scaring me.
          He looks at her disbelievingly.
          She shakes her head in protest, but simultaneously moves away
          from the switch.
          He softens towards her.

                         ERIK
          It's here. There's no rush. Take
          your time.
          HANNA turns her back on the box, but can't help taking
          another look at it over her shoulder.

          26 INT. CABIN. HANNA'S ROOM - NIGHT 26

          HANNA is under the covers again while ERIK reads more from
          the encyclopedia.

                         ERIK
          Laika, a mongrel dog from the
          streets of Moscow, was the first
          animal to orbit the Earth. She was
          launched into outer space on the
          third of November, 1957.
          Scientists believed humans would be
          unable to survive conditions of
          outer space, so flights by animals
          were viewed as an experimental
          precursor to human missions. Her
          rocket was not designed to be
          retrievable, and Laika had always
          been intended to die.

                         HANNA
          That's sad.
          ERIK awkwardly turns the page to change subject.

                         ERIK
          When a star collapses the supernova
          explosion is 10 billion times
          brighter than other stars.
          HANNA shuts her eyes and tries to imagine how bright that
          might be.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

          27 INT. LOG CABIN - MORNING 27

          ERIK straps the bow to his chest and grabs a quiver of bolts.

                         ERIK
          Will you hunt with me?
          Hanna is sweeping the ground.

                         HANNA
          If you want.

                         ERIK
          It's up to you.

                         HANNA
          Me?

                         ERIK
          Yes.
          HANNA eyes the box sitting open, it's waiting for her.

                         HANNA
          I'll stay.

                         ERIK
          Fine.
          ERIK leaves abruptly.
          HANNA continues to sweep the ground, her movements bring her
          closer to the metal box. She stops sweeping and looks at the
          box. She turns and walks out of the cabin.

          28 EXT. LOG CABIN - CONTINUOUS 28

          HANNA comes out of the cabin and sits down on a tree trunk.
          She sees the snow fox cub but says nothing. It comes over and
          noses around the cabin, but HANNA'S mind is elsewhere.

                         HANNA
          (whispering to herself)
          Marissa Wiegler.

          29 INT. LOG CABIN - CONTINUOUS 29

          CLOSE ON - the metal box, the switch catches the light from
          the door as HANNA enters to confront it. The room is still
          and quiet.
          HANNA approaches the metal box and slowly reaches out her
          hand.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.

                         HANNA

                         (WHISPER)
          Come and find me.
          CLOSE ON - She flips the switch, a little red light begins to
          flash.
          An ALARM CLOCK begins to ring as we cut to -

          30 INT. MARISSA'S APARTMENT. VIRGINIA. USA - EARLY MORNING 30

          CLOSE ON - a bedside alarm clock ringing loudly.
          MARISSA WIEGLER, a handsome woman in her mid-40's with red
          hair, reaches over and slams the alarm clock off.
          She's alone in her bed. She always is. She has no children.
          She's made choices in her life and lives without looking
          back.
          She walks into her ensuite bathroom and looks at herself in
          the mirror. She collects her toothbrush and bares her teeth
          in a snarl as she brushes them. Her gums bleed a little.

          31 INT. LOG CABIN - EVENING 31

          HANNA tends to boiling pots. She's cooking a feast. ERIK
          enters. He stamps his feet shedding ice at the door.
          He walks by the box and sees the little red light flickering
          on. HANNA sees this and sees him smile, but she knows he's
          sad.

                         ERIK
          You were lucky to grab that deer.
          There was nothing out there today.
          ERIK looks over at the meal HANNA is preparing.

          ERIK (CONT'D)
          Smells good.
          He wraps an arm around her shoulder. They don't hug much and
          it shows. HANNA is almost defensive and tense. And then the
          hug is over.

          32 EXT. CIA HQ LANGLEY VIRGINIA - DAY 32

          MARISSA, wearing a sharp business suit, drives a black Acura
          into her designated spot in the CIA HQ's car park.
          As she gets out, we see the parking space is designated for

          MARISSA WIEGLER.
          Her young male PA and TECH ONE are already waiting for her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

                         TECH ONE
          Ma'am. We've had a signal reported
          by Interpol. We think it's Eric
          Heller.
          An unusual expression of shock on MARISSA'S face.

                         MARISSA
          Well I'll be.

                         TECH ONE
          It seems he's in Sweden. Jokkmokk.
          40 miles out.

                         MARISSA
          What the fuck is he doing there?

                         TECH ONE
          Living in the middle of nowhere,
          like the frigging Una Bomber.

                         MARISSA
          The son of a bitch. Sweden?
          Sweden?!
          The PA hands her a coffee and she hands him some files.

                         TECH ONE
          Apparently he turned on his
          locator.

                         MARISSA
          He's not an idiot.

                         TECH ONE
          I know... I mean I believe so. But
          that's what happened.

                         MARISSA
          After 14 years in Jokkmokk, maybe
          he'd rather go to prison.

          33 INT. LOG CABIN - NIGHT 33

          ERIK is leaning over a pail of water, cutting his beard off
          with a knife.

          MARISSA (V.O.)
          Eric Heller. From the Czech
          Republic. I recruited him in 1991
          when they were all joining the
          Velvet Revolution and sticking it
          to the commies
          ERIK, now clean shaven, opens a wooden case in the corner of
          the room and takes out an old folded three piece suit and
          rolled shirt.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

          MARISSA (V.O.)
          He couldn't wait to kiss some
          yankee butt and make some bucks
          doing our dirty work.
          ERIK awkwardly begins to change into the suit.

          34 INT. VIDEO CONFERENCE ROOM, LANGLEY. 34

          MARISSA sits in a video conference room surrounded by worried
          looking faces, with her are her close advisors WALT and BOB.
          She's also speaking into a microphone on the table in front
          of her.

                         MARISSA
          Trouble was he had his own way of
          doing things. Kinda paranoid.
          WALT fires up a computer screen and logs on. He uses an
          access code. This takes him to a new file. He enters the
          tracking device number. A name comes up. ERIK HELLER.
          He clicks on a link. HELLER's face pops on to the screen.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          Not a team player. Not a âjoiner.â
          He became increasingly isolated and
          disturbed. Kept mouthing off about
          classified programmes.
          WALT clicks on a link to a newspaper article which comes on
          to the screen: The headline: POLICE HUNT FOR MURDER SUSPECT.
          A picture of Heller in the article and a smashed car on a
          rural road. The two men stare at his face.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          I kept warning and he kept getting
          worse. In the summer of 1995 he
          took his girlfriend, Johanna Zadek,
          on a trip to the Baltic coast and
          blew her head off.
          WALT hits a new link: A still of the same young woman as the
          photo HANNA was previously looking at in her bedroom. Her
          name printed below it: JOHANNA ZADEK.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          Never heard from him again.

                         BOB
          Anybody know why?

                         MARISSA

                         (DRYLY)
          Maybe the pressure got to him, Bob.
          You know what that's like.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.
          A MALE VOICE comes from the speaker, this is LEWIS but we
          don't see him yet.

          LEWIS (O.S.)
          What do you want us to do?

                         MARISSA
          Bring him in.

                         WALT
          What do you mean? Call the police,

                         MARISSA -

                         MARISSA
          - Walt. This is exactly the kind of
          shit we can't have out there
          anymore. He was one of ours, we
          trained him. He kills some other
          poor woman and it's a cluster fuck.

                         WALT
          Tell it to Interpol. Let them pick
          him up. Try him for murder.

                         BOB
          He's right. This has nothing to do
          with us. I don't understand.

                         MARISSA
          You don't have to. I'm making the
          call.
          BOB and WALT exchange a look.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          Thank you, Gentlemen. That'll be
          all.
          The video screen flickers off, people take their files and
          start to leave. MARISSA WIEGLER stands in the darkness.

          35 INT. HANNA'S ROOM. LOG CABIN - CONTINUOUS 35

          HANNA sits in her bed reading her encyclopaedia.
          ERIK, dressed incongruously in the suit and tie, enters and
          sits on the edge of her bed. She doesn't look up from her
          book. His face shows more emotion than we've seen before.

                         ERIK
          Hanna...
          HANNA looks up, still trying to hide her fear.

          ERIK (CONT'D)
          Tell me again?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.

                         HANNA
          Marissa Weigler.

                         ERIK
          Then?

                         HANNA
          Postcard.

                         ERIK
          Then?

                         HANNA
          What?

                         ERIK
          The address where we meet.

                         HANNA
          Wilhelm Grimm's house.
          Stephanstrasse 260. 10559, Berlin.
          Germany.
          ERIK moves a strand of hair from HANNA'S forehead and looks
          at her with paternal care.

                         ERIK
          Good night my sweet girl.
          He stands and quietly goes to the door when her voice stops
          him.

                         HANNA
          Father...
          He turns to look at her, both their eyes full of trepidation.

                         ERIK
          You can do this. You're ready. Just
          remember what I've taught you.
          She smiles reassuringly at him.

                         HANNA
          I'll see you there.

          36 EXT. LOG CABIN. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST - NIGHT. 36

          ERIK comes out of the cabin carrying a small rucksack. He
          closes the door behind him and takes a deep breath.

          37 INT/EXT. HANNA'S ROOM. LOG CABIN - CONTINUOUS 37

          HANNA gets out of bed and goes to the small window.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.
          She watches as ERIK walks away from the cabin for the last
          time.

          38 EXT. EDGE OF NORTH SWEDISH FOREST. NIGHT. 38

          Dusk in the forest as the flickering sun goes down. As
          peaceful a place as you could imagine. A calm blueness of
          impending night on the snow.
          Then a series of ropes break the top frame and FIFTY US
          SPECIAL FORCES dressed in white snow gear silently abseil
          down to the ground.

          39 INT. HANNA'S ROOM. LOG CABIN - NIGHT 39

          HANNA is doing push-ups on her bedroom floor.

          40 EXT. FOREST/CABIN - NIGHT 40

          Infra-red POV as the SPECIAL OPS TEAM head through the forest
          wearing night vision-goggles. The Leader of the Operation
          follows the tracker signal.

                         SPECIAL OPS
          Is this guy one of ours?

          HEAD OF OPS
          Used to be. Tread carefully, he's
          been in there a long time, he's
          damaged goods, and he knows we're
          coming.
          We see through the infra-red vision the endless trees in the
          pitch blackness.
          The SPECIAL OPS FORCES get closer. They see the cabin in the
          night. They approach. Silence in the darkness. Just the
          breathing of men in the icy cold.

          41 INT. HANNA'S ROOM. LOG CABIN - NIGHT 41

          HANNA stops her push-ups, sensing the SPECIAL FORCES
          approach.
          She silently springs to her feet and moves to the front of
          the cabin.
          She looks out and sees shadows moving among the trees.
          She turns and presses herself against the wall.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.

          42 EXT. LOG CABIN. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST - NIGHT 42

          The HEAD OF OPS waves TWO SPECIAL OPERATIVES forward. The
          rest of the forces surround the cabin, but at a distance.
          The two men approach the cabin. One opens the door and the
          other steps in. Then the first follows close behind. Both are
          engulfed by darkness.
          The rest of the forces wait in silence for a radio signal.
          The HEAD of SPECIAL OPS looses patience and picks up the
          radio.

          HEAD OF OPS
          McCullum? Do you read me?
          No response.

          HEAD OF OPS (CONT'D)
          I repeat, do you read me?
          The HEAD of OPS waves all thirty of his men closer to the
          cabin. Guns at the ready.
          The HEAD of OPS and five other men storm the cabin.

          43 INT. CABIN DINING AREA. 43

          Through night vision we see the cabin interior. Then the two
          SPECIAL FORCES, dead on the floor. Necks broken.
          Then find HANNA sitting quietly, looking timid and unsure.
          Just a little girl, her eyes shining in the dark.

          44 INT. LANGLEY. VIRGINIA. 44

          MARISSA is walking through long concrete corridor as her
          phone rings. She answers quickly.

                         MARISSA
          What is it?

          LEWIS (O.S.)
          Ma'am, this is Lewis.
          MARISSA affects a âbusiness as usualâ tone.

                         MARISSA
          Go ahead.

          LEWIS (V.O.)
          The target escaped.

                         MARISSA
          How did that happen?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.

          LEWIS (V.O.)
          We're thinking maybe he got away in
          the snow, in the thick snow, or...
          But he's in the wind and I have two
          men down.

                         MARISSA

                         (URGENT)
          Find him, Lewis. Find him and take
          him out.

                         LEWIS
          Ma'am. There's more. They found a
          child, his daughter.
          MARISSA turns pale.

          45 INT. CAMP G. HOLDING CELL. 45


          ON CLOSED CIRCUIT TELEVISION:
          A cement box. HANNA lies on a small bed. Not moving. Two
          American voices.

                         VOICE 1
          She hasn't moved since we brought
          her in.

                         VOICE 2 (BURTON)
          Has anyone talked to her?

                         VOICE 1
          They want a psych evaluation before
          they interrogate.

          46 INT. HANNA'S HOLDING CELL. 46

          HANNA lies on the cot. She's been cleaned up and is wearing
          an army regulation jump suit. The metal door drags open. A
          Doctor, BURTON, closes the door behind him. He walks up to

          HANNA.

                         BURTON
          Hello Hanna.
          Hanna lies motionless.

                         BURTON (CONT'D)
          My name is Dr. Burton. Would you
          like to talk to me?
          BURTON'S voice has been trained to engender a state of peace
          and security. HANNA sits up and hangs her legs off the side
          of the cot.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

                         HANNA
          I was told by my father to gain the
          upper hand.

                         BURTON
          Really. Interesting. What else did
          your father tell you?

                         HANNA
          Where am I?

                         BURTON
          You're in holding.

                         HANNA
          I see.

                         BURTON
          This must all be very strange for
          you. You've been in the forest a
          long time. But I want you to know
          no one's going to hurt you. We just
          want to talk to you about your
          father.
          HANNA seems to be staring up at the ceiling.

          BURTON (CONT'D)
          Hanna?
          He follows her eye-line to the CCTV camera above them.

                         HANNA
          Is that a camera?

                         BURTON
          Ah, yes, that's a camera. To keep a
          record.

                         HANNA
          Camera obscura, it's Latin for
          "dark chamber".

          47 INT. CAMP G. OBSERVATION ROOM. 47

          LEWIS sits with the MONITOR, watching HANNA watching him.

                         LEWIS
          Plug the CCTV through to Langley.
          Extension 247.
          MONITOR presses some buttons as LEWIS calls on his phone and
          speaks into it.

          LEWIS (CONT'D)
          You should have visual on the psych
          evaluation now.

          48 INT. OBS ROOM. LANGLEY HQ. NIGHT. CONT. 48

          MARISSA, alone in a Langley OBS ROOM. No one else there. Late
          at night in America. Something secret about Marissa here.
          On the screen she sees HANNA in the Interrogation Room. Her
          screen tells she is watching CAMP G - Interrogation Room 3.
          MARISSA watches HANNA intently.

                         HANNA
          It was first described by the
          Arabic scientist Ibn Alhazen in the
          year 1021.

                         MARISSA
          What's she saying?

          LEWIS (O.S.)
          Gobbledygook.

          49 INT. OBS ROOM. LANGLEY HQ. NIGHT. CONT. 49

          MARISSA stares at her screen, at the blank face of the
          fourteen year old HANNA. Focus in on MARISSA's face as she
          studies this strange young woman. The sense that MARISSA
          knows more about this girl than she is letting on.
          On the screen BURTON continues to probe.

                         BURTON
          Can I get you something? What do
          you like? Music? Magazines? Just
          say. Anything at all.

          50 INT. HANNA'S HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS 50

          HANNA leans forward. Looks at BURTON, who encourages her with
          his eyes. She whispers.

                         HANNA
          I want to speak to Marissa Wiegler.

          51 INT. OBS ROOM. LANGLEY - CONTINUOUS 51

          MARISSA sits in stunned silence.

          LEWIS (O.S.)
          Did you hear that?
          MARISSA pauses before she answers.

                         MARISSA
          Tell her I'll be there tonight.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.

                         LEWIS
          But...

                         MARISSA
          Just do it.

          52 INT. CAMP G. MILITARY LABORATORY. 52

          A white space with specialist lighting and the hum of
          specialised air pressurizes. A protected environment - this
          is the DNA lab. A MILITARY DOCTOR is looking at the result of
          something on a computer. It has shocked and intrigued him. He
          calls across to another doctor.

                         MILITARY DOCTOR 1
          John come and take a look at this
          kid's blood sample.
          MILITARY DOCTOR 2 walks across. He sees the sample on the
          screen.

          MILITARY DOCTOR 2.
          Is that right? That can't be right.

                         MILITARY DOCTOR 1
          And I got a sample of her hair.
          MILITARY DOCTOR 2 looks at the results, baffled.

                         MILITARY DOCTOR 2
          That must be contamination.

                         MILITARY DOCTOR 1
          What contamination? What would it
          be?

                         MILITARY DOCTOR 2
          Run it again.

          53 INT. HANNA'S HOLDING CELL. 53

          HANNA is sitting on her cot with her back against the wall.
          A metal door drags open.
          A pair of smart female shoes enter the room, accompanied by
          the military boots of two guards.

          FALSE MARISSA (O.C.)
          My name is Marissa Wiegler. You
          wanted to speak to me?
          HANNA turns to look.
          It is a completely different woman, dressed in similar
          clothes to MARISSA but not her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.
          HANNA stares at her, then looks at the two guards.

          FALSE MARISSA (CONT'D)
          (to the guards)
          You can wait outside.
          The guards exit and the door slams shut behind them.

          54 INT. CAMP G. OBSERVATION ROOM. DAY. CONT. 54

          In the Observation Room LEWIS is looking at a small Monitor.
          He speaks into a consoles microphone.

                         LEWIS
          You should have visual.

          55 INT. CIA LANGLEY OPERATIONAL HQ. EARLY DAWN. CONT. 55

          MARISSA WIEGLER sits alone in the empty CIA Langley
          headquarters, watching the CCTV relay.

          HANNA (V.O.)
          Where am I?

          56 INT. HANNA'S HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS 56

          HANNA stares at FALSE MARISSA awaiting an answer.

                         FALSE MARISSA
          You're in a safe place. Let's talk
          about your father. You must love
          him very much.

                         HANNA
          Where did you meet him?
          The false MARISSA pauses.

          57 INT. OPERATIONAL HQ. LANGLEY - CONTINUOUS 57

          MARISSA hears the question. Thinks fast, her mind totally
          focussed.

                         MARISSA
          Tell her it was by a news kiosk in
          Alexanderplatz, East Berlin. Say it
          was raining.

          58 INT. HANNA'S HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS 58

          FALSE MARISSA pauses looking at HANNA. We see that she has a
          tiny microphone in her ear.

                         FALSE MARISSA
          At a news kiosk. Alexanderplatz. In
          the rain.
          She smiles reassuringly. HANNA nods, looking at FALSE

          MARISSA.

          59 INT. CAMP G. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS 59

          LEWIS watches on the screen. But then gets a call from the
          Military Laboratory.

                         LEWIS
          Lewis.

                         MILITARY DOCTOR
          Sir we need to talk to you. We've
          run tests on the girl.
          His voice sounds urgent, concerned. But Marissa has
          interrupted.

          MARISSA (V.O.)
          What tests?
          As the argument continues, we see and hear on the screen the
          FALSE MARISSA continuing to talk to HANNA.

                         FALSE MARISSA
          Do you know where your father is?
          In the OBS room LEWIS, half watching the screen, explains to
          MARISSA on intercom.

                         LEWIS
          Standard DNA and meds.

          60 INT. OPERATIONAL HQ. LANGLEY - CONTINUOUS 60

          MARISSA, alone in Langley, suddenly alert.

                         MARISSA
          Send the results straight to me.
          On the screen FALSE MARISSA is talking to HANNA.

                         FALSE MARISSA
          Did he tell you where he was going?
          We're all worried about him.
          On the CCTV Hanna looks at the FALSE MARISSA. She begins to
          cry, holds out her arms to be held.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.

          61 INT. CAMP G. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS 61

          The MONITOR sees her cry and turns to LEWIS who is still half-
          embroiled in the tests discussion.

                         MONITOR
          Sir look.
          LEWIS looks at HANNA.

          62 INT. HANNA'S HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS 62

          The FALSE MARISSA tentatively takes HANNA in her arms.

                         FALSE MARISSA
          It's OK. It's OK.
          HANNA coils her thin arms around the FALSE MARISSA'S neck,
          clinging to her like a monkey.
          The FALSE MARISSA looks up to the security camera, slightly
          concerned. Hanna wriggles in her arms, to get a better
          grip...

          63 INT. OPERATIONAL HQ. LANGLEY - CONTINUOUS 63

          MARISSA watches this strange image of her false self hugging
          this young girl. HANNA begins to weep more and more,
          burrowing her face into the FALSE MARISSA.
          On the CCTV we hear.

          BURTON (V.O.)
          You want me to give her something?

          64 INT. HANNA'S HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS 64

          HANNA clutching on to FALSE MARISSA, nestles close, weeping.

                         FALSE MARISSA
          I think it might be necessary.

          65 INT. OPERATIONAL HQ. LANGLEY. CONT. 65

          MARISSA watches, now concerned. Something is wrong.

                         MARISSA
          Get her out of there.

          66 INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE HANNA'S HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS 66

          Burton comes rushing down the corridor filling a syringe as
          he goes. He arrives at HANNA'S door.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.

                         BURTON
          Open up.
          The first guard opens HANNA'S door.

          LEWIS (V.O.)
          Abort. I repeat. Abort.

          67 INT. HANNA'S HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS 67

          Hanna hugs, weeping, on to the FALSE MARISSA. BURTON hears
          the instruction to abort but too late...
          ...as suddenly and with total efficiency HANNA SNAPS the
          FALSE MARISSA's neck.

          68 INT. OPERATIONAL HQ. LANGLEY. DAY. CONT. 68

          MARISSA stares in shock as her false self slumps dead to the
          floor. Then she watches as HANNA grabs the first GUARDS
          handgun from his holster and fires two rounds into Burton's
          skull. And two more into the first GUARD's chest.

          69 INT. CAMP G. OBSERVATION ROOM. CONT. 69

          LEWIS immediately presses the Alarm Bell.

                         LEWIS
          Jee-sus wept!
          On another screen LEWIS watches as the other Guard tries to
          drag the metal door shut. He hits a fleshy door jam - Burton.
          Hanna is upon him. Two shots.

          70 INT. LANGLEY. OPERATIONAL HQ. CONT. 70

          MARISSA watches HANNA aim straight at camera. HANNA'S fierce
          eyes looking at her, MARISSA cant help but pull away from the
          screen. HANNA fires and the screen goes blank.

          71 INT. CAMP G. OBSERVATION ROOM. CONT. 71

          LEWIS watches as, one after another, his camera's go down.
          But still there's no sign of HANNA.

                         LEWIS
          She's a child for Christsake!

          72 INT. CAMP G. CORRIDOR IN SECURE BRIEFING AREA. 72

          Alarms are sounding and red lights flashing in the corridor.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.
          HANNA walks fast along the corridor. She ducks into a door to
          avoid two Centre Guards running past, dives down another
          corridor and walks through a pair of double doors with
          warning signs on them. PROTECTED ENVIRONMENT - CLASSIFIED

          PROGRAMME.

          73 INT. CAMP G. MILITARY LABORATORY. CONT. 73

          She finds herself in the specialist Military DNA Laboratory.
          The MILITARY DOCTORS stare at her. One of them reaches for an
          alarm but HANNA is too fast. She flies across the desk and
          smashing a glass test tube, she cuts the doctor's neck, then
          turns and does the same to the other one.
          HANNA looks round, trying to find a way out. Then she sees
          something on the desk. It is a file with a photo of herself
          clipped to it and a collection of papers - she scans it and
          reads in several places the letters âDNA.â
          But before she has time to read properly, she hears a female
          voice from outside the lab.

                         FEMALE GUARD
          This is Sanders. I'm checking Zone
          eleven.
          The FEMALE GUARD radios off, then enters. She senses
          something.
          POV SANDERS - The DNA laboratory suddenly seems empty. The
          buzz of the lab's lighting and the whir of the air-
          pressurizes are the only sounds as the GUARD looks around.
          Then the GUARD hears a rustling from behind her and tenses
          up.
          She turns around but HANNA has vanished into thin air, there
          is silence.

          74 INT. CAMP G. CORRIDOR IN SECURE BRIEFING CENTRE. 74

          HANNA, runs along the corridor. She has in her hands the DNA
          results which she scrunches up and jams into a pocket.

          75 INT. CAMP G. AIR-CONDITIONING DUCT ABOVE CORRIDOR. CONT. 75

          HANNA eyes the vent above her. She peers around a corner -
          her only other route of escape and sees:

          76 INT. CAMP G. CORRIDOR. CONT. 76

          MILITARY PERSONNEL reach the intersection close to HANNA and
          spread out, all going in different directions but none coming
          towards her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.
          The last pair of personnel start heading towards her. She
          looks up at the duct again and a length of ducting along the
          wall, about waist height.
          She puts a foot on a rail, halls herself up towards the vent.
          She fiddles with the vent, eventually opening it as the
          personnel are almost upon her.

          77 INT. CAMP G. AIR-CONDITIONING VENT. CONT. 77

          She crawls through the narrow air-conditioning duct. She
          stops, alert to the sounds beneath her. Through small
          perforations in a vent she sees more MILITARY PERSONNEL
          running down the corridor.

          78 INT. CAMP G. AIR-CONDITIONING DUCT ABOVE CORRIDOR. CONT. 78

          The duct bends to a vertical angle. She begins to crawl up a
          steep gradient towards a crack of light.

          79 INT. CAMP G. OBSERVATION ROOM. 79

          LEWIS sits in silence. MONITOR looks at him nervously.

                         MONITOR
          You think she's out?

                         LEWIS
          She can't get out.
          LEWIS picks up an internal telephone.

          LEWIS (CONT'D)

                         (INTO TELEPHONE)
          Who's on the perimeter? Detail
          every unit available.

          80 INT. CAMP G. AIR-CONDITIONING VENT. CONT. 80

          HANNA is sweating, exhausted, blinking in the darkness,
          trying to make out what the light source is.
          The gradient has got steeper and she starts to slide
          backwards on the smooth metal surface. She digs her fingers
          into the rivets joining the plates of stainless steel, trying
          to get a purchase.
          She summons the last of her strength and reaches a crest. She
          rests a moment, then hauls herself over the crest and
          immediately starts sliding... she tumbles, gathering pace,
          falling down a long chute into the blackness. She has no idea
          where she is or what's happening, but she's covering a lot of
          ground.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.
          She hits the bottom with a crunch and cries out.
          When she opens her eyes she sees more tunnel - and at the end
          light. She crawls quickly towards it and stops at a kind of
          manhole cover with a sprung lever - she wrenches the lever
          and pushes against it. After a little effort the cover gives
          way and light floods in, blinding her.
          HANNA recovers and tentatively pokes her head out into:

          81 EXT. MOROCCO/DESERT. CONT. 81

          BLAZING SUN - HANNA's pale face appears, eyes crinkled shut.
          Wider - HANNA emerges from a hole in the ground in the middle
          of a sandblasted desert and slams the cover closed. Total
          silence now, except for the whistle of the wind on sand. It
          takes her eyes a moment to adjust to the blinding light.
          Blearily she looks out across this alien environment.
          After a moment her ears prick up. She turns just in time to
          see a column of Military Jeeps rise over a sand dune in the
          distance behind her. The jeeps are crawling straight towards
          her, ominously shimmering in the desert heat. She quickly
          ducks back down into her rabbit hole and waits.

          82 EXT. MOROCCAN DESERT 82

          In the middle of the desert the soldiers convene, looking for
          HANNA. A military truck is stationery. Nothing around for
          miles. We hear a military voice on a radio.

          MILITARY VOICE (V.O.)
          473 are you receiving me? Can you
          confirm your position. Subject has
          escaped.

          83 EXT. MOROCCAN DESERT. DAY. 83

          The truck moves off a short distance and stops again.
          Meanwhile a large convoy of Military Vehicles passes right
          over HANNA. When it has past she sees the first vehicle
          crawling to a halt right near the hole - just yards away.
          One of the MILITARY PERSONNEL in the jeep gets out and goes
          over to the hole, lifts the lid, inspects the darkness.
          The Truck radio is on and we hear the voice.

                         MILITARY VOICE
          Can you confirm your position 473?
          Banks? Banks can you hear me?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.
          Once BANKS is satisfied he walks away a few paces, gets out a
          pair of high powered binoculars, looks this way and that.
          He walks up a dune and scans the dunes with his binoculars.
          Finally he walks back and climbs into the Jeep, gets on the
          radio.

          BANKS.
          I'm at a perimeter opening at the
          far east wing. Something's not
          quite right...
          He doesn't notice but the lid is open now and the air-
          conditioning duct is empty.

                         CUT TO:
          As the Jeep moves off we see HANNA is clinging to the axle,
          hanging upside down underneath. Her face is pressed to the
          oily metal, her back just an inch from the desert floor
          flashing beneath her.
          The jeeps now take a track along the edge of a steep dune.
          HANNA takes her chance and lets go of her grip. She clenches
          her eyes shut as the jeep passes over her. As soon as the
          jeeps clears she rolls herself over the edge of the dune.
          HANNA rolls down the sand dune at speed until finally she
          slows and stops. She lies still and shocked by the quiet as
          the Jeep disappears into the distance. Then she sits up and
          looks around herself. She has no conception of this
          landscape, no idea where she might be.

          84 INT. MARISSA'S APARTMENT. VIRGINIA. USA - NIGHT 84

          MARISSA moves between her wardrobe and a suitcase packing
          clothes, underwear, another power suit.
          Fully packed she goes to the back of the wardrobe and pulls
          aside some dresses to reveal a hidden safe. She keys in the
          security code, the safe door opens and from the back of the
          safe Marissa retrieves a blue file.
          MARISSA looks at the files title in large blunt letters:

          GALINKA.

          85 EXT. FOREST ROAD - FLASHBACK 85

          FLASHBACK to 1995.
          A much younger MARISSA watching a very fast-moving car on a
          deserted forest road. She takes from her pocket a small
          detonating device and as the car approaches a bend, presses
          it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.
          There is a small explosion and the car swerves off the road
          and smashes headlong into a post. The horn starts to blare.
          MARISSA approaches the car. The road is empty. MARISSA looks
          through binoculars at the car.
          She sees a woman, on the passenger side, head thrust forward.
          JOHANNA ZADEK. Blood everywhere. MARISSA shoots her in the
          head just to be sure. But the driver's seat is empty. MARISSA
          stops dead.
          Then the back door opens on the other side. A man, a younger
          ERIK HELLER crawls out. He is holding a two year old child in
          his hands. The child's coat is covered in blood.
          MARISSA stares at the shocked child and takes the rifle to
          her eye to shoot again. As she does, ERIK senses her movement
          and throws himself to the ground.
          Through the rifle viewfinder we see just a glimpse of ERIK
          and the red glare of the coat covered in blood, ERIK HELLER
          grabbing the child and sprinting for the forest,
          MARISSA taking aim at HELLER, and then firing as HELLER dives
          into the forest.

          86 INT. MARISSA'S APARTMENT. VIRGINIA. USA - NIGHT 86


          PRESENT DAY.
          MARISSA puts on a pair of rubber kitchen gloves and sets fire
          to the file in the sink.
          When it's all burnt up she switches on the garbage disposal
          and pushes the ashen remains down the gurgler with a dish
          mop.

          87 EXT. MOROCCAN DESERT - LATER 87

          The sun has dipped a little now, the shadows of the dunes are
          longer, but the heat is still intense.
          HANNA's throat is parched by the dry heat, her pale eyes
          scorched by the angry sun. She walks purposefully but with a
          growing awareness of her tiny scale in this seemingly endless
          sea of sand. She has no conception of this landscape, no idea
          where she might be.

                         HANNA

                         (MUTTERING)
          I live in Leipzig. German city...
          0.7 Million people... I go to
          school at the Klaus Kohle
          Gymnasium... literature and
          sport... I have a dog called Trudi.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.
          HANNA climbs a steep dune, eyes down, feet pounding. A shadow
          falls across her path and she looks up to see the shape of a
          GIRL standing at the top of the dune silhouetted by the sun.
          HANNA's hand goes to the concealed gun.
          The GIRL stares at HANNA. They must be about the same age
          but there the resemblance ends. HANNA, dusty, bloodied and
          bruised in military top, trousers and boots stares at this
          perfect image of western adolescence. Dressed head to toe
          in pink and drinking a can of coke, no concession to where
          she is whatsoever. This is SOPHIE LYALL.

                         SOPHIE
          Hello.
          HANNA stares at her, then abruptly turns to walk in opposite
          direction until she sees another convoy of US military trucks
          in the distance.

          SOPHIE (CONT'D)
          All right?
          HANNA turns back. Looks at SOPHIE. Like a wary animal.

          SOPHIE (CONT'D)
          Don't you speak English?
          HANNA is unsure how to speak to this strange person.

          SOPHIE (CONT'D)
          That can't be helped. You look
          terrible.
          At that moment SOPHIE'S brother, MILES, eight years old,
          rises over the dune and stands by SOPHIE'S side. In his hand
          is a stills camera, not digital, film. MILES stares at HANNA
          while talking to SOPHIE.

                         MILES
          Who's she?

                         SOPHIE
          I don't know. I just found her.

                         MILES
          What's her name?

                         SOPHIE
          She can't talk.

                         HANNA
          Hanna.

                         MILES
          She talked.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.

                         HANNA
          I live in Leipzig. German city.
          Population 0.7 Million people. We
          live at Number 7 Weissingerplatz. I
          go to school at the Klaus Kohle
          Gymnasium and my best friends are
          Rudi Gunter and Clara Schliess. I
          like literature and sport, in
          particular tennis and athletics.

                         MILES

                         (RE' HANNA)
          She's weird.

                         HANNA
          I also have a dog called Trudi.

                         MILES
          We had a dog called Vincent, but he
          went mad and died.

                         SOPHIE
          I'm Sophie and this is my brother,
          Shit for Brains.
          From over the dune comes the voice of SOPHIE and MILES'S
          mother, RACHEL LYALL.

          RACHEL (O.S.)
          Come on, Sophie! We'll miss the
          light.
          MILES raises his camera to his eye and snaps a picture of

          HANNA.

                         MILES
          Bye.

                         SOPHIE
          See you.
          SOPHIE takes one more puzzled look at HANNA, then turns and
          disappears over the sand dune.
          HANNA rises to the top of the dune. SOPHIE turns back to

          HANNA.

          SOPHIE (CONT'D)
          Do you need a lift somewhere?

                         HANNA
          No. I prefer to walk.

                         SOPHIE
          Suit yourself.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.
          SOPHIE and MILES head back towards their nouveau hippy
          parents, RACHEL and SEBASTIAN LYALL who are waiting for them
          beside an old VAN parked by a tarmac road that cuts straight
          through the desert.

          88 INT. AEROPLANE - NIGHT. 88

          MARISSA sitting in first class, trying to hide the fact that
          she's on her cell phone mid-flight. There's turbulence.

          LEWIS(O.O.V)
          She's in the desert east of
          Essouiara.

                         MARISSA
          Have you got the DNA results?

                         LEWIS
          We can't find them. It's possible
          she has them on her.
          Marissa takes that in.

                         MARISSA
          Okay. I want you to focus on Erik
          Heller.

          LEWIS (O.O.V)
          Why?
          A sweet-faced male AIR STEWARD hovers over MARISSA.

                         AIR STEWARD
          Excuse Madame, airline regulations
          state that -

                         MARISSA
          I'm in conference.

                         AIR STEWARD
          All the same -

                         MARISSA
          Back off, honey. I'm busy.
          MARISSA'S response is so fierce that the AIR STEWARD
          instinctively does as he's told.

          LEWIS (O.O.V)
          You know this isn't going to go
          away.

                         MARISSA
          I'm dealing with it Lewis.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.

          LEWIS (O.O.V)
          Okay but I just want you to admit -
          my Lord - how did she know to ask
          for you?
          She hangs up.

          89 EXT. DESERT/OASIS TOWN - DUSK 89

          HANNA walking along the side of a tarmac desert road,
          approaching a dusty oasis town.
          HANNA enters the outskirts, teaming with scooters, trucks,
          taxis, mules and goats. The impact knocks HANNA backwards,
          assailed by the smells of dried fruit, meat tagines, couscous
          cooking at market stalls, fresh fish and meat, still bloody
          and twitching, hanging in the sun for the flies. She listens
          to the babble of Arabic, her ears, nose and eyes sensitive to
          every conversation and twitch of life. It all overpoweringly
          exotic and visceral to her.
          An old broken-backed woman inches her way to market. HANNA
          stares at her in astonishment. Her wrinkled skin.
          She eyes the abundance of animals - animals she's never seen
          before in her life: Chickens. Goats. A camel, which Hanna
          finds bizarre and hilarious.

          90 INT. CENTRE OF TOWN/NIGHT MARKET - EVENING 90

          HANNA finds a stall with simple cotton clothing. She chooses
          some cheap clothes and unseen goes around the back of the
          stall. She changes out of her ragged old clothes into her new
          clothes.
          HANNA sees MILES running through the crowds carrying a bag of
          cherries.
          She follows him a little way, onto a busy street with hotels
          and cheap jewellery stores.
          He runs up the steps and enters a small mid-range hotel.
          HANNA looks up at the hotel, then enters.

          91 INT. MOROCCAN HOTEL RECEPTION - EVENING 91

          HANNA stands at the reception desk. A kindly looking HOTEL
          OWNER is eating a jammy biscuit. He's a little confused by

          HANNA.

                         HOTEL OWNER
          Where's your family?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

                         HANNA
          Are you Arab?

                         HOTEL OWNER
          I'm Moroccan.

                         HANNA
          Morocco. Capital city Rabat. Places
          of interest. Marrakesh. Essouaira.
          Religion Islam. Language Arabic
          (in Arabic w/ English

                         SUBTITLES)
          I like Arabic very much. It's like
          Japanese. It's big.
          The HOTEL OWNER nearly spits out his biscuit in shock.

                         HOTEL OWNER
          (in Arabic w/ English

                         SUBTITLES)
          You speak Arabic?

                         HANNA
          (in Arabic w/ English

                         SUBTITLES)
          Yes, of course.

                         HOTEL OWNER
          (in Arabic w/ English

                         SUBTITLES)
          Where's your family?

                         HANNA
          (in Arabic w/ English

                         SUBTITLES)
          I need a room for one night. Can
          you help? I don't have any money.

          92 INT. MOROCCAN HOTEL BEDROOM - EVENING 92

          The HOTEL OWNER leads HANNA into a simple whitewashed hotel
          room with twin beds.
          They speak in Arabic with English subtitles.

                         HOTEL OWNER
          It's the best we've got.

                         HANNA
          Thank you.
          HANNA stares at the light switch.

          HANNA (CONT'D)
          Do you have one of these in every
          room?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.

                         HOTEL OWNER
          Of course. All mod cons.

                         HANNA
          It's electricity?
          The HOTEL OWNER looks at HANNA askance.

                         HOTEL OWNER
          Yes.

                         HANNA
          I know a little bit about
          electricity. They say Edison
          discovered it, or was it Franklin?

                         HOTEL OWNER
          Some American, I'm sure.
          He picks up an electric kettle.

          HOTEL OWNER (CONT'D)
          Electric kettle for the English -
          they like to make their own tea.
          He switches it on, Hanna stares as it heats up noisily.
          He goes to a small wall mounted TV, switches it on for her, a
          fuzzy, terrible picture of an Arabic TV show. HANNA is
          fascinated, doesn't take her eyes off the TV as she sits on
          the edge of the bed.

                         HANNA
          What is it?

                         HOTEL OWNER
          It's the best we can do.
          She stares at the picture, bemused.

          HOTEL OWNER (CONT'D)
          Where do you come from?
          Distracted, HANNA is caught off guard.

                         HANNA
          The forest.
          The HOTEL OWNER smiles, himself a little puzzled by this
          strange encounter, and leaves.
          She just sits there staring at the TV as it's volume seems to
          increase.
          Meanwhile the electric kettle begins to boil. Steam pours
          from its spout and the whole contraption starts to rattle
          violently.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.
          HANNA gets up and approaches the kettle very warily. She
          tries the light switch in an attempt to stop the kettle, but
          it keeps boiling and making its strange rattle. HANNA tries
          another switch, the ceiling fan begins to turn, confusing
          HANNA even more.
          On the TV the news shows footage of war in the Middle East,
          the sound of gunfire.
          The ceiling fan is at its top speed, it's blades cut the air
          like a helicopter.
          A telephone beside the bed starts to ring.
          Combined the noises rise to a terrifying crescendo.
          HANNA backs away towards the bathroom. She stumbles and falls
          through the bathroom door straight into the shower,
          inadvertently turning the taps on. Water pours down on her.
          HANNA springs up and turns to face the stream of water as if
          it were an attacker. She runs back into the bedroom.
          In the bedroom the kettle is still having a violent tantrum,
          the TV is still screaming, the fan still cutting, the phone
          still shouting.
          HANNA pulls at the exit door, but doesn't know to turn the
          handle. She panics. Smashes at the door. Eventually she falls
          through the door and into the corridor.

          93 INT. MOROCCAN HOTEL CORRIDOR - EVENING 93

          Silence as HANNA sits on the corridor floor catching her
          breath.
          A little way down the corridor MILES and SOPHIE emerge from
          their bedroom.

                         MILES
          Look. It's that girl.
          He nudges SOPHIE.
          HANNA eyes them suspiciously.

                         SOPHIE
          Hey you made it.

                         MILES
          Hey, again.

                         SOPHIE
          Did you walk here?

                         MILES
          She looks different.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

                         SOPHIE
          Do you want to hang with us?

                         MILES
          Are you hungry?

                         SOPHIE
          Miles is always hungry.

                         HANNA
          I'm thirsty.

          94 EXT/INT. STRIP CLUB. HAMBURG. 94

          The Reeperbaln, the main street of Hamburg's red light
          district. Tough and unglamorous. MARISSA WIEGLER gets out of
          a taxi, checks the sign of the strip club and crosses the
          road. She is on the phone and we hear.

          LEWIS (O.S.)
          The Swedish borders are sealed. I
          have Swedish, Norwegian and Danish
          border patrols on high alert and
          Interpol have briefed the police.

                         MARISSA
          I don't want any bad news Lewis.
          Neither of us can afford a fuck up.
          MARISSA hangs up. She enters a converted car park which is
          now a lap dancing bar. It's early in the day and the patrons
          are as scarce as the clothes on the dancers.
          At the far end of the room is the reason Marissa is there,
          MICHAEL ISAACS. Mid fifties. Rumpled suit, bleary, unshaven
          and drinking a scotch.
          ISAACS smiles coldly at MARISSA.

                         ISAACS
          I didn't think they let women in
          here.

                         MARISSA
          They let them in, they just don't
          let them get dressed.
          He smiles, drinks, she eyes the scotch.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          Still drinking on the job. You
          haven't changed.

                         ISAACS
          You have.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.

                         MARISSA
          Adapt or die.

                         ISAACS
          You want a drink?

                         MARISSA
          I'll wait until I really need one.
          He grins and drinks. She sits, with a sigh, looks him in the
          eye.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          Erik Heller's still alive.
          ISAACS glances up from his drink.

                         ISAACS
          You don't say.

                         MARISSA
          There's more.
          MARISSA passes him a newspaper. He opens it. Hidden inside is
          a picture of Hanna. He looks it over, surprised.

                         ISAACS (IRONIC)
          Wow. All grown up.

                         MARISSA
          He did a good job.

                         ISAACS
          Did she turn out like you hoped?

                         MARISSA
          She just tried to kill me.

                         ISAACS
          Isn't it always the way?

                         MARISSA
          The fuck does that mean?

                         ISAACS
          You bring them into this world,
          teach them how to kill and maim...
          and then they turn against you.

                         MARISSA
          I didn't teach her.

                         ISAACS
          No, it's better than that. You bred
          her from a test tube.
          MARISSA turns to the BARMAN and signals for a round of the
          scotches, âTwo of these...â

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.

                         MARISSA
          Here's the problem: She thinks we
          killed her mother.
          He smiles wryly.

                         ISAACS
          Just get her sectioned or
          something.

                         MARISSA
          Sure, just as soon as she's done
          breaking peoples necks. You get her
          sectioned, if you can catch her.
          The drinks arrive, MARISSA drinks.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          Right now she's in Morocco but
          she'll be trying to get out of the
          country. Find her and bring her to
          me. Quietly.

                         ISAACS
          I'll need funds.
          MARISSA slides an envelope of bills across the table.

                         MARISSA
          Don't spend it all on candy.
          She glances meaningfully at the STRIPPERS, who have been
          eyeing up ISAACS as a potential mark.
          ISAACS looks at the money. When he looks back up MARISSA is
          already walking out the door.

          95 EXT. NIGHT MARKET RESTAURANT. OASIS TOWN - NIGHT 95

          HANNA is sitting at a table with the FAMILY who are all
          eating falafel while HANNA eats meat.
          SOPHIE and MILES parents, RACHEL and SEB, have some
          difficulty relating to their daughters attitudes. They belong
          to a generation of counter cultural radicals whose priorities
          have, over the past decade, shifted and they're now trying to
          assimilate into mainstream society whilst still holding on to
          their ideals of autonomy and social liberation.
          SOPHIE is describing a recent cultural phenomenon while she
          picks at her food.

                         SOPHIE
          She's beautiful. I wish I had a
          body like hers. She's really cool
          too. She's married to a footballer
          and really loves him -

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.
          Meanwhile HANNA eyes the crowd, constantly on the look out.

          SOPHIE (CONT'D)
          - only the papers found out he was
          shagging like loads of other girls
          so she went and got all successful
          in her own right and now does a
          make-over show where she turns
          right dogs into real babes. I could
          do you a make-over if you'd like?

                         RACHEL
          Perhaps Hanna doesn't want a make-
          over, sweetie.
          SOPHIE ignores RACHEL and addresses all her responses to

          HANNA.

                         SOPHIE
          Rachel doesn't believe in making
          the best of yourself.

                         RACHEL
          No Sophie, I just don't believe
          fourteen year-old girls should be
          dressing to look like porn stars.
          It objectifies them.

                         SOPHIE

                         (TO HANNA)
          Do you shave your armpits yet?

                         HANNA
          I don't think so.

                         RACHEL
          Good. Keep it that way.

                         SOPHIE
          That's SOOO gross.

                         RACHEL
          Do you often travel on your own,
          Hanna?

                         HANNA
          My father encourages me to be
          independent.

                         SEB
          And your mother?

                         HANNA
          She's dead.

                         SEB
          Oh, I'm sorry.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.

                         SOPHIE
          Nice one, Dad.

                         HANNA
          People die.

                         MILES
          What did she die of?

                         HANNA
          Three bullets.

                         RACHEL
          Oh. God. How terrible.
          SOPHIE is weirdly impressed.

          96 EXT/INT. BUTCHERS SHOP. SOUTH SWEDEN - NIGHT 96

          ERIK HELLER, still wearing his three piece suit, enters a
          tiny provincial Swedish butchers shop and walks up to the
          counter. He checks around to make sure no one is following
          him before approaching the BUTCHER and slapping some cash on
          the counter.

                         HELLER
          Three pounds of goose fat if you
          please.

          97 INT. MOROCCAN HOTEL CORRIDOR - LATER 97

          HANNA arrives back at the hotel with RACHEL, SEB, MILES and
          SOPHIE. MILES is sleepy and SOPHIE a little grumpy.

                         SOPHIE
          Why do we always have to get up so
          early?

                         SEB
          If you were a Berber shepherd -

                         SOPHIE
          - I'm not a shepherd. Jesus.

                         RACHEL
          We have to be at the port by eight
          tomorrow so I want you to pack
          now...

                         MILES
          I'm too sleepy.
          HANNA listens anxiously, knowing she needs to go with them to
          be safe.
          She arrives at her door.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.

                         HANNA
          Good night.
          But the family are too wrapped up in their discussion to
          notice her.

                         SEB
          No, you're not. Come on we'll do it
          together.
          HANNA enters her room. SOPHIE turns at the sound of HANNA'S
          door closing.

                         SOPHIE
          She's weird. Is it me, or is that
          girl weird?

          98 INT. MOROCCAN HOTEL BEDROOM - NIGHT 98

          The TV flickers illuminating HANNA as she sits on her bed
          looking at the DNA report folded up into a tight wad. She
          smooths it out and reads.
          The test reads: HANNA HELLER - âSGM + test results.
          Interfering sequence present. Abnormal. B sample confirms

                         RESULTÂ
          HANNA stares at the words. âInterfering sequence present.
          Abnormal.â HANNA looks at the photo of herself and those
          words.

                         HANNA

                         ÂABNORMALÂ
          What does it mean?
          She looks up at the TV and sees footage of millions of Muslim
          worshipers circling the Kaaba at Mecca. The sheer mass of
          humanity stuns her. HANNA turns up the volume and hears the
          call to prayer.
          She listens in wonder to her first experience of music.

          HANNA (CONT'D)

                         (WHISPERS)
          Music. A combination of sounds with
          a view to beauty of form and
          expression of emotion.
          She breathes in the beautiful sounds.

          99 EXT. SOUTH SWEDISH COAST - PRE-DAWN 99

          The music continues over -

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.
          A barren rocky outcrop on the South Swedish coast. HELLER
          arrives. He has a rucksack on his back.
          HELLER undresses and puts his suit in a plastic bag that he
          knots tight. He puts the bag into the rucksack and puts it on
          his back.
          Then HELLER starts to cover his body in the goose fat he
          bought in the butcher's. He stares across the water towards
          DENMARK in the distance.

          100 EXT. HOTEL CAR PARK. - PRE-DAWN 100

          HANNA appears in the blue morning light and stalks around the
          car park looking for the family van.
          When she finds it, she tries the doors but they're locked.
          She tries the back door but that's also locked.
          She gets her foot onto a wheel and another foot onto a
          doorhandle and climbs up onto the roof.

          101 EXT. VAN/ROOF - PRE-DAWN 101

          She studies the sun roof of the recreational vehicle. It has
          been left open a few inches for air.
          She gets her hands in there and tries to prise it open
          further but it's mechanised and won't budge.
          She looks around the car park for an implement.
          She spies a fire escape with a caretaker's nook next to it.
          She climbs back down off the van and goes to the caretaker's
          room.

          102 INT. CARETAKER'S ROOM - PRE-DAWN 102

          HANNA searches the tiny office until she finds a crowbar.

          103 EXT. FERRYPORT. MOROCCO. DAY 103

          A busy bustling ferry-port, cars in both directions.
          ISAACS looks round, makes silent contact with other men. His
          men. Four of them dotted around the ferryport.
          ISAACS approaches a BORDER GUARD. The GUARD is looking at a
          photocopied photo of HANNA from her holding cell. The GUARD
          pockets the photocopy as ISAACS passes him a wad of cash.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

          104 INT. VAN - DAY. 104

          THE FAMILY travels towards the ferry-port, sleepy and grumpy,
          yawning, looking around.
          The sun roof to the rear, above the breakfast table and bench
          seats, is wide open.

                         SEB
          ... Somebody broke the sun roof. I
          said somebody broke the sun roof.
          It won't close...

                         RACHEL
          Call the rental.

                         SEB
          I hope its insured.

          105 EXT. FERRYPORT. MOROCCO - CONTINUOUS 105

          ISAACS watches closely every car that approaches the ferry
          from behind his dark glasses.
          He sees the FAMILY have joined a cue of vehicles and are
          having their papers checked. Then they're waved on board. He
          scrutinises them but has no reason to suspect anything.

          106 INT. FERRY CAR DECK. - DAY 106

          Cars are parking, their headlights on in the dark hull, horns
          blowing, FERRY GUARDS directing people to parking spaces -
          it's chaos.
          SEB parks the van with some difficulty, complaining all the
          while.

                         SEB
          Typical. Get me back to the
          European Union.

                         RACHEL
          Don't be rude.
          They get out, taking with them anything they might need -
          knapsacks, computer games, suit cases.
          They head off towards the stairs up to the decks, passing
          ISAACS on their way.
          ISAACS searches between the cars and trucks.
          He passes the back of the FAMILY'S van as the camera pushes
          in on its back door. The handle is being JIGGLED FROM INSIDE.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.

          107 INT. VAN/FERRY CAR DECK - DAY 107

          Inside, the van is as the family left it, but the bench seats
          around the breakfast table are disturbed. One has been opened
          out, the lid taken off, the mattress strewn on the floor -
          inside is a big storage space where HANNA has evidently
          hidden... The crowbar has been discarded there.
          HANNA is trying to get out. She tries the back door but its
          locked.
          She climbs over the seats and climbs into the front cabin,
          the driver's seat. She finds a lock on the door and unlocks.
          She climbs out.

          108 EXT. LOWER FERRY DECK - DAY 108

          HANNA walks out on deck and sees the sea, the sight of it
          takes her breath away. She walks to the railings and looks
          over the edge. Then up at the seagulls following the boat.
          A little way off the FAMILY are sitting eating ice-creams.
          SOPHIE lies out on a bench sunning herself.

                         RACHEL
          What has got into you? Oh my God,
          look over there.
          They all look where she is pointing - at HANNA.

                         SOPHIE
          It's her.

                         SEB
          You think she... you don't think
          she... Rachel, the sunroof?

                         RACHEL
          You think we should say something?

                         SEB
          What's there to say?

                         RACHEL
          Maybe she's in trouble.

                         SEB
          Maybe she's a hooker. Or a
          terrorist. There's a lot of them in
          Germany.

                         SOPHIE
          Hookers or terrorists?

                         RACHEL
          I'll go over.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.

                         SEB
          Rachel, walk away. I'm insisting
          here. I'm putting my foot down...
          RACHEL heads off towards HANNA, SOPHIE follows.

                         CUT TO:
          SOPHIE and RACHEL approach HANNA and move to positions either
          side of her.

                         SOPHIE
          All right?

                         HANNA
          Did you know that 71 percent of the
          earths surface is covered in water?

                         SOPHIE
          My father thinks you're a stowaway.
          He thinks you broke our sunroof
          too, which puts you in deep shit.

                         RACHEL
          Sophie just - I'll handle this.

                         (TO HANNA)
          Where's your father?
          No reply.

          RACHEL (CONT'D)
          I really think it might help if you
          told us the, you know, the truth
          and all that. Have you run away
          from somewhere?

                         SOPHIE
          Are you okay?

                         HANNA
          I'm fine.

                         RACHEL
          I'm worried about you.

                         SOPHIE
          She said she's fine.

                         RACHEL
          You have to understand this really
          is a problem for us.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.

                         SOPHIE
          You know what? Why don't I stay
          here with her and you go off and be
          with dad? He's looking kind of
          tense.

                         CUT TO:
          RACHEL rejoins SEB and MILES.

                         SEB
          Has she even got a passport?!

                         RACHEL
          I don't think I handled that very
          well.

                         SEB
          How do you know she's not some kind
          of illegal immigrant?

          109 EXT. UPPER FERRY DECK - CONTINUOUS 109

          ISAACS searches the upper deck. Through the bar on the other
          side of the ferry he sees one of his men searching the
          opposite deck.
          A CHILD knocks into ISAACS and the few photocopied
          photographs he has of HANNA fall from his pocket and are
          blown along the deck.
          ISAACS scrambles to pick-up the photocopies.

          110 EXT. LOWER FERRY DECK - CONTINUOUS 110

          HANNA and SOPHIE are still standing at the railings. SOPHIE
          offers HANNA some of her ice-cream.

                         SOPHIE
          Would you like some?
          HANNA looks curiously at the ice-cream.

                         HANNA
          Please.
          She tries it.

          HANNA (CONT'D)
          It tastes like music.

                         SOPHIE
          You're so weird, aren't you? Did
          you have a fight with your dad or
          something?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.

                         HANNA
          Yes.

                         SOPHIE
          Was it bad?

                         HANNA
          No. I won.
          HANNA studies the sea.

          HANNA (CONT'D)
          Can you help me get home?
          At that moment one of ISAACS photocopied pictures of HANNA
          rolls across the deck and catches on the railings.
          HANNA looks down at it, recognizes herself and quickly
          pockets it. She looks across the deck, too many people, she
          shouldn't have let herself be so exposed.

          HANNA (CONT'D)
          You could do me a make-over if you
          like?

          111 INT. VAN. FERRY CAR DECK - DAY 111

          MILES is sitting in the driver's seat, pretending to drive
          the stationary van.
          Through the windscreen, RACHEL and SEB can be seen having a
          heated discussion.
          In the back, HANNA is changing into some of SOPHIE'S clothes.

                         SOPHIE
          You're pretty. You know that?

                         HANNA
          Am I?

                         SOPHIE
          Of course you are. You've got
          pretty eyes and you're tall. I
          always wanted to be tall. If I were
          a man I might fancy you.
          She laughs. HANNA responds seriously.

                         HANNA
          I'm not a man.
          SOPHIE laughs even more.
          The door swings open and SEB is standing there with RACHEL,
          nervous but determined.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.

                         SEB
          Okay, here's the deal. We're going
          to find a way to get you home just
          as soon as we get off this crate.
          But since you don't have a passport
          with you right now, we're just
          going to have to be a bit gorilla.
          Okay?

                         RACHEL
          We passionately believe it's the
          right thing to do.
          They don't look sure at all, but SOPHIE puts her arm round
          HANNA and HANNA returns the gesture, everybody slightly
          embarrassed.

          112 EXT. FERRY PORT ALGECIRAS - DAY 112

          The FERRY is docked, the huge doors are open and cars are
          starting to drive out, halting on the dock to have passports
          checked.

          113 INT. VAN. FERRY CAR DECK. - DAY 113

          Cars are revving up, manoeuvring and getting ready to
          disembark.
          RACHEL is at the drivers wheel while SEB is in the back
          stripping the cushions from the bench seats to prepare a
          place for HANNA to hide.
          HANNA waits, breath bated, her arm round SOPHIE's shoulders.
          On the far side she sees ISAACS enter the deck. She watches
          him carefully and decides he must be looking for her. She
          ducks down a little further.
          RACHEL, looking nervous, turns to HANNA.

                         RACHEL
          You okay honey?

                         HANNA
          Yes yes I'm ready!
          ISAACS is getting closer, walking between the cars. The ferry
          gates are open and the noise subsides.
          SEB discovers the crowbar, examines it.

                         SEB
          Oh Jesus.
          HANNA grabs it and sticks it back in the box, helps SEB fling
          cushions aside and gets into the compartment.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.
          SEB grits his teeth.

          SEB (CONT'D)
          Here goes nothing.
          He shuts the bench seat over HANNA and replaces the cushions
          just as ISAACS passes the van, sniffing around.
          SEB gets out of the back and walks around to the front. He
          passes ISAACS on his way round.

          SEB (CONT'D)
          Excuse me. Sir?
          ISAACS gets out of the way and SEB gets into the front
          passenger's seat. RACHEL starts the engine, checks her
          mirrors.
          SEB eyes ISAACS with some paranoia - although he has no idea
          who he is.

          INSIDE HANNA'S HIDE OUT -
          HANNA lies quietly, her eyes glistening in the dark. She
          listens, hearing the van disembarking the ferry.

          114 EXT. DANISH COASTLINE - DAY 114

          Dark rain pours down on to a beach on the Danish coast.
          A figure struggles to land. Then, like a monster from the
          deep, ERIK emerges out of the surf. His lungs bursting with
          the exertion. Water dripping from his body.
          He collapses for a while then stumbles up the beach. He
          approaches the beach car park.
          A POLICE CAR swings into the car park.
          ERIK tries to run, but it's too late. The POLICE CAR is on
          him.
          He stops and turns towards the police car.
          TWO POLICEMEN get out of the car and approach ERIK. He
          watches them very carefully.

          115 EXT. MOTORWAY/SOUTHERN SPAIN - DAY 115

          The FAMILY'S van speeds along the E-15 up from the Bay of
          Gibraltar, heading north east towards the mountains.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.

          116 INT. VAN - DAY 116

          HANNA stares out at the changing light in the rugged
          landscape.
          Hills are emerging and the land is turning green in the gold
          evening light.
          HANNA watches RACHEL unscrew the cap of a water bottle and
          brings it to SEB'S mouth while he drives. SEB laughs as a
          little water spills down his front.
          SOPHIE is listening to an iPOD. HANNA looks at her. SOPHIE
          takes one earphone out of her own ear and puts it in HANNA's.

          117 INT. MARITIME SECURITY/OFFICE - DAY 117

          ISAACS shows fake ID to the ferry's frowning SECURITY
          OFFICER, who doesn't appreciate the unsolicited approach.

                         ISAACS
          Sir, I'll be as brief as I can, we
          have a situation here...

          118 INT. MARITIME SECURITY/OFFICE - LATER 118

          ISAACS is studying CC TV footage of the ferry. He views a
          number of scenes with no luck until he notices:
          The car deck - HANNA and SOPHIE weaving through the cars and
          boarding the van.

          119 INT. VAN - DAY 119

          HANNA rests her head on SOPHIE'S shoulder and relaxes for the
          first time. MILES relaxes his head on HANNA's shoulder and
          they stare at the huge, granite mountain range...
          She starts to nod off... she falls asleep on SOPHIE's
          shoulder.

          120 EXT. DANISH COASTLINE - DAY 120

          MARISSA walks along the desolate patch of coastline. She
          approaches a Crime Scene. Dogs, markings on the ground. Two
          DANISH POLICEMEN lie inert on the pebbles, their throats
          freshly sliced.

                         LEWIS
          The Danish authorities are taking
          this very seriously. They've
          doubled the number of officers on
          the ground. We've sent up spotter
          planes over the channel.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.

                         LEWIS (CONT'D)
          They're appealing for witnesses
          through the local media...
          MARISSA nods and looks out at the roiling grey sea. The
          reality of ERIK'S determination unnerving her.

          LEWIS (CONT'D)
          You think he really swam it?
          MARISSA knows he did. She calls over her shoulder as she
          walks away.

                         MARISSA
          Keep me posted.

          121 EXT. SPANISH CAMPSITE - DAY 121

          The campsite is heaving with humanity, thousands of EUROPEAN
          CAMPERS who have turned the site into what amounts to a
          shanty town - a small city with its own shops, drainage,
          borders and rules. Families come here from cities across
          Europe and bring their whole lives with them.
          The LYALL FAMILY van is squeezed in between a GERMAN family
          walking around in skimpy swimming costumes - and a serious
          looking FRENCH family with quad bikes.
          SOPHIE, MILES and HANNA stare at the other families a moment.

          GERMAN CAMPER.
          Guten tag.

                         HANNA
          Guten Morgen.

          GERMAN CAMPER.
          Wie geht es Ihnen?

                         HANNA
          Gutm und Ihnen?

          GERMAN CAMPER.
          Jah, gut, gut...
          A FRENCH CAMPER nods at them.

          FRENCH CAMPER.
          Bonjour. Ca va?

                         HANNA
          Ca va. Oui. Bien...
          HANNA starts efficiently helping SEB erect the children's
          tent. He's watches impressed as HANNA expertly ties
          complicated knots.
          RACHEL and MILES start blowing up two inflatable mattresses.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

                         RACHEL
          Maybe we could all go for a walk
          when we've put the tent up.

                         SOPHIE
          No thanks.
          HANNA looks off to the tree line. In the distance she spots a
          couple of RABBITS in a pool of sunlight.

          122 INT. SPANISH CAMPSITE. OFFICE/SHOP. 122

          HANNA turns a display unit of postcards.
          Through the window she can see SOPHIE talking to TWO TEENAGE

          BOYS.
          One of the boys enters the shop. He looks at HANNA as he
          passes and smiles. This is FELICIANO. He is handsome. HANNA'S
          not used to this feeling of being looked at.
          While the SHOP ASSISTANT serves FELICIANO HANNA pockets a
          postcard and a book of stamps.

          123 EXT. SPANISH CAMPSITE. OFFICE/SHOP. 123

          HANNA sits on a low wall writing her postcard:
          âMission accomplished'
          HANNA gets up and posts the card.

          124 EXT. WOODS NEAR CAMPSITE - DAY 124

          RACHEL and HANNA are walking in the woods together. Above
          them the evening chorus is in full song.

                         RACHEL
          I just feel connected when I'm in
          the countryside. The city stifles
          me... emotionally, creatively.
          HANNA'S attention is elsewhere, she's spotted something in
          the undergrowth.

          RACHEL (CONT'D)
          Anyway, I was very young when I...
          Seb and I.... He was so impressive.
          HANNA suddenly runs into the woods.

          RACHEL (CONT'D)
          Hanna?!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

          125 EXT. SPANISH CAMPSITE - EVENING 125

          The FAMILY are sitting in fold-out chairs eating charred
          veggie sausages.

                         SOPHIE
          It's probably just a bunch of
          Spanish farmers, mum. We're hardly
          going to be out all night.

                         RACHEL
          You're not going, Sophie. No way,
          Jose.
          HANNA appears from the woods carrying TWO SKINNED RABBITS.
          She lays them in front of the family.

                         HANNA
          Food.
          SOPHIE lets out a shriek of nervous laughter, while SEB and
          RACHEL are confused as to what the appropriate reaction might
          be.

                         MILES
          That's gross.

          126 INT. CAMPSITE PUBLIC BATHROOM - NIGHT 126

          The girls are hiding out in the Ladies Room as SOPHIE does
          HANNA'S make-up.

                         SOPHIE
          I don't know why I'm doing this,
          you're going to steal all the best
          men off of me.

                         HANNA
          What do you mean?

                         SOPHIE
          Though quite frankly I don't need
          more digits than I've got right
          now. Loads. Loads and loads.
          HANNA watches herself in the mirror. Mascara, eye liner. She
          licks the lipstick, puzzled. Almost a woman, but it doesn't
          look right on her.

                         HANNA
          It's like paint.

                         SOPHIE
          Don't lick it off.
          SOPHIE finishes HANNA's face, looks at her in the mirror.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

          SOPHIE (CONT'D)
          You're gorgeous.

          127 EXT. CAMPSITE. NIGHT. 127

          SOPHIE and HANNA sneak through the campsite together and move
          secretly between the parked cars. HANNA is dressed in some of
          SOPHIE's clothes and has the make-up on. They are excited,
          SOPHIE alive with the thrill of disobedience.

                         HANNA
          I can't walk in this.

                         SOPHIE
          You look hot.

                         HANNA
          Where are we going?

                         SOPHIE
          Shhhhh!
          HANNA uncomfortable with the situation.

                         HANNA
          I shouldn't take unnecessary risks.

                         SOPHIE
          Says who?
          SOPHIE heads off down the road.
          HANNA weighs the situation and then quickens her pace to
          catch up with SOPHIE.

          128 EXT. RAVE AT ROMAN AMPHITHEATRE. NIGHT. 128

          A loud out door rave in a Roman amphitheatre.
          SOPHIE and HANNA stand at the top of the amphitheatre looking
          down on the thrilling spectacle, soaking up the bass, the
          abstract sounds, the sheer volume, the pulsing lights and
          electric atmosphere - HANNA is thrilled and startled.
          Many of the crowd seem to be wearing fancy dress. HANNA
          stares at a girl dressed as a red ladybird.

                         CUT TO:
          The girls approach a bar and SOPHIE goes to order. She's
          forced to mime and shout her order over the music.

                         SOPHIE
          Vodka. Two.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.
          The bartender shakes his head and holds up two bottles of
          water.

                         BARTENDER
          Water only. No booze.
          Meanwhile HANNA spots FELICIANO, the handsome SPANISH BOY
          from the camp site shop, across the dance floor. He is
          staring at her again.
          SOPHIE comes back with two bottles of water and hands one to

          HANNA.

                         HANNA
          What do they call this music?

                         SOPHIE
          Banging.
          HANNA stares at the dancers, people losing themselves in it -
          SOPHIE just grins, starts to move to the music.
          HANNA smiles awkwardly, tries to copy SOPHIE.

                         CUT TO:
          ISAACS enters the rave followed by two of his HENCHMEN. They
          split up and start to survey the crowd.
          Over in a secluded corner ISAACS sees a drug deal taking
          place.
          ISAACS sidles over to the DEALER and his PUNTER. The PUNTER,
          thinking ISAACS is probably a cop, makes a hasty getaway.

                         ISAACS
          What you got?

                         DEALER
          (in Spanish w/ English

                         SUBTITLES)
          Nothing man. That guys just a
          friend.
          ISAACS frisks the DEALER, nothing. He turns the DEALER
          against the wall and checks his socks where he finds a stash
          of tiny baggies each containing a gram or two of white
          powder.
          ISAACS samples the powder and pockets the lot.

          DEALER (CONT'D)
          (in Spanish w/ English

                         SUBTITLES)
          Hey, you're not police. What the
          fuck?
          ISAACS turns as he walks away and puts a finger to his lips.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.

                         ISAACS
          Ssh.

                         CUT TO:
          Back near the bar HANNA and SOPHIE are approached by a couple
          of scrawny SPANISH BOYS in day-glow tops.

                         SPANISH BOY
          (in Spanish w/ English

                         SUBTITLES)
          Where are you from?
          The girls just look at each other.

          SPANISH BOY (CONT'D)
          English? American? You like to
          party?
          They watch, puzzled, as SOPHIE smiles disinterestedly and
          leads HANNA away.

                         HANNA
          Will you teach me to do dancing?

                         SOPHIE
          It's easy.
          HANNA and SOPHIE walk onto the dance floor and begin to
          dance.
          HANNA starts by dancing like a five year-old, swinging her
          arms jerkily and lifting her feet as if walking through a
          field. But soon her movements become more sophisticated and
          expressive.

                         CUT TO:
          ISAACS is searching through the crowd. He eyes the bodies
          around him greedily.
          He takes another dab of the white powder and rubs it into his
          gums.

                         CUT TO:
          Back on the dance floor, HANNA and SOPHIE are dancing.
          FELICIANO approaches through the crowd followed by a FRIEND.
          THEY start to circle HANNA and SOPHIE, dancing, insinuating
          their way in.

          SOPHIE (CONT'D)
          He's after you.

                         HANNA
          How can you tell?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.

                         SOPHIE
          Duh, look at the way he's looking
          at you. He's gorgeous.
          FELICIANO'S FRIEND approaches SOPHIE, he's not bad looking
          either.

          FELICIANO'S FRIEND
          What's your name?

                         SOPHIE
          Sophie.

          FELICIANO'S FRIEND
          Have you come here before?

                         SOPHIE
          All the time.

          FELICIANO'S FRIEND
          Really? You dance well.

                         SOPHIE
          So do you.
          HANNA and FELICIANO hold eye contact.
          The music rises and now they're lit only by the intermittent
          flashes of a strobe light.
          HANNA and FELICIANO begin to dance around each other, their
          movements caught in still flashes.

                         CUT TO:
          From some distance away ISAACS spots HANNA. He smiles and
          starts to move through the crowds towards her.

                         CUT TO:
          SOPHIE and the FRIEND are kissing. HANNA sees this and
          laughs.
          The crowd is jumping.
          HANNA feels FELICIANO'S hand take hers, she flinches a
          moment, then lets him draw her towards him. Their eyes still
          locked.
          ISAACS is getting closer, his eyes flashing eerily in the
          strobe lighting.
          HANNA and FELICIANO are in a world of their own.
          His fingers trace the lines of her arms, shoulders and neck.
          He draws her face towards his.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

                         HANNA
          Are we going to kiss now?

                         FELICIANO
          Would you like to?

                         HANNA
          Kissing requires a total of thirty-
          four facial muscles.
          Their lips are almost touching.

          HANNA (CONT'D)
          The most important muscle involved
          is the orbicularis oris muscle,
          which is used to pucker the lips -
          He kisses her.
          HANNA closes her eyes.
          ISAACS moves in.
          FELICIANO becomes more ardent, puts his arms around her
          waist, she doesn't like it. He tries to open her mouth with
          his.
          HANNA snaps.
          In a few swift moves, HANNA pulls FELICIANO round and throws
          him to the ground. She falls to his side and, with one knee
          on his back, she holds his head, about to snap his neck.
          SOPHIE turns and sees them on the ground. A few of the
          closest DANCERS also stop dancing and stare.
          ISAACS backs off, watching from a safe distance.

                         SOPHIE
          Hanna! Holy crap...

                         FELICIANO
          Please, don't hurt me.

                         (TO SOPHIE)
          Please, tell your friend...
          HANNA looks up at SOPHIE. Now that she has FELICIANO on the
          ground she doesn't know what to do with him.

                         HANNA
          Should I let him go?

                         SOPHIE
          As opposed to what? Yes, you should
          let him go.
          HANNA leans in to whisper into FELICIANO'S ear.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

                         HANNA
          I'm going to go now.

                         FELICIANO
          Sure.

                         HANNA
          It was nice.
          And she's gone, pulling SOPHIE away through the crowd.
          ISAACS jumps into action. But he's lost sight of the girls
          among the mass of dancing bodies.
          HANNA and SOPHIE move quickly through the crowds towards the
          exit.

                         SOPHIE
          Oh, my God, Hanna. I thought you
          were going to kill him. Where d'you
          learn to do that?

                         HANNA
          My father taught me.
          They escape through a hole in the perimeter fence.

                         129 129

                         NIGHT
          An immaculately tidy lounge in a small apartment on the
          ground floor of a run down East Berlin housing project.
          A well-dressed woman in her 60's, KATRIN, is sitting alone
          listening to music on an old casette machine.
          The door buzzer rings. KATRIN gets up slowly and approaches
          the door.

                         KATRIN
          Who is it?
          No reply. KATRIN puts the safety chain across the door and
          opens it a small amount.

                         MARISSA
          Hello Katrin.
          KATRIN slams the door shut in fright and double locks it.
          Fear racing through her veins, she rushes her way through the
          lounge, knocking furniture as she goes.

          130 INT. KITCHEN. KATRIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 130

          KATRIN races to the kitchen door and bolts it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.
          Thinking the apartment is secure, she tries to catch her
          breath. But slowly she becomes aware of someone else's
          presence in the room.
          She turns to face the intruder... MARISSA standing, waiting
          patiently.

                         KATRIN
          You look different in pictures.

                         MARISSA
          Well here I am in the flesh.
          KATRIN'S mouth twitches with all the imagined conversations
          she's had with MARISSA.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          Has Erik Heller contacted you?

                         KATRIN
          Erik's dead.
          MARISSA sits calmly in an old arm chair.

                         MARISSA
          Huh, if only.

                         KATRIN
          If he's alive why would he contact
          me?

                         MARISSA
          That depends on whether you believe
          he's innocent, or not.

                         KATRIN
          I'm an old woman with a broken

                         HEART -

                         MARISSA
          - What's in the past, stays in the
          past, right?

                         KATRIN
          Something like that.

                         MARISSA
          So why all the years of snooping
          around and sticking your nose in?

                         KATRIN
          You'd understand if you had kids.
          She turns her back on MARISSA.

                         MARISSA
          Kid's, they fuck you up, don't
          they?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.
          MARISSA stands up, puts a 9mm to the back KATRIN'S head and
          pulls the trigger.
          KATRIN drops to the floor revealing a framed, blood
          splattered, photograph of KATRIN ZADEK'S daughter - JOANNA.

          131 INT. TENT. SPANISH CAMPSITE. EARLY DAWN. 131

          HANNA and SOPHIE lie next to each other in sleeping bags with
          a torch between them.

                         SOPHIE
          Can't you sleep?

                         HANNA
          No.

                         SOPHIE
          Me neither.
          SOPHIE pauses. Looks at her.

          SOPHIE (CONT'D)
          Hanna?

                         HANNA
          Yes?

                         SOPHIE
          Where do you really come from?

                         HANNA
          Leipzig, I live in Leipzig -
          SOPHIE looses her patience.

                         SOPHIE
          If we're going to be friends you
          have to be honest with me. Them's
          the rules.
          HANNA is taken aback.

                         HANNA
          Are we friends?

                         SOPHIE
          Yes. I like you.

                         HANNA
          I'd like to have a friend.

                         SOPHIE
          I mean you're a freak and
          everything, but I like you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

                         HANNA
          I like you too. I really do. But
          there are things I can't tell you.
          Do you understand?

                         SOPHIE
          Yes... Actually, no, I don't.

                         HANNA
          There are people that want to harm
          me. Bad people.

                         SOPHIE
          I see.

                         HANNA
          And they wont stop.

                         SOPHIE
          Right.

                         HANNA
          So for your own safety...
          HANNA looks into SOPHIE'S eyes.

          HANNA (CONT'D)
          Can we still be friends?

                         SOPHIE
          I don't know. I mean, I don't
          really know who you are. Do I?

                         HANNA
          That's just it. Neither do I.
          She reaches into her bag. Brings out the DNA report. Shows it
          to Sophie. They read. Interfering Sequence. Abnormal.

                         SOPHIE
          What is it?

                         HANNA
          I think it's about me. DNA is kind
          of how we're made I think. I mean
          who we are.
          They look at it.

                         SOPHIE
          What will you do?

                         HANNA
          I'm going to Berlin. I have to meet
          my father at the house of Wilhelm
          Grimm.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.

                         SOPHIE
          As in âGrimm's Fairytalesâ?

                         HANNA
          That's right.
          SOPHIE sighs at HANNA.

                         SOPHIE
          If you say so.

                         HANNA
          Did I say the wrong thing again?
          SOPHIE looks at HANNA, sees she's vulnerable. She takes a
          bracelet off her own wrist. Gives it to her.

                         SOPHIE
          Keep this. To remember me.
          HANNA takes it, puts it on. Moved. Looks at SOPHIE.

          SOPHIE (CONT'D)
          It's a friendship bracelet.

                         HANNA
          Thank you.
          HANNA stares at the ceiling, looks over at SOPHIE who's
          starting to sleep. HANNA reaches out and touches her hair.
          Beside them, separated by a thin piece of fabric, we see that
          MILES has woken and has been listening in the darkness.

          132 INT. KATRIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 132

          MARISSA is searching the apartment. She's thorough and fast.
          She rips cushions and throws books from their shelves. Her
          actions become progressively more frantic, relishing the
          destruction. She finds more and more photograph's of JOANNA.
          The photographs seem to have a driving effect on her.
          She walks down the hall and opens a door onto a small spare
          bedroom that had been turned into home office. Every
          available wall space is covered in newspaper clippings and
          photographs relating JOANNA'S murder.
          On the floor MARISSA finds a box of old casette tapes. She
          stops to inspect one of the tapes. A label reads: âJoanna no.

          24'.

          133 INT. DANISH HOSTEL - MORNING. 133

          ERIK HELLER walks into a small, long-established family hotel
          on a Danish road near the coast.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.
          He is in the slightly dated suit he wore when he left the
          forest and looks a little dishevelled and odd. A sixtyish
          Danish woman stands behind the counter, scrutinising him.
          They speak in Danish with English subtitles.

          ERIK (SIGHS, EXHAUSTED)
          I need a room.

                         RECEPTIONIST
          Yes of course.

                         ERIK
          I stayed here fifteen years ago. It
          hasn't changed.

                         RECEPTIONIST
          We don't much like change here.

                         ERIK
          Neither do I.

                         RECEPTIONIST
          Name?

                         ERIK
          Olsson. Peter Olsson.

                         RECEPTIONIST
          You have some post.
          She turns and retrieves HANNA'S POSTCARD from the mail rack
          and hands it to him.

                         ERIK
          Thank you.
          ERIK reads: âMission accomplishedâ

                         RECEPTIONIST
          Have you heard about the manhunt?
          A man has killed two coastguards.
          Everybody is being asked to keep an
          eye out.

                         ERIK
          For what exactly?

                         RECEPTIONIST
          I don't know.
          He smiles. She takes a closer look and notices goose fat
          smeared behind his ear.. and blood on a shirt cuff...

          134 INT. VAN/SPANISH CAMPSITE - MORNING 134

          The FAMILY have checked out and are leaving the campsite.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.

                         HANNA
          How long until you drop me off?

                         RACHEL
          We should have you there by dinner
          time. From Lille you can get a
          train to Berlin. Leipzig's just a
          few hours further.
          HANNA and SOPHIE exchange a look.

          135 EXT. RECEPTION. SPANISH CAMPSITE - CONTINUOUS 135

          The FAMILY van passes through the campsite gates to reveal
          ISAACS coming out of the reception hut.
          He sees the van, recognises it. He sees the kids in the back.
          Bingo. He runs to a black BMW where two of his HENCHMEN are
          waiting for him.

                         ISAACS
          Wake up. It's them.
          He jumps in the passenger seat whilst the driver revs the
          engine.
          The BMW pulls out in front of an oncoming truck narrowly
          avoiding a collision.

          136 INT. ISAACS' BMW - CONTINUOUS 136

          ISAACS holds onto the dash.

                         ISAACS
          Keep your distance.

          137 INT. DANISH HOSTEL - DAY 137

          The RECEPTIONIST picks up the phone and dials.

                         RECEPTIONIST
          Is that the police? Yes, I don't
          want to trouble you but I have a
          new guest you may wish to know
          about.

          138 EXT. VESTERBROGADE STATION/COPENHAGEN. DAY. 138

          A commuter train pulls into the vast station. Amongst the
          morning commuters alighting the train is ERIK HELLER. He
          looks furtively around, and tries to blend in with the crowd.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.
          POV - from a walkway above the station - someone is watching
          HELLER as he tries to conceal himself within the throng. A
          DANISH AGENT, hidden on a metal walkway above the platform.
          On the platform HELLER walks amongst the commuters, past the
          ticket collectors, past another DANISH AGENT posing as a
          commuter - he stops and lingers by him, noting something not
          right.
          He moves off and enters a small bar.
          The second AGENT immediately follows and from the walkway,
          the other rushes downstairs to give chase too.
          HELLER walks through the bar into the toilets, finds a FIRE
          EXIT and walks out through it.

          139 EXT. GOODS YARD/VESTERBROGADE STATION - DAY 139

          HELLER finds himself in a goods yard adjoining the train
          station. He walks through the goods yard, then suddenly, and
          apparently for no reason, stops dead, then throws himself
          behind a skip of empty bottles.
          As he does two new men, AMERICAN SPECIAL OPS, run round the
          corner into the goods yard.
          From the fire exit, the DANISH AGENTS EMERGE and after
          signalling to each other, head off to the perimeter.
          The various agents scour the yard. The SPECIAL OPS get closer
          to HELLER's hiding place. HELLER suddenly emerges from his
          hiding place and sticks an elbow in the face of one, a knee
          in the groin of another.
          There's a brief exchange of blows.
          One of the SPECIAL OPS draws his hand gun.
          HELLER produces a knife out of nowhere and launches at the
          man, cutting him on the hand, making him drop his gun.
          He stabs the other in the eye and the man falls to the ground
          squealing.
          HELLER leans in and takes from the man's pocket his

          CELLPHONE.
          HELLER makes a run for it. One of the SPECIAL OPS lets off a
          shot, the bullet clipping HELLER in the leg.
          He falters but limps off behind the towering containers.

          140 EXT. FRENCH ROAD - DAY 140

          The FAMILY van is making its way up through France.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.
          Following in the black BMW, a few cars behind, ISAACS and his
          HENCHMEN are biding their time.

          141 INT. VAN/FRENCH ROAD - EVENING 141

          RACHEL is driving, while HANNA rides in the front seat
          keeping her entertained.

                         HANNA
          ...they can live at freezing
          temperatures for up to nine months
          without food. Imagine that, nine
          months.

                         RACHEL
          Why do you know so much about
          fleas?

                         HANNA
          I read it in my Encyclopaedia.
          HANNA is looking in the side view mirror. She sees ISAACS BMW
          and frowns, she's seen it before.

          HANNA (CONT'D)
          Also, they can jump around 200
          times their own body length, which
          makes them the best jumpers of all
          known animals except for the
          froghopper. Now they can really
          jump.
          RACHEL makes a turn and HANNA checks the side view mirror
          again. Yes, the BMW is still there. HANNA becomes anxious.

                         RACHEL
          Everything all right?

                         HANNA
          I think so.
          But HANNA'S face betrays her concern.

          JOANNA (V.O.)
          Mama, I know you're disappointed in
          me, I know it. I'm so sorry, Mama.
          But I have found maybe a way to
          make it better...

          142 INT. HOTEL SUITE. COPENHAGEN - NIGHT 142

          CLOSE ON - a portable casette machine playing one of the
          tapes MARISSA discovered at KATRIN ZADEK'S.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

          JOANNA (V.O.)
          I'm in a program now... a program
          to make babies stronger.
          In an adjoining bathroom MARISSA, in a pair of cotton
          pyjamas, is brushing her teeth. Her lips pulled back in a
          snarl.

          JOANNA (V.O.)
          An American program. It's very
          scientific. Important scientific
          work.
          Still brushing MARISSA walks through to the tape machine and
          presses fast forward. Then play -

          JOANNA (V.O.)
          Erik says he can get these tapes to

                         YOU -

                         MARISSA

                         (MUTTERS)
          Bastard.

          JOANNA (V.O.)
          - He says I look beautiful. I don't
          feel beautiful...
          MARISSA doesn't care, fast forwards. Play -

          JOHANNA (V.O.)
          ...I'm not sure if it's true that
          the baby can hear, but at night I
          sing. I hope it hears me.
          MARISSA listens, for some unknown reason to MARISSA this
          catches her imagination.
          The phone rings.

                         MARISSA
          What?

                         RECEPTIONIST
          Frau Wiegler, this is reception. I
          have one Erik Heller for you.
          MARISSA stops dead.

                         MARISSA
          Put him on.

          ERIK (O.S.)
          You were supposed to be dead.

                         MARISSA
          So were you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.

          143 EXT. PARK. COPENHAGEN - NIGHT 143

          A phone booth in a city park. ERIK shivering in the cold as
          icy rain falls around him, he's holding the CELLPHONE he
          stole from the dead SPECIAL OPS. HELLER'S leg is bleeding
          profusely.

                         ERIK
          Well, here we are.

                         MARISSA
          How did you know I was here?

                         ERIK
          I killed one of your men. Got his
          cellphone. You've gotten soft.

          MARISSA (O.S.)
          No, I just grew up. The world's
          changed since you died.

                         ERIK
          You got kids?

          144 INT. HOTEL SUITE. COPENHAGEN - CONTINUOUS 144

          MARISSA stops, taken aback by the question.

                         MARISSA
          No, I made choices.

                         ERIK
          Hanna's practically yours, you
          know?
          This goes straight to an ache that's been building in

          MARISSA.

                         MARISSA
          Not interested.
          But she is.

                         ERIK
          She's true and good and funny.
          Yeah, she's funny. She's special.
          You should see her.

                         MARISSA
          I'm looking forward to it.

                         ERIK
          You'll have to catch her first.
          The line goes dead. MARISSA puts the phone down and sits
          quietly for a moment. Then presses play again on the tape
          machine.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.

          JOANNA (V.O.)
          Was it like this for you, Mama? I
          think I know what the baby looks
          like. I think it's a girl -- I hope
          so.

          145 EXT. INDUSTRIAL ROAD - NIGHT 145

          The FAMILY'S van drives - behind ISAACS BMW tails it, lights
          on high beam.

          JOANNA (V.O.)
          I wonder who she'll be? I hope
          she's smart. I hope she's a
          stronger person than I am.

          146 INT. VAN - NIGHT 146

          HANNA sits beside her in the passenger seat, her anxiety
          growing.
          RACHEL is still at the wheel, watching the bright headlights
          behind.

                         RACHEL
          Shit. Shit, shit, shit. I think
          we're lost, Hanna.
          HANNA checks the side view mirror again and sees ISAACS BMW.
          She's knows that whoever is driving that car is after her.
          She looks back and sees SEB, SOPHIE and MILES all comfortably
          asleep. MILES' fingers wrapped around a Transformers toy.

          RACHEL (CONT'D)
          I'm going to pull over.

                         HANNA
          No, don't.

                         RACHEL
          I need to check the map.

          147 EXT/INT. CAR/CONTAINER PARK - NIGHT 147

          The van slowly pulls in at the side of the road.
          RACHEL waits for the BMW behind to pass but instead it pulls
          in behind the van.
          On either side of the road is an enormous container park. The
          containers are piled on top of each other like a giant baby's
          building blocks.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.

                         RACHEL
          Why won't that car pass? He has his
          lights on high beam, I was doing
          everything I could to get out of
          the way...
          SOPHIE wakes up in the back.

                         SOPHIE
          Are we stopped? I need to pee.

                         RACHEL
          Well, I don't want you going too
          far right now.

                         HANNA
          I think you should stay where you
          are, Sophie.
          HANNA doesn't take her eyes off the mirror. She can see the
          silhouettes of ISAACS and his MEN. They don't move and
          neither does HANNA. Both are waiting for the other to make
          the first move.

                         RACHEL
          Hanna, what's going on. Seb wake
          up.

                         HANNA
          Please.

                         SOPHIE
          This is creepy. You're creeping me
          out.

                         SEB

                         (GROGGY)
          Are we in Lille?

                         HANNA
          I'm sorry. But you really mustn't
          get out of the van.
          HANNA climbs into the back of the van and comes very close to

          SOPHIE.

          HANNA (CONT'D)
          What ever you do, don't follow me.
          Promise not to follow me.

                         SOPHIE
          I promise.

                         RACHEL
          Hanna, tell me what's going on or
          Seb will go over to that car and
          find out.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.

                         SEB
          Like fuck I will. Everyone stay
          put. Where's my phone?

                         HANNA

                         (TO SOPHIE)
          Thank you for being my friend.
          HANNA looks back at the BMW. All at once all four of the car
          doors open.
          In a flash, HANNA pulls open the van's side door and bolts
          from the van.

                         RACHEL
          Hanna!
          RACHEL sees ISAACS and one of the HENCHMEN chase after HANNA.
          The SECOND HENCHMAN appears at her drivers window aiming his
          gun at her head. RACHEL screams.

          148 EXT. CONTAINER PARK - NIGHT 148

          HANNA sprints across hard tarmac heading for the relative
          safety of the container park.
          ISAACS and his HENCHMAN follow at speed.
          HANNA enters a dark gully between two enormous containers.
          ISAACS slips around the other side to block her off. He
          signals to the HENCHMAN to loop around and flank HANNA.
          HANNA moves quietly between the containers, turning this way
          and that.
          ISAACS voice comes echoing through the maze.

          ISAACS (O.S.)
          Don't be a silly girl, Hanna. You
          need to come with me now. I know
          where your papa is.
          She listens.

                         CUT TO:
          ISAACS, his gun in hand, calls out again.

          ISAACS (CONT'D)
          He wants to talk to you, Hanna. He
          misses you.

                         CUT TO:
          The HENCHMAN appears directly behind HANNA. HANNA double-
          kicks him in the chest.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.
          HANNA pulls herself up the side of the containers and
          scrambles on top of them and runs, jumping between the
          containers when she reaches a gap.
          The HENCHMAN appears having climbed up too.
          A chase ensues. HANNA, followed by the HENCHMAN climbing up
          higher, now four containers high.
          ISAACS follow below.
          HANNA jumps an enormous gap between two containers and right
          over the head of ISAACS.
          HANNA slips and tumbles but catches the edge of one of the
          containers on her way down. She hangs there a moment, then
          pushes herself off the side of the container and manages to
          land on a lower container on the other side.
          HANNA running across the tops of the containers sees the
          HENCHMAN appear at the far edge. She grabs a discarded wrench
          and throws it at the man, catching him in the side of the
          head - a perfect aim - and he tumbles to the ground.
          She descends the containers with nimble leaps and comes to
          the ground.
          She's running now through a maze of tight alleys between the
          containers. She stops at a âT' junction, unsure which way to
          go. Suddenly ISAACS appears at the end of one alley, HENCHMAN
          ONE at the end of another, and HENCHMAN TWO at the end of the
          third.
          She's trapped.

          ISAACS (CONT'D)
          Just take it easy.
          HANNA makes her decision and runs straight at ISAACS.
          He stretches out his arms in an attempt to catch her.
          She hits him like a bowling ball hitting the last pin and he
          crashes to the ground.
          She rolls and springs to her feet.
          The HENCHMEN follow but HANNA is too quick.

          149 EXT. SCRAP METAL YARD/CANAL - NIGHT 149

          HANNA sprints full tilt out of the container park and through
          a scrap metal yard. Either side of her rise mountains of
          waste.
          HANNA reaches the edge of an industrial canal from where the
          scrap metal is unloaded.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.
          A large industrial barge is passing beneath. HANNA jumps and
          lands on the moving barge. Then quickly takes cover under a
          tarpaulin.

          150 INT. HOLDING CELLS. DAWN 150

          Four holding cells in a row, each one holding a member of the
          family.
          SEB paces around his cell. RACHEL sits stoically in hers.
          SOPHIE is crying in her cell while MILES is playing with his
          Nintendo in his cell.
          MARISSA walks into SOPHIE'S cell.

                         MARISSA
          Would you please stop crying?

                         SOPHIE
          I'm not telling you anything.

                         MARISSA
          Honey, your friend is in a lot of
          danger. You need to help us find
          her.

                         SOPHIE
          I don't know where to find her!
          MARISSA grits her teeth, shows SOPHIE a photo of FELICIANO.

                         MARISSA
          Do you know him?

                         SOPHIE
          No.

                         MARISSA
          He knows you.

                         CUT TO:
          MARISSA now in RACHEL'S cell.

                         RACHEL
          We gave her a ride because we
          thought she was in trouble.

                         MARISSA
          But you knew she didn't have a
          passport. You smuggled her into
          port and helped her illegally gain

                         ENTRY -

                         RACHEL
          She said she lived in Leipzig. She
          went to the Klaus Kohle Gymnasium.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.

                         MARISSA
          There is no Klaus Kohle Gymnasium.
          It closed five years ago.
          Shock on Rachel's face.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          Did she give any idea of where she
          was going?
          Rachel wracks her brains.

                         RACHEL
          She said she was going home, to
          Leipzig. She seemed lost. Like she
          needed taking care of.
          (woman to woman)
          You understand.
          MARISSA shows her the photograph of JOANNA ZADEK.

                         MARISSA
          This was Hanna's mother, Joanna
          Zadek. Fifteen years ago Hanna's
          father shot her to death on a
          camping holiday by the Baltic.
          RACHEL swallows, goes pale.

          MARISSA now in SEB'S cell.

                         SEB
          She was odd. I'll give you that.
          Disconnected. I mean I get on with
          most kids, you know, have a
          rapport. But, this one -

                         MARISSA
          You know, Mr Lyall, it's days like
          these that I really hate my job.

                         SEB
          I'm sure you do.

                         MARISSA
          It's a very, very difficult thing
          to do.

                         SEB
          Absolutely.

                         MARISSA
          But sometimes children are bad
          people too.

          81.
          MARISSA in MILES'S cell. MILES is terrified of MARISSA. She
          puts her hand out and strokes his hair.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          I'm not going to hurt you.
          MILES shrinks from her touch.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          Miles is a nice name. Are you a
          nice boy?
          She strokes MILES' hair and immediately he starts crying
          loudly.
          SEB pounds on the wall from his cell.

                         SEB
          Hey what's going on in there? We
          don't have to put up with this!
          We're in the EU, Goddammit!

          151 EXT. BARGE. RURAL FRANCE INTO GERMANY. DAWN 151

          HANNA watches as the sun rises over the misty fields either
          side be the canal. It's a beautiful sight. HANNA is strangely
          peaceful.

          152 INT. HOLDING CELLS. DAWN 152

          Now the whole family are reunited in MILES' cell. He sniffs
          and plays with his Nintendo. The others look wan as MARISSA
          passes around a photo of the two dead DANISH POLICEMEN. The
          family go silent.

                         MARISSA
          Three days ago Hanna's father
          killed two Danish policemen on a
          beach with a hunting knife.

                         SEB
          Where is he now?

                         MARISSA
          He's still at large and he's still
          very dangerous. We need to find
          Hanna before he does.
          Pause. SOPHIE thinks about it but clams up. Marissa notices.

                         MARISSA (CONT'D)
          If you know anything at all, it's
          vital you tell us for her own
          safety. We are now very worried
          about her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.
          But SOPHIE doesn't say a word.

                         RACHEL
          Sophie?
          Still nothing. They all look at her. MILES suddenly speaks.

                         MILES
          She's going to Berlin. To Wilhelm
          Grimm's house.

          SOPHIE (TO MILES)
          You little bastard!

                         RACHEL
          How did you know that?

                         SOPHIE
          You fuckwad!
          SOPHIE slaps MILES over the back of the head but SEB pushes
          her back.

                         SEB
          Hey hey hey! Sophie for God's sake.

          153 EXT. BERLIN CANALS - DAY 153

          HANNA'S sits on the prow of the barge as it makes it's slow
          progress into Berlin.

          154 INT/EXT. CAR/STREET - DAY 154

          MARISSA looks out at a school playground as she waits in the
          back of her car.
          The passenger door next to her opens and ISAACS gets in.

                         ISAACS
          I've looked through Heller's
          contacts from the 1980's. There's
          no one called Wilhelm.

                         MARISSA
          Wilhelm Grimm wrote fairy-tales. He
          died two hundred years ago.
          MARISSA hands ISAACS a brown envelope containing one of the
          photographs she took from KATRIN'S apartment.
          The photograph shows a happy looking JOANNA and ERIK at a
          busy family amusement park. Between ERIK and JOANNA is a
          clown, his arms around both of them. This we will come to
          understand is KLAUS KNEPFLER. Behind them is a GRIMM'S

          BROTHERS HOUSE OF FUN.

                         ISAACS
          What the hell is this?
          MARISSA smiles slightly.

                         MARISSA
          Wilhelm's house.
          (to the DRIVER)
          Drive on.

          155 EXT. BERLIN STREETS - DAY 155

          HANNA wanders through the skyscrapers and glass constructions
          of Berlin.
          People swarm around her but pay her no mind.

          156 INT. TRAM - DAY 156

          HANNA is riding a tram to the outskirts of town.

          157 EXT. ABANDONNED AMUSEMENT PARK - DAY 157

          HANNA walks beside a wire mesh fence that separates her from
          an abandoned amusement park. Behind her is an enormous steel
          works from which great industrial plumes of steam rise.
          HANNA climbs under the fence and walks through this surreal
          playground long since reclaimed by nature. There are huge
          fibreglass dinosaurs toppled over with heads missing and
          abandoned dinosaur legs. Rising above the park, surrounded by
          a muddy moat, is the big wheel now standing at a vertiginous
          angle. In front of the big wheel is the WILHELM GRIMM HOUSE.
          The house is a Grimm Brothers fairytale theme âFun House'.
          It's windows long since shuttered, vines growing through its
          roof.
          HANNA stands in front of the house in deep anticipation. She
          walks up the small steps that lead to the front door and
          knocks. She waits, heart sinking at the thought of there
          being no-one home. Then, ever so slightly the door opens and
          peering out at her is a man with the sad face of an out of
          work clown.

                         KNEPFLER
          Excuse me young lady?
          It is the man from the photo, but twenty years older. Small,
          with a wiry intensity.

                         HANNA
          Are you Wilhelm Grimm?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.

                         KNEPFLER
          Not exactly, but it'll do for now.
          Come this way.
          He leads her inside.

          158 INT. WILHELM GRIMM'S HOUSE - DAY 158

          They come inside - it's old and full of hoarded junk,
          antiques, boxes, books, dusty china, lamps, figurines, but
          still functional - an old man's home. He stops to look at
          her.

                         KNEPFLER
          So you are Hanna.
          He puts out his hand to shake.

          KNEPFLER (CONT'D)
          It's very nice to meet you, Hanna.
          HANNA smiles and shakes his hand, she likes him already.
          KNEPFLER studies her, quietly moved by his memories.

          KNEPFLER (CONT'D)
          My real name is Knepfler. Herr
          Knepfler. I'm an old friend of your
          father's. I am a sort of
          âcaretakerâ here.

                         HANNA
          What happened to it?

                         KNEPFLER
          No car park. You need a car park
          these days, otherwise people wont
          come. But somebody has to watch
          over it...

                         HANNA
          It's beautiful.

                         KNEPFLER
          I like it too. Erik used to come
          here a great deal.

                         HANNA
          Have you heard from him?
          He nods.

                         KNEPFLER
          You must wait. He will be here
          soon.
          HANNA stares, not quite believing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.
          HANNA stares out the window, thinking all this through.
          KNEPFLER leads HANNA through a reception area and under a
          spider with a human face that straddles a door to a run down
          kitchen.

          159 INT. KITCHEN. WILHELM GRIMM'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 159

          HANNA follows KNEPFLER into the kitchen.

                         KNEPFLER
          Please, sit down.
          HANNA sits at the old kitchen table on a wooden bench, while
          KNEPFLER goes to the stove.

          KNEPFLER (CONT'D)
          Would you like an egg? They're
          fresh.

                         HANNA
          Please.
          HANNA takes an egg, breaks it and swallows it raw.
          KNEPFLER smiles. He gives her a buff envelope. She looks
          inside - some money, a passport, ID cards.

                         KNEPFLER
          You'll need a fresh photograph.
          Don't get it wet.
          HANNA looks at the passport with a new name - ANNA-MARIE
          ELKAN. She takes a deep breath, not really comprehending.

                         HANNA
          I don't really understand.

                         KNEPFLER
          ID. Identity. It tells people who
          you are.
          She stares at the passport with the blank space for her
          photo.

          KNEPFLER (CONT'D)
          There is an apartment ready for you
          in the south. Erik will come and
          the car will take you there today.
          You will live there now.

                         HANNA
          Do I have to?

                         KNEPFLER
          Don't you want to?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.

                         HANNA
          I don't know. I miss the forest. I
          miss my home.

                         KNEPFLER
          That's to be expected. But the city
          is so exciting, don't you think?

                         HANNA
          I suppose.
          She drinks her water, thinking.

          HANNA (CONT'D)
          Did you know my mother?

                         KNEPFLER
          I did.

                         HANNA
          What was she like?

                         KNEPFLER
          She was very gentle, she was very
          funny, very talented - a singer -
          did you know that?

                         HANNA
          Yes...

                         KNEPFLER
          She had your eyes.
          He smiles at her.
          She here's a noise outside and runs to look out the window.
          She sees ISAACS BMW pull up outside the house followed by a
          second car.

                         HANNA
          It's him.

                         KNEPFLER
          Quick.
          KNEPFLER leads HANNA out of the kitchen.

          160 EXT. WILHELM GRIMM'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 160

          The driver of the second car gets out and opens the back door
          for MARISSA. She gets out and looks up at the house.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.

          161 INT. RECEPTION. WILHELM GRIMM'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 161

          KNEPFLER points HANNA towards a set of stairs that lead up
          from the reception.

                         KNEPFLER
          Upstairs.
          There's a knock at the door.
          HANNA begins to climb the stairs while KNEPFLER approaches
          the front door.
          There's another knock at the door.

          162 INT. GRANDMA'S ROOM. WILHELM GRIMM'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 162

          HANNA enters a room that's been designed to look like
          Grandma's bedroom from Little Red Riding Hood.
          HANNA hurriedly slides under the bed. Breathing as quietly as
          she can.
          She can hear the sound of ISAAC'S MEN starting to spread
          through the house.

          KNEPFLER (O.O.V)
          Listen to me, listen. There is no
          one here. There is nobody up
          there...

          MARISSA (O.C.)
          Check the attic.
          Footsteps to the attic.

          163 INT. WILHELM GRIMM'S HOUSE/STARS - DAY 163

          MARISSA has KNEPFLER cornered on the stairs.

                         MARISSA
          Erik Heller? Do you know him?

                         KNEPFLER
          I have never heard of him.

                         MARISSA
          Really?
          MARISSA shows him the photograph of JOANNA, ERIK and KNEPFLER
          outside the house.

                         KNEPFLER
          I don't know these people.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.

                         MARISSA
          Think very carefully
          He shrugs and MARISSA grabs KNEPFLER by the throat. He speaks
          in gasps.

                         KNEPFLER
          He called me. She's coming soon. To
          meet him.

                         MARISSA
          When?

                         KNEPFLER
          Tomorrow! Tomorrow morning.
          MARISSA lets him go. She turns to ISAACS.

                         MARISSA
          Take him in there. Find out what he
          knows.

          164 INT. GRANDMA'S ROOM. WILHELM GRIMM'S HOUSE - DAY 164

          The sound of KNEPFLER being escorted into a next-door room,
          the door shutting. The sound of footsteps coming into the
          room. HANNA silent under the bed. MARISSA'S GREEN SHOES are
          in sight, nothing else.
          The green shoes come close and HANNA feels the mattress
          compress as MARISSA sits on the bed. She looks at the shoes
          as she hears her call.

                         MARISSA
          Lewis. It's Marissa.
          HANNA hears the name. The name of the woman she thought she
          had killed. Her face pale in shock and fear.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          You got anything? He's coming here.
          I can smell it. Double the men.
          But, Lewis, I want to talk to him.
          HANNA hears MARISSA hang. Another pair of shoes enter the
          room. Male. ISAACS.

                         ISAACS
          His name's Klaus Knepfler. He used
          to send Heller's things from Berlin
          before the Communists were kicked
          out of Prague.

                         MARISSA
          How much does he know about the
          programme?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

                         ISAACS
          Everything. He knew Johanna.

                         MARISSA
          What does he know about the child?

                         ISAACS
          He also thinks Erik's the father.

                         MARISSA
          Well that's good.

                         ISAACS
          Everybody thinks Erik's her father.
          Erik probably thinks he's her
          father.
          They snigger. HANNA's eyes widen in shock. She can barely
          control her breath.

                         MARISSA
          Crazy bastard. You got a fix on him
          yet?

                         ISAACS
          Let's see what else Knepfler has to
          offer.
          He leaves her. MARISSA suddenly senses something. Did she
          hear an intake of breath? She turns and quickly looks under
          the bed. No one there. Her imagination maybe.
          MARISSA stands and we see the shoes walk away to the door.
          They reach the door. HANNA, clinging to the bedsprings in mid-
          air, not breathing. The green shoes leave. HANNA breathes.
          Hurriedly she climbs out from under the bed and goes to a
          window.

          165 EXT. WILHELM GRIMM'S HOUSE - DAY 165

          HANNA lands having jumped from the window.
          She looks around quickly. Then, out of sight from the cars at
          the front of the house, she runs for dear life.

          166 EXT. BERLIN STREET - DAY 166

          HANNA walking fast, in total shock and confusion. Who is she?
          She walks head down, determined not to be seen. Not knowing
          where she is going. Her world turned upside down. She sees an
          internet cafe. Ducks into it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

          167 INT. INTERNET CAFE. BERLIN - DAY 167

          HANNA sits down at a computer. The young OWNER comes up to
          her.

                         OWNER
          Excuse me. You have to pay first.

                         HANNA
          How much?

                         OWNER
          3 Euros for half an hour.
          She looks at the money that Knepfler gave her. It contains
          Euros. She hands some over to the OWNER.

                         HANNA
          How does it work?

                         OWNER
          You've never used the internet?

                         HANNA
          No.
          He smiles in amazement and logs on for her. The owner brings
          up a search engine.

                         OWNER
          Just type whatever it is you're
          looking for here.
          He walks away and HANNA slowly starts to type. She types in

          DNA INTERFERING SEQUENCE.

          168 EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK/WILHELM GRIMM'S HOUSE - DAY 168

          ERIK HELLER limps, head bowed, through the Amusement Park.
          He suddenly stops dead and ducks behind a fallen fibreglass
          dinosaur as he sees two CIA AGENTS sitting in a car outside
          the house.
          HELLER watches for a moment or two.
          Then, keeping low, he makes a painful run towards the house.
          HELLER throws himself against the back wall of the kitchen.
          He breathes heavily for a moment, clutching his wounded leg.
          He turns and rises to look through the kitchen window.
          Inside he sees KNEPFLER, stripped to the waist his body
          bloodied, hanging upside down from a meat hook. He's
          obviously dead.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.
          HELLER crouches back down against the wall, thinking
          furiously. Then, decision made, he checks sight lines and
          runs back across the Amusement Park away from the house.

          169 INT. INTERNET CAFE. BERLIN - DAY 169

          HANNA sits at the computer, looking at the screen breathless
          with tension.
          Phrases from the text leap out at her. âAn interfering
          sequence within the DNAâ , âintervention to the mother's
          uterus during pregnancy.â
          HANNA stands in shock. She reads again. âIntervention to the
          mother's uterusâ
          HANNA deletes the page. Sits in shock. Then writes in her
          mother's name. JOHANNA ZADEK.
          Immediately the article about JOHANNA's death comes up. HANNA
          stares at it. She reads it. No mention of a child. There is
          an address for Johanna Zadek. She came from the Heizinger
          Buildings area in the suburbs of East Berlin. HANNA writes it
          down. Gets up and leaves.

          170 INT. TAXI. EAST BERLIN SUBURB - DAY 170

          HANNA sits in the back of a taxi as it takes her into a grim
          concrete jungle of old East German housing projects.
          HANNA looks at the thousands of tiny windows, so many lives
          being lived in unawareness. Is this normality? Is this the
          world she longed to be a part of?

          171 INT. GRANDMA'S ROOM. WILHELM'S HOUSE. BERLIN - DAY 171

           MARISSA and ISAACS wait in Grandma's Room. ISAAC's phone
          rings.

                          ISAACS
          Isaacs.
          He listens. Puts the phone down.

          ISAACS (CONT'D)
          A public computer at a Berlin
          internet cafe just did a web search
          for âDNA Interfering Sequenceâ.

                         MARISSA
          Hanna?

                         ISAACS
          Next they searched the name Johanna
          Zadek.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.
          MARISSA stops dead. Looks at ISAACS.

                         MARISSA
          She's not coming here.

          172 EXT. KATRIN ZADEK'S APARTMENT BLOCK. EAST BERLIN HOUSING 172


          PROJECTS - DAY
          HANNA gets out of the taxi and looks up at an enormous grey
          housing block - the Heizinger building.
          She approaches the entrance and looks on all the buzzers.
          Sees a name scrawled on one - Number 14. Zadek.
          She presses the buzzer. Waits. No answer.
          A GANG OF KURDISH YOUTHS come out the block and HANNA catches
          the door and enters.

          173 INT. HALL. KATRIN ZADEK'S APARTMENT BLOCK - DAY 173

          HANNA knocks at the door of number 14, waits, knocks again,
          louder. No reply.
          A door further along opens. Kurdish music pours out. A
          KURDISH WOMAN wrapped in shawls emerges pushing a pram. She's
          followed by her two other CHILDREN.

                         HANNA
          (In German w/ English

                         SUBTITLES)
          Excuse me. I'm looking for Joanna
          Zadek's house. Can you help?
          The KURDISH WOMAN wont look HANNA in the eye as she passes.
          She mutters her response.

                         KURDISH WOMAN
          (In Kurdish w/ English

                         SUBTITLES)
          I don't speak German.
          HANNA kicks at the door but knows it won't be answered so
          doesn't wait.

          174 EXT/INT. KATRIN ZADEK'S APARTMENT. EAST BERLIN HOUSING 174


          PROJECT - DAY
          HANNA walks round to the back door of the apartment and
          approaches the kitchen window. She peers through.
          On first inspection the kitchen seems undisturbed. Then HANNA
          sees the framed photograph of JOANNA on the wall. Blood
          splattered across the glass.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.
          HANNA quickly moves to the door, tries to force it. She looks
          around, no-one's coming. With a sharp kick she smashes the
          glass.

          175 INT. KATRIN ZADEK'S APARTMENT - DAY 175

          HANNA climbs through the broken glass into the kitchen. The
          air is thick with the buzz of Bluebottle flies.
          HANNA sees the photograph of JOANNA. With some trepidation
          she moves round the kitchen table and sees the body of KATRIN
          ZADEK. The back of KATRIN'S head is blown clean away. The
          flies have laid their eggs in the bloody mess of her brain
          that spreads across the cheap lino floor.
          HANNA steps back and gags.
          She backs out of the kitchen and into the hall. Turns and
          goes through into the lounge.
          The lounge has been over thrown. Cushions ripped, shelving
          pulled down. HANNA stares at the destruction wrought by
          MARISSA'S hunt for information.
          HANNA turns, walks back down the hall and passes a door to a
          tiny second bedroom. She stops and enters.
          The room had been turned into a home office, there are
          newspaper clippings relating to JOANNA'S MURDER and
          photographs of JOANNA herself covering every available wall
          space. A testament to KATRIN'S unremitting search for the
          truth behind her daughters murder.
          HANNA begins to search the room for clues. Anything that will
          help her understand who she is and where she came from.
          Then suddenly she hears a quiet familiar voice.

          ERIK (V.O.)
          You won't find anything.
          HANNA turns in shock.

                         ERIK
          Marissa would have been much too
          careful for that.
          HANNA stares at him. ERIK HELLER.

          ERIK (CONT'D)
          Sit down Hanna.

                         HANNA
          Are you my father?

                         ERIK
          Sit down.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

                         HANNA
          Are you my father?

                         ERIK
          Please.

                         HANNA
          Are you?
          Moment of electric silence between them. ERIK does nothing
          but she knows the answer is no.

                         ERIK
          I was going to tell you.
          HANNA sinks to the floor. Breathing fast.

                         HANNA
          What's wrong with me?
          ERIK flinches slightly.

                         ERIK
          Nothing.

                         HANNA
          Where was I born?
          ERIK knows he has to tell the truth.

                         ERIK
          At Galinka.

                         HANNA
          What's that?

                         ERIK
          It was a secret CIA research
          programme in rural Poland.

                         HANNA
          What kind of research?

                         ERIK
          Children.
          HANNA stares at ERIK.

          ERIK (CONT'D)
          It was run by Marissa Wiegler. The
          science came from the old East
          Germany. The money from the CIA.
          The intention was to explore
          whether small genetic changes could
          be made to embryos... to improve

                         THEM

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.

          HANNA CONT'D)
          Improve?
          ERIK looks at her. She looks so young, so numb, so lost.

                         ERIK
          Reduce capacity for fear. For pity.
          Increase muscle strength. Heighten
          senses. Anything that might make a
          better soldier.
          HANNA looks up, stares at him. It's her he's talking about.

                         HANNA
          How did you know about it?
          ERIK's stares right at her.

                         ERIK
          I worked for it.
          She stares at him. He hands her a piece of paper from his
          pocket.

          ERIK (CONT'D)
          This is what you were looking for.
          HANNA reads. It is an invitation to Johanna Zadek to
          participate in the Galinka project. A projected date of
          arrival at the Galinka Centre. A date - 23rd February 1995.
          An agreed fee to be paid to Johanna. Five hundred American
          dollars. An agreement to give up the child and have no legal
          claim over it. The letter is signed by Erik Heller.

          ERIK (CONT'D)
          I recruited your mother at an
          abortion clinic in May 1994. She
          was about to terminate an unwanted
          pregnancy. Some boy at a disco.
          HANNA looks at the paper in shock.

          ERIK (CONT'D)
          I had recruited twenty women. She
          was the last. She was different.
          Two years later I heard the
          programme was to be terminated. The
          research âdisposed ofâ.

                         HANNA
          Disposed of?

                         ERIK
          I tried to save all of you. But you
          were the only one I was able to
          rescue.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.
          HANNA stands in shock. She reaches to the window of the room
          to get some air. She is reeling - faint.

          ERIK (CONT'D)
          Hanna listen to me.

                         HANNA
          Keep away from me.
          ERIK approaches her. With real conviction.

                         ERIK
          It worked. You worked.

                         HANNA
          You mean I'm a killer?

                         ERIK
          No... no..
          He makes to touch her. HANNA springs back in violent
          repulsion.

                         HANNA
          Don't touch me.

                         ERIK
          We have a new identity for you. A
          new life. A new beginning.
          She stares at him, then pushes past him. ERIK stops, pushes
          her back but then HANNA grabs a sharp letter opener.

          ERIK (CONT'D)
          Don't.
          She attacks, ERIK pushes her to one side, grabs her. A fight
          in the apartment. Chaos, photos of Johanna crashing, lamps
          and bookshelves falling. HANNA murderous, ERIK just defending
          himself, not willing to hurt her. But then she overpowers
          him, has a knife to his throat.

                         HANNA
          Let me go.
          He releases her. She goes to the door.

                         ERIK
          I tried to prepare you for what
          your life would be.

                         HANNA
          You didn't prepare me for this.
          And her look is so full of pain that in that moment ERIK
          knows he has done a terrible wrong. She starts to leave down
          the fire escape. ERIK calls after her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.

                         ERIK
          Hanna wait.
          He looks out to watch her go. It's then ERIK sees the cars
          coming across the estate scrubland.
          ERIK turns in panic. And dashes back into the apartment, runs
          through the destroyed living room, and out through the front
          door.

                         176 176

                         DAY
          ERIK comes out of the main entrance and runs into full view
          of the cars, deliberately distracting them from HANNA.

          177 INT. MARISSA'S CAR. CONT. 177

          MARISSA's car is a about to turn the corner and bump straight
          into HANNA when suddenly...
          MARISSA sees ERIK leaving the front of the apartment block.
          She speaks to ISAACS.

                         MARISSA
          That's him.
          And the car swerves to follow him. Thus moving unknowingly
          away from the slight figure of HANNA. HANNA can see the cars
          in full chase of Erik Heller. He has distracted them.

          178 EXT. STREET. EAST BERLIN. 178

          HELLER sprints fast across the wasteland. Incredible
          athleticism. He dives down a side alley, losing his pursuers
          for a second. Takes out a gun, looking for Marissa. Looking
          to finish it off.
          Just as he has done this ISAACS' HENCHMAN approach from the
          end of the street. HELLER fires in their direction, starts to
          run down an alley. He vaults a dividing wall, scratching
          himself on barbed wire. He sprints round a corner and sees a
          doorway ahead of him. He walks towards the doorway.

          MARISSA (O.C.)
          Drop it.
          MARISSA steps out of the doorway, her gun trained on him.
          There are men at the end of the alleyway. No escape. HELLER
          drops his gun.
          Silence between them. He turns to look her in the eye.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.

                         ERIK
          So go ahead.
          She stares at him. Wants to make this as painful as she can
          for him.

                         MARISSA
          You know I'll find her.

                         ERIK
          Don't under estimate what you
          created.

                         MARISSA
          What we created, together.

          179 EXT. ESTATE BUILDINGS - CONTINUOUS 179

          HANNA is walking fast across the grim grey estate to a main
          road.

          180 EXT. STREET. EAST BERLIN - CONTINUOUS 180

          MARISSA with her gun still at ERIK.

                         MARISSA
          Truth is I was always very fond of
          you.

          181 EXT. ESTATE BUILDINGS - CONTINUOUS 181

          CLOSE ON - HANNA continuing to walk away.
          She hears a single gun shot. Stops dead. Knows what it means.
          An intense conflict of emotions inside her. Her breathing
          stops for a moment, her world seems to go silent.
          Then a car flies by on the main road, almost running her
          over, and she is woken. She sees a bus stop ahead. On auto-
          pilot she runs to it, a bus coming, she beckons. It stops and
          she is on board.

          182 EXT. WASTELAND. EAST BERLIN. 182

          MARISSA stands over the dead body of ERIK HELLER.

                         MARISSA
          Leave him here.
          And they all walk away leaving him alone in the East Berlin
          dirt.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.

          183 INT. BUS, EAST BERLIN. 183

          HANNA on the bus. Shaking from the shock of his death,
          bloodied slightly from the fight. The other passengers stare
          at her as she forces back the tears. HANNA reaches in her
          pocket for a handkerchief, but only pulls out the letter Erik
          showed her. The Galinka letter. She sees the address.
          Galinka, Ostrovska district, Poland.
          HANNA makes a decision. She is going back to where she was
          born. She must find out who she is.

          184 INT. ESTATE BUILDING. KATRIN ZADEK'S FLAT. 184

          MARISSA enters the apartment. And looks at the chaos. ISAACS
          comes up behind her. HENCHMEN at the door.

                         ISAACS
          They had a fight.

                         MARISSA
          She must know the truth.

                         ISAACS
          Where do you think she's gone?

                         MARISSA
          Where would you go?
          MARISSA turns to ISAACS.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          I'm closing the CIA operation down.
          Heller is dead, that's all that
          matters to them. This we do alone.

          185 INT. POLISH TRAIN. 185

          HANNA's head rests on the backrest of a train-seat as the
          train crawls through the Polish/German border. Exhausted,
          many nights without sleep. Hungry but unable to eat. Needing
          resolution.
          In the same carriage a Polish woman sleeps alongside her
          child of two, also sleeping. HANNA looks at the child. The
          peace of the innocent.

          186 EXT. POLISH TRAIN STATION. NIGHT. 186

          The train entering a Polish train station. The town is called
          Ostrovska. Freezing cold. The town is in the North of Poland
          and it's very poor. Industrial. Bleak. HANNA exits,
          approaches a station guard.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.

                         HANNA
          I am looking for a train to
          Galinka.

                         GUARD
          Galinka is a small village. No
          trains. You must wait for bus in
          the morning.

                         HANNA
          Where can I stay?
          He points. HANNA sees the hotel.

          187 INT. POLISH HOTEL. BEDROOM. NIGHT. 187

          HANNA enters the tiny, dank hotel room. She looks at the
          filthy carpet, the grey ceiling. She turns on the tiny TV.
          Cartoons. Tom and Jerry type stuff. But she doesn't laugh.
          She flicks channel. Then stands dead still. She is looking at
          ERIK HELLER's dead body on the ground. The report depicts him
          as a dangerous criminal. HANNA stares at the image. The death
          of the man she spent her life with. Lost forever. HANNA's
          face oddly still in the TV flicker. Then she flicks it off.
          Leaves the room.

          188 INT. POLISH HOTEL. FOYER/BAR - NIGHT. 188

          HANNA, exhausted, sleepless and starving, comes down the
          shabby hotel stairs and enters the hotel bar. Grim. Empty
          room, old carpet, bad smell, dated pop music. Three hard-
          drinking men stare at her, making her uncomfortable as she
          goes to the bar. A forty-five year old BUSINESSMAN stands
          there, drinking.

                         HANNA
          Do you have a sandwich?

                         BARMAN
          Kitchen is closed.
          The BUSINESSMAN speaks in German.

                         BUSINESSMAN
          Get her something. Poor girl's
          hungry.
          The barman disappears. HANNA looks round, waits.

          BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)
          I'm from Leipzig.
          HANNA flinches at the name. Leipzig.

          BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)
          You?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.

                         HANNA
          The same.

                         BUSINESSMAN
          Business?
          He looks at her body. HANNA senses it. Her sandwich arrives.
          It's grim. She leaves it, walks out.

                         BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)
          Where are you going?

                         HANNA
          I am tired. I need to sleep.
          She leaves the bar. HANNA walks back up the stairs.
          BUSINESSMAN follows.

                         BUSINESSMAN
          Hello?
          She walks along the corridor, gets to her room. BUSINESSMAN
          follows.

                         BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)
          I was just making nice
          conversation. Yes?
          As she enters her room, he puts his foot in the door.

                         BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)
          Let's talk. Maybe we can do
          business.
          HANNA kicks his foot out of the door. Hard.

                         BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)
          You don't like talk, huh?
          He barges into the room and grabs her. Tries to push her on
          to the bed. He is strong. His words and tone contrasting
          violently with his actions.

                         BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)
          Be nice. Be a nice little dolly.
          HANNA is thrust on to the bed, but suddenly turns him over
          her head and smashes him against a cupboard. BUSINESSMAN
          grabs her hair and throws her on the bed.
          But now HANNA snaps. She starts to roar. It's like an animal,
          like nothing we have seen before. She rips at his face, grabs
          a glass, smashes it and cuts his face with it. Pure animal
          rage. BUSINESSMAN starts to scream, blood pouring from his
          eyes. He collapses on the floor. She kicks him, punches him,
          repeatedly in a grief-fuelled rage until she is spent of her
          primal fury and falls, panting, to the floor.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.
          When she looks up she sees his mangled bloody body lying next
          to her. Not quite dead.
          HANNA suddenly recoils in horror. Shocked by the viciousness
          of her actions.
          Tears begins to run down her cheeks as HANNA grabs the man's
          wallet, and leaves the room.

          189 EXT. POLISH STREET - NIGHT 189

          Shaking in shock, HANNAH walks out of the hotel and down the
          street, in a daze, no idea where she is going. She starts to
          run, faster and faster, just running to run out of herself.
          Finally she stops and is sick. She looks up. A taxi's yellow
          light blinks in the darkness. She looks at the businessman's
          wallet to see how much money is in there. She approaches the
          taxi.

                         HANNA
          I have this much. Can you take me
          to Galinka?

          190 EXT. POLISH HILL ROAD - NIGHT 190

          HANNA is in the taxi as it travels a lonely Polish forest
          road through undulating snow-covered hills. Cold dawn is
          arriving. Grey skies lightening through the windscreen. Tall
          snowy pines tower above the car. No one else on the road,
          just a horse drawn cart guiding cows to pasture. It is as if
          from a different age. Quiet, solitary. HANNA checks the
          paper in her pocket. Still there. Blood on her hands from the
          businessman. A cut in her arm. Carefully, secretly, she wipes
          it clean.
          Suddenly the taxi stops.

                         DRIVER
          This is as far as the money gets
          you.
          HANNA looks out. Middle of nowhere.

                         HANNA
          How much further?

                         DRIVER
          Twelve miles.

                         HANNA
          Please.
          But no smile from him, nothing. HANNA gets out. Starts to
          walk as the taxi turns and drives back the way it came.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.
          She is alone in the forest, freezing, shattered, hungry. Just
          about dawn. Cold as hell.
          She hears a car approach. Tries to hail it but it flies past
          fast. Blows icy air in her face.
          She continues in the freezing cold - sees the road ahead.
          It's hilly, winding, she isn't going to make it. Too tired.
          Too shattered.
          Time passes. Still she walks. Dead on her feet. Gathering
          every ounce of energy.
          Then the sounds of another car. But it too just flies by,
          ignoring her waves and cries.
          HANNA almost collapses in frustration. But carries on.
          Carries on walking.
          Time passes. Freezing cold. HANNA alone on the road. Can she
          make it?
          Then another car. HANNA turns, waves, cries out. And, almost
          magically, the car slows and stops. The window winds down.

          HANNA (CONT'D)
          I'm going to Galinka. Can you help
          me?
          A woman's voice, German, in German.

          WOMAN (V.O.)
          Yes I can take you there.
          And as HANNA gets in, she looks at the comforting, smiling
          face of MARISSA WIEGLER.

          191 INT. CAR. POLAND. ROAD TO GALINKA - NIGHT 191

          MARISSA starts to drive, HANNA sits in the front with her.
          HANNA has no idea who she is.
          MARISSA speaks in perfect German. Calm, soft, comforting.

                         MARISSA
          It's a very dull place Galinka. Why
          would you want to go there?

                         HANNA
          I was born there. But I've never
          really seen it. Why are you going?

                         MARISSA
          I have some business to sort out.
          She looks at her and smiles a sunny, uncomplicated smile.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          It's very lucky we ran into each
          other, don't you think?

                         HANNA
          Yes...

                         MARISSA
          You've hurt your arm.

                         HANNA
          It's okay.
          MARISSA hands her some tissue. HANNA bandages the arm.

                         MARISSA
          I'm Astrid.

                         HANNA
          You're not German. Are you
          American?

                         MARISSA
          That's right. I lived there for
          many years. I travel a lot.
          MARISSA smiles at her kindly. HANNA feels safe for the first
          time in ages. She feels the tears come.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          Oh dear, what's wrong with you?

                         HANNA
          Sorry.

                         MARISSA
          It's okay. Are you in trouble?
          HANNA nods. She fights the tears.
          MARISSA gently holds her hand as she drives. HANNA weeping.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          What sort of trouble?

                         HANNA
          (though her tears)
          I don't know what to do. Nothing is
          what I thought it would be. It's...
          ugly and cruel and I don't know
          where to go, or... I'm stupid. I
          don't know what I expected...
          MARISSA secretly, genuinely affected by this. Fights the
          emotion that has surprised her. Human warmth.

                         MARISSA
          Sometimes I feel the same way.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.
          HANNA eyes her, surprised to hear this from a grown up woman.
          MARISSA puts on some music. Gentle. Bach maybe.

                         HANNA
          I like music.

                         MARISSA
          Sleep why don't you? You look very
          tired. It will take half an hour on
          this road.
          HANNA nods. She begins to drift off, so long since she has
          slept. Her eyes fall shut and her head rests against the
          window. She is asleep. Vulnerable.

          192 EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAWN 192

          Soft dawn light as MARISSA drives on a narrow rural road.

          193 INT. CAR - DAWN 193

          MARISSA looks at the sleeping HANNA. MARISSA represses her
          gathering emotion. HANNA suddenly looking so young as she
          sleeps the sleep of the innocent. The rush of emotion shocks
          her - she is watching HANNA, not the road - and she veers
          off, nearly crashing the car, narrowly avoiding a tree. She
          puts her foot sharply on the brake. She's wearing the same
          GREEN SHOES as she wore at Wilhelm's House.
          HANNA is jolted awake.

                         HANNA
          Where are we?
          MARISSA calms herself instantly.

                         MARISSA
          Nearly there.
          HANNA doesn't see MARISSA'S SHOES.

          194 EXT. GALINKA 194

          MARISSA's car slows as it enters a tiny deserted hamlet.

          MARISSA (V.O.)
          This is it.

          195 INT. MARISSA'S CAR. 195

          HANNA looks around. There is not much to Galinka. She is
          confused.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.

                         HANNA
          It's so small.

                         MARISSA
          Yes. Just a few cottages. And the
          old bunker.
          HANNA chooses not to ask any more questions.

                         HANNA
          Thank you for the ride. You're very
          kind.

                         MARISSA
          I wish there was more I could do
          for you.
          MARISSA looks kindly at HANNA who is confused by the
          intimacy. MARISSA reaches into the glove compartment and
          retrieves a torch which she hands to HANNA.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          Here, take this.
          HANNA switches the torch on and off, thinking.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          I hope you find what you're looking
          for.

                         HANNA
          Thank you.
          She gets out and shuts the door behind her.

          196 EXT. GALINKA. CONT. 196

          HANNA looks around at the grey desolation, rural poverty, the
          ends of the earth. In the car MARISSA stares at her, then
          drives off.
          HANNA walks through the trees along a track. Overgrown, not
          used for many years.
          She reaches a hidden entrance off the track. By the entrance
          there is an old battered sign. GALINKA. HANNA looks at the
          old iron gate. Rusted, locked. It has not been opened in a
          long time.
          She stares at the sign, tries the gate - yes, locked. Then
          she climbs the gate. She nearly tears her clothes on the
          spikes at the top of the gate, then leaps over and,
          exhausted, four days without real sleep, begins to walk up
          the narrow tree-lined driveway.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.

          197 EXT. GALINKA BUNKER - CONTINUOUS 197

          HANNA approaches the gaping mouth of an underground bunker.
          She stops, looks down at the torch in her hand, switches it
          on and walks into the darkness.

          198 INT. TUNNELS. GALINKA - CONTINUOUS 198

          With only the torch light to see by HANNA treads warily
          deeper into the tunnels as, behind her, the small aperture of
          daylight recedes slowly to nothing.
          The tunnels seem to stretch on for miles ahead of her.
          HANNA reaches a junction where four tunnels meet. She shines
          her torch down each tunnel, trying to decide which way to go.
          She stops when she sees, a little way down one of the
          tunnels, a child's forgotten shoe.
          HANNA steps forward and shines her torch down at the tiny red
          shoe, its buckle rusted.
          She walks on into the dark.
          HANNA finds a door which she pushes at. The door is stiff,
          but HANNA uses her full weight and soon she's made enough of
          a gap to squeeze through.

          199 INT. NURSERY. GALINKA - CONTINUOUS 199

          At first HANNA has difficulty making out where she is, but
          dotted here and there are parts of an old nursery. The walls
          are painted with a blue sky, clouds and the figures of
          children holding hands.
          She begins to remember as, from a distant place, she hears
          the sound of children laughing. She shines her torch in the
          direction of the laughter and catches a glimpse of a child,
          dressed in a party frock and hat, playing hide and seek. She
          shines her torch the other way, and there's another, then a
          third and a fourth. For a moment the room seems to be filled
          with laughing children.
          Then, in an instant, they're gone again and silence returns.
          HANNA, lit only be the reflected light of her torch, knows
          she has been here before.
          She walks on through the tunnels.

          200 INT. DORMITORY. GALINKA - CONTINUOUS 200

          HANNA enters a long hall which was once the children's
          dormitory.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.
          At one end is a steep pile of metal bed frames.
          From a distant place in her memory HANNA begins to hear the
          sound of children singing.

                         CHILDREN
          Happy Birthday to you,
          Happy Birthday to you...
          From the far end of the dormitory come a procession of
          CHILDREN, the first of whom is carrying a large birthday cake
          lit with birthday candles. The children's faces glow eerily
          in the candle light. They're looking at HANNA and walking
          straight towards her as they sing.

          CHILDREN (CONT'D)
          Happy Biirrrrthday, dear...
          The CHILDREN arrive at HANNA lifting the cake towards her.

          CHILDREN (CONT'D)
          ... Hanna.
          Happy Birthday to you!
          HANNA leans forward, takes a deep breath and blows. The
          children disappear with the flames of the candles.
          The sound of a woman's approaching footsteps echo through the
          tunnel.
          HANNA swings her torch beam in the direction of the
          footsteps. She freezes as she sees a pair of GREEN SHOES
          walking towards her. The same shoes as in Wilhelm's house.

          MARISSA WIEGLER.
          HANNA raises her torch beam to see the face of the woman from
          the car.

                         HANNA
          You're Marissa Wiegler.
          HANNA starts to shake.
          MARISSA has her gun pointing at HANNA but her expression is
          the same sunny, uncomplicated smile as earlier. Dead silence.
          HANNA breathing fast. MARISSA speaks in English.

                         MARISSA
          Don't worry sweetie. I don't want
          to hurt you.
          MARISSA'S tone has turned into a twisted interpretation of
          maternal care.
          HANNA does not move. Like a wild animal cornered.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          109.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          I could have killed you already
          when you were asleep in the car.
          HANNA'S still shaking.
          HANNA now sees ISAACS and his HENCHMEN, three of them, all
          with hunting rifles. All ready to shoot her should she attack
          or run. They are some distance away, not coming any closer.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          Did Erik tell you about this place?

                         HANNA
          Where are the other children?
          She looks at MARISSA, who waits, then answers quietly.

                         MARISSA
          Sleeping. They're all sleeping.

                         HANNA
          I don't believe you.

                         MARISSA
          I can protect you, Hanna. Make sure
          you walk out of here and keep
          walking. Grow up and grow old in
          safety and security. No one need
          know a thing. But you have to trust
          me. You can't talk about this with
          anyone. It's what we call
          âclassified.â If you tell anyone,
          it'll be dangerous for both of us.
          HANNA looks at her, remembering what ERIK told her, trying
          hard not to succumb.

                         HANNA
          You killed my mother.

                         MARISSA
          You're mother didn't want you,
          sweetie. I saved you.
          HANNA just stares, not believing her.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          I'm the only person left who
          understands who you are. The only
          one who cares.
          MARISSA holds out a hand to HANNA, for HANNA to take, a
          motherly gesture...

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          I practically am your mother.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          110.
          HANNA'S stomach turns in horror. She switches off her torch
          and runs into the shadows.
          ISAACS raises his gun fires.

          201 INT. TUNNELS. GALINKA - CONTINUOUS 201

          HANNA running through the darkness. Behind her ISAACS and the
          HENCHMEN come after her. ISAACS carries a large heavy torch,
          as does one of the HENCHMEN. The other HENCHMEN all have
          night vision on their rifles.
          HANNA crouches down, she sniffs the air, can smell them
          coming.
          A HENCHMAN treads carefully down the tunnel. We see his point
          of view through his night vision sight, just the dark tunnel
          stretching on.
          Like a ghost HANNA'S face appears up close, her eyes a pearly
          white.
          She slams the gun back in the HENCHMAN'S face.
          Still in night vision we see the fight, quick and hard. The
          flash of a single bullet illuminates his death.
          Silence once more.
          HANNA now has the first HENCHMAN'S rifle.
          From around the corner into the next tunnel she hears the
          sound of feet on dirt. She presses herself against the
          tunnel, waits listening, hears the feet again and in one
          movement raises the rifle and spins round the corner.
          Through her night vision sight she sees a deer, scared eyes
          staring back at her.
          She releases her grip on the trigger and the deer scampers
          into the darkness.

          202 INT. LABORATORY. GALINKA - CONTINUOUS 202

          HANNA comes into the old laboratory. Through her night vision
          sights we see the white tiles and smashed equipment.
          She senses someone coming after her and ducks behind a lab
          bench.
          A HENCHMAN enters the lab carrying a hand gun and a small
          torch. His footsteps make a crunching sound as he steps
          through the broken glass that litters the floor.
          HANNA rises from her hiding place and stands straight into
          the torch light.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          111.
          She fires but is off target and only catches the HENCHMAN'S
          left arm.
          He drops his torch which slides across the floor.
          HANNA comes round the lab bench to where the HENCHMAN should
          be lying but he's gone. There's a trail of blood which she
          follows to a metal cabinet.
          She stops at the cabinet and fires three shots into its
          flimsy doors.
          The dead HENCHMAN slides out from the cabinet.
          HANNA takes the dead man's hand gun and goes to retrieve the
          torch.
          She switches the torch off.

          203 INT. TUNNELS. GALINKA. 203

          ISAACS, unnerved, presses himself against the wall of the
          tunnel. He feels something at his legs. Points his torch to
          find the deer pulling at his trouser leg. He shoots it. Then
          runs further down into the tunnel.
          Alerted by the sound of ISAACS' shot HANNA starts to pursue
          her prey.

          204 INT. DORMITORY. GALINKA. 204

          ISAACS is back in the dormitory. With torch in hand he
          searches under the beds. Behind him he hears HANNA enter. He
          switches off his torch and crawls under a bed.
          HANNA walks slowly between the beds. Under the bed ISAACS is
          preparing to fire, now watching her feet.
          Suddenly the bed he's under is lifted straight up in the air
          and off him - HANNA has summoned enormous strength and is
          clutching the end of the bed. He fires, hits nothing and she
          lets go - the bed comes crashing down on him again.
          His torch rolls away. His arms are trapped under the bed,
          he's unable to move.
          With all his might ISAACS pushes at the bed and lifts it off
          himself.
          They fight.
          HANNA picks up the torch and slams the torch across his
          temple. She grabs him by the hair and smashes his head
          repeatedly into the floor - BAM - BAM - BAM - BAM - BAM.
          Silence - he's dead.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          112.
          HANNA sits back on the bed and looks at her bloodied hands -
          looks down at what she's done. Shocked by her own violence
          she begins to cry hot tears of bewilderment.
          She gets up and runs from the dormitory.

          205 INT/EXT. TUNNELS/TUNNEL MOUTH. GALINKA - CONTINUOUS 205

          HANNA runs back through the tunnels.

                         HANNA
          No more. No more.
          Tears are streaming down her face as she reaches sight of the
          tunnel mouth and the daylight beyond. Standing in silhouette
          is MARISSA. HANNA slows her pace and stops when she can see
          the white of MARISSA'S eyes and the finger on MARISSA'S
          trigger.
          MARISSA raises the gun and aims at HANNA - but HANNA comes
          forward again, walking calmly towards her.
          She stops and drops her gun to the ground.

          HANNA (CONT'D)
          Everything I see is nothing I want.
          MARISSA looks at HANNA, her gentle, childlike countenance.
          She smiles.

                         MARISSA
          Let me take care of you?

                         HANNA
          No. I don't want that.
          HANNA turns her back on MARISSA and starts to walks in the
          opposite direction.
          MARISSA watches her walk away.
          HANNA walks waiting for the shot to come.

                         MARISSA
          Hanna.
          HANNA spins, fires directly at CAMERA.

          CUT TO BLACK.

          206 EXT. FOREST. NORTH SWEDEN. 206


                         FADE UP:
          The sun spreads its golden fingers through the trees catching
          the early morning dew.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          113.
          A wide shot of the HANNA'S cabin, wisps of smoke rise from
          it's chimney.
          HANNA steps out of the cabin. She's back wearing her furs
          again. In her hands she carries a cup of hot milk and a small
          wooden bowl.
          In VOICE-OVER we hear HANNA reading from her beloved
          Encyclopaedia.

          HANNA (V.O.)
          The Earth is the third planet from
          the Sun, and the fifth-largest of
          the eight planets in the Solar
          System.
          HANNA sits down on a tree trunk outside the cabin and pours
          some milk into the bowl, then drinks a little for herself.

          HANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Home to millions of species,
          including humans, Earth is the only
          place in the universe where life is
          known to exist.
          She raises her head and makes a small clicking sound. Her
          friend, the snow fox, appears from the trees. The fox now has
          a small family of cubs.
          HANNA watches as the cubs approach the milk and begin to
          drink.

          HANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          The planet formed over four and a
          half billion years ago, and life
          appeared on its surface within a
          billion years.
          HANNA sits back and feels the sunlight on her face. Above her
          the trees are beginning to leaf.

          HANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          It is expected to continue
          supporting life for another one and
          a half billion years, after which
          the rising luminosity of the Sun
          will eliminate it all.
          HANNA surveys her beautiful world.

               FADE IN

               RAIN

               Falls from low grey clouds. Down below we see...

               THE RIVER

               Muddy, slow and powerful, overflowing its banks. In the near 
               distance is...

               THE RESERVOIR

               Filled to the maximum, water thundering out of two open gates. 
               We close in on...

               THE DAM

               There's a Dam Control Office in the middle of the dam. We 
               MOVE OFF the reservoir and head out over...

               THE TOWN OF HUNTINGBURG

               We see "NO FEAR" spelled out in stones on one man's roof. We 
               go down and into...

               EXT. STREETS OF HUNTINGBURG - DUSK

               Storefronts are sandbagged and closed. A sign on one store 
               reads: GONE FISHING. A sign on another: HEY LOOTER. NOTHING 
               OF VALUE HERE. TRY NEXT DOOR. And on the next store: HE'S 
               LYING.

               A CHURCH

               Beautiful, old, ringed with a five-foot-high wall of sandbags. 
               The floodwater is up to the first level of sandbags.

               CARS AND PICKUP TRUCKS

               Loaded down, are heading out of town on streets covered in 
               the first water of the flood.

               A STATUE

               On an island in the middle of the street. It's Civil War-
               era, of a general on a horse, sword held high. The floodwater 
               is over the curb, lapping at the base of statue's pedestal. 
               Near the statue stands...

               THE SHERIFF

               50s, with soft edges and friendly eyes. He's talking into 
               his radio mike.

                                     SHERIFF
                         So, are we all going to die?

               EXT. RESERVOIR DAM

               HANK, the dam control officer, is on the radio with the 
               Sheriff.

                                     HANK
                         Not right now. But I'm gonna have to 
                         let out a little more.

               EXT. MAIN STREET

               WAYNE and PHIL, two deputies, 30s, are near the Sheriff, 
               shoring up a sandbag wall that has partially collapsed.

                                     PHIL
                         I think my best was when I turned 
                         twelve. My Dad set up a treasure 
                         hunt. It was really cool.
                              (off Wayne's disdainful 
                              look)
                         Well, it was.

               Wayne shrugs a "whatever" and pulls a sandbag up out of the 
               water. There's unpleasant-looking muck all over his arms. He 
               drops the sandbag back into the water and shakes off the 
               crud with disgust.

                                     WAYNE
                         This blows.

                                     PHIL
                         My most awful birthday was sweet 
                         sixteen. I had mono. How about you? 
                         What was your worst?

                                     WAYNE
                         You kidding? You think I could've 
                         possibly had a birthday worse than 
                         this? What kind of loser do you think 
                         I am?

                                     SHERIFF (O.S.)
                         Don't answer that, Phil.

               The Sheriff walks over.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Hank says he's gonna open another 
                         gate. We're gonna get another rise.

               They turn at the sound of honking. The MAYOR drives up.

                                     MAYOR
                         Gentlemen. Hey -- happy birthday, 
                         Wayne.

               Wayne nods. Phil stiffens. They do not like this guy.

                                     MAYOR
                              (to the Sheriff)
                         Mike, I gotta say, what you're 
                         doing... I don't know if I'd be here, 
                         considering.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (good-natured)
                         Well, you would be if you wanted to 
                         get the last couple of paychecks 
                         some bastard owed you.

                                     MAYOR
                              (grins, then:)
                         I just want you to know I think the 
                         people 'round here made a big mistake.

               Phil grumbles to himself.

                                     PHIL
                         "The people"? You're the one who 
                         screwed him.

                                     MAYOR
                         Sorry, Phil?

                                     PHIL
                              (blushes)
                         I, uh --

                                     SHERIFF
                              (to Mayor, saving 
                              Phil)
                         You know, Bob, as much as I'd love 
                         to stand here all day talking about 
                         how great I am, if you don't get 
                         moving I'm gonna have to haul your 
                         sorry ass off to jail.

                                     MAYOR
                              (laughs)
                         Okay, okay, I'm going. Keep up the 
                         good work, boys. It's appreciated.

               The Mayor rolls up his window and heads off.

                                     WAYNE
                         Whaddya say we go torch the fucker's 
                         house and blame it on looters. Or 
                         how about we put a dead cow in his 
                         living room. He comes back after 
                         it's been in the water a couple of 
                         days. Hello!

                                     SHERIFF
                              (shakes head)
                         You wanna know how to get the best 
                         revenge on the Mayor and his boys? 
                         You do exactly what we're doing. You 
                         protect the town. You protect it 
                         better than they would. Better than 
                         they ever could.

                                     WAYNE
                              (thinks, shrugs)
                         I think the dead cow's better.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (ignores Wayne)
                         Any looter that comes in here is in 
                         for a big surprise, cause as long as 
                         I'm still wearing this pointy thing...
                              (indicates badge)
                         ...nobody's taking anything from 
                         this town.

               INT. BANK VAULT

               Nervous assistant bank manager WELLMAN is hurriedly tossing 
               stacks of money into two canvas bags.

               A MAN'S SHADOW

               Washes up on Wellman.

                                     CHARLIE (O.S.)
                         Do you think you could go a little 
                         faster, pal?

                                     WELLMAN
                         I -- I'm going as fast as I can.

               SECOND SHADOW COMES UP

                                     TOM (O.S.)
                         Well, it's not fast enough.

               Wellman is about to speak, then sees something, gulps.

               A SHOTGUN

               Is held by one of the men, pointed at the floor.

               WELLMAN

               Sweeps the money off the shelves and into the bags.

                                     SECOND MAN (O.S.)
                         That it?

                                     WELLMAN
                         Yes. We don't keep any of our --

               THE TWO MEN

               Ignore Wellman, grab the canvas bags and stride off.

               EXT. BANK - DAY

               CLOSE ON the lower half of the front doors as they fly open. 
               Out come TWO MEN in long dark raincoats.

               WELLMAN

               Runs up, stopping in the open door.

                                     WELLMAN
                         Hey, wait!

               VERY CLOSE ON THE TWO MEN

               As they slowly turn to face Wellman. We just see their faces, 
               shielded from the rain by hat brims. Meet...

               TOM AND CHARLIE

               Tom, 30, handsome, with an easy smile. Charlie, 50, with a 
               tough, red face.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Excuse me?

               WELLMAN

               Looks nervous for a second, then holds up a clipboard.

                                     WELLMAN
                         You forgot to sign.

               TOM AND CHARLIE

               We see, for the first time, by their hats and uniforms, that 
               they are armored car drivers. There's an armored car parked 
               at the curb, on the other side of a low wall of sandbags.

               Charlie sighs, goes back to Wellman and perfunctorily signs 
               the form. Then he and Tom go to the sandbag wall. Tom holds 
               both bags in one hand and the shotgun in the other. Charlie 
               doesn't want to get wet.

               He steps from the sandbag wall onto the rear bumper of the 
               truck, then keys open the doors.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Okay.

               Charlie reaches out for the money bags. Tom jumps off the 
               sandbag wall and lands in the water, splashing Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                         For Christsakes!

                                     TOM
                         It's a flood, Charlie. You're gonna 
                         get wet.

               Charlie takes the bags, tosses them in then shuts the back. 
               He moves toward the front, still trying to keep out of the 
               water. Tom splashes him some more.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hey! Do you know what kind of crap 
                         is in that water?

                                     TOM
                              (of course he knows)
                         Well, yeah.

               Tom kicks some more water at Charlie. Charlie gives Tom a 
               withering look and climbs in the truck.

               INT. ARMORED TRUCK

               Charlie gets into the driver's seat; Tom climbs into the 
               shotgun seat. They shut and bolt the doors. Charlie gets on 
               the radio.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Dispatch, this is 31.

                                     DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                         Go ahead, 31.

                                     CHARLIE
                         We're leaving Huntingburg. We'll be 
                         back in an hour.

                                     DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                         Ten-four. Get out of there.

                                     CHARLIE
                         We're gone. Over and out.

               Charlie hangs up the radio. He starts writing on a clipboard. 
               Silence for a few moments, and then Charlie notices Tom 
               staring at him.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What?

                                     TOM
                         Your ear.

                         What about my ear?

                                     TOM
                         You've got a major hair growth going 
                         on.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Shut up.

                                     TOM
                         I'm serious. You're gonna need 
                         somebody to go in there with a weed 
                         whacker.

               Charlie grabs a donut bag off the seat and tosses it to Tom.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Here.

                                     TOM
                         You're offering me one of your donuts? 
                         I don't know what to say. I'm getting 
                         all misty.

                                     CHARLIE
                         If it'll shut your mouth you can 
                         have the whole bag.

               Charlie starts the truck. Tom thinks about it, then tosses 
               the bag back.

                                     TOM
                         Nah. I start eating donuts and I'll 
                         never get out of this truck.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (disgusted)
                         I love how you think you're better 
                         than this.

                                     TOM
                         Don't get me wrong, Charlie. There's 
                         a lot to like about this job -- and 
                         I don't just mean the dashing 
                         polyester ensemble and the solid 
                         three-figure income.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (angry)
                         You ungrateful shit! I don't believe 
                         you!

                                     TOM
                              (surprised)
                         Charlie, relax! I was kidding!

                                     CHARLIE
                         You don't wanna do this? Fine. Go 
                         back to selling hot construction 
                         machinery. That's a helluva career.

                                     TOM
                         It had better hours.

               Charlie slams the clipboard down on the seat.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You think this is a joke? This is 
                         funny? Jesus Christ! You know how 
                         lucky you are you could get in here? 
                         Thirty years old and all the crap 
                         you pulled and you never got caught?

                                     TOM
                              (angry)
                         That wasn't luck, old man. That was 
                         skill. I was good at it.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Oh, yeah, it takes a lot of skill to 
                         fence bulldozers. That's goddamn 
                         genius time.

                                     TOM
                         About as much skill as it takes to 
                         sit in a truck and get fat eating 
                         donuts.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Oh, so that's all I've been doing, 
                         huh? Just wasting my life away.

                                     TOM
                         I didn't say that.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Yeah, building a home, raising a 
                         family -- that's just stupid.

                                     TOM
                         I didn't say that!

                                     CHARLIE
                         You know what, Tom? I really don't 
                         give a shit what you said.

               Tom doesn't reply. Charlie puts the truck in gear; starts 
               off. Tom looks at Charlie, shakes his head -- what was that 
               about?

               JIM

               Late 50s, with a creased face and piercing eyes. He's sitting 
               at the bar, drinking coffee. Rain sheets down outside. The 
               BARTENDER watches TV, sound off. Next to Jim at the bar are...

               RAY, KENNY AND MR. MEHLOR

               Ray, 40s, has lank hair, rheumy eyes and a glass of Irish 
               whisky in front of him. Kenny, 20s, long hair, has the energy 
               of a puppy -- unfortunately he has about as much smarts as a 
               puppy. Mr. Mehlor. 40s, looks like -- and was -- a high school 
               teacher.

               ON TV

               Sound off, a MAN is crying about what he has lost in the 
               flood.

                                     RAY
                         "Thus saith the Lord; Behold, waters 
                         shall rise up out of the north and 
                         be an overflowing flood and all the 
                         inhabitants of the land shall howl." 
                         Jeremiah 47:2.

               Ray takes a drink. Kenny leans over to Ray, sotto.

                                     KENNY
                         You're gonna be able to buy a helluva 
                         lot of bibles, huh, Ray? Me? First 
                         thing I'm gonna do is get my brother 
                         a lawyer. Best that money can buy.

               A thought comes to Jim -- an answer to a clue in the crossword -- 
               and he starts filling in words as Ray and Kenny talk.

                                     RAY
                         What's he facing?

                         Thirty in.

                                     RAY
                         He cap a cop or something...?

                         Security guard. "In the commission..." 
                         All he's got is a piece of shit P.D.

                         a good lawyer -- a guy with a haircut.

               Jim leans over to Kenny.

               Jim slides the newspaper in front of Kenny.

                         Shit, Jim. I don't do crossword 
                         puzzles.

                                     MR. MEHLOR
                         I'll take a look, Jim.

                                     JIM
                         Kenny can read.
                              (to Kenny)
                         Just look at it. You know when you 
                         write down a word and suddenly it 
                         looks all wrong? Maybe it's right, 
                         but it doesn't look right?

               Jim points at the newspaper.

                                     CHARLIE
                         It's there.
                              (beat)
                         Somewhere. I hope.
                              (beat)
                         Look, Tom, I don't care what it is 
                         you end up doing.

                                     TOM
                         Oh, God, here we go again.

                                     CHARLIE
                         This is the last time, I swear.

               Tom sees something ahead. He doesn't understand at first.

               HIS POV

               The reflector bar on the pole two poles ahead is lower than 
               the others. No reflector bars for a hundred yards, then they 
               resume.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (looks at Tom)
                         I just think, whatever it is you do, 
                         it's time you did some heavy lifting.

               Tom figures out what's going on with the reflector bars.

                                     TOM
                         Stop!

                                     CHARLIE
                         No, you gotta hear this. You're better 
                         than --

                                     TOM
                         Stop the truck! We're going down!

               OUTSIDE THE TRUCK

               The water rises fast up the grille as the truck angles down.

               INSIDE THE TRUCK

                                     CHARLIE
                         Jesus!

               Charlie stands on the brakes.

               THEIR POV

               A wave of water rushes forward from the truck, then comes 
               back and washes over the hood, splashing up on the windshield.

                                     TOM
                         Back up!

               Charlie throws the truck into reverse but gives it too much 
               power. They hear the rear wheels spinning underwater. Charlie 
               eases off, the tires start to catch, they start moving 
               backwards.

               Charlie and Tom exchange a quick look of relief... and then 
               the engine dies. Charlie tries to restart it, but there's 
               nothing.

               OUTSIDE THE TRUCK

               It's stopped on a downgrade -- it's a dip in the road.

               The water is up to the top of the front tires: up to the 
               hubcaps on the rear wheels. The headlights are underwater, 
               spots of yellow glowing. They've stopped next to a lighted 
               sign.

               CLOSE ON SIGN

                                 WELCOME TO HUNTINGBURG.

                        HOME OF THE 1987 STATE CHAMPION WARRIORS.

               IN THE TRUCK

                                     CHARLIE
                         Goddammit!

                                     TOM
                         It's a little dip in the road or 
                         something. You can see the reflectors 
                         come up the other side.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (curses to himself)
                         I knew this would happen.
                              (grabs radio mike)

                                     TOM
                         I'll see if there's anyone coming. 
                         Maybe we can get pulled out.

               Tom opens the door. Charlie adjusts the radio frequency 
               selection button; clicks on.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Dispatch, this is 31. 31 calling 
                         dispatch.

                                     DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                              (over radio)
                         31, this is dispatch.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (into radio)
                         Dispatch, we're stuck outside of 
                         Huntingburg. Truck's dead.

                                     DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                         Where are you?

                                     CHARLIE
                         We're on 231, headed for the 
                         Interstate. Right by a sign saying 
                         "Welcome to Huntingburg."

               Tom climbs out and up on top of the truck.

               OUTSIDE THE TRUCK

               Tom stands on top of the truck. In one direction, nothing 
               but blackness. The other way he can see the lights of the 
               town. But there are no cars coming.

               IN THE TRUCK

               Charlie looks over as Tom appears, upside-down, in the 
               doorway.

                                     TOM
                         The town's been evacuated. We won't 
                         get any help from there.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Dispatch can't get anyone out.

                                     TOM
                         They are aware we're carrying a 
                         shitload of money...?

                                     CHARLIE
                         They called the National Guard. 
                         They're gonna be here in about ninety 
                         minutes.

                                     TOM
                         Ninety minutes? Jesus.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (nods; into radio)
                         Dispatch, we're gonna need help a 
                         little sooner than --

               There's a sudden sparking sound and the radio cuts out and 
               interior lights and the headlights go out.

                                     TOM
                         Oh, shit.

               INT. HOUSE - DUSK POV THROUGH WINDOW

               Looking out as the Sheriff's car rolls past on the water-
               covered street. A HAND lets go of a curtain and it swings 
               across the window.

               EXT. STREET - DUSK IN THE SHERIFF'S CAR

               The Sheriff motions Wayne to stop the car, then he grabs the 
               radio mike and clicks it on as a megaphone.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (into mike)
                         Henry, I saw you. Come on out.

               No one comes out of the house.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Henry, I'm not leaving until you 
                         come out.

               A few moments pass and then...

               HENRY AND DOREEN SWERZKY

               Late 70s, step out onto their porch.

                                     DOREEN
                         Jesus H. Christ, Henry, I told you 
                         to stay away from the damn window.

               THE SHERIFF

               Gets out of the car.

                                     SHERIFF
                         What are you still doing here?

                                     HENRY
                         We're just --

                                     DOREEN
                         We're setting traps.

                                     SHERIFF
                         That's illegal, Doreen.

                                     DOREEN
                         You gonna arrest us, Sheriff? Hell, 
                         are you even sheriff anymore, Sheriff? 
                         Didn't you lose an election? I sure 
                         as hell know I didn't vote for you, 
                         and neither did Henry.

                                     HENRY
                         Doreen...

                                     SHERIFF
                         You don't need to set traps.

                                     DOREEN
                         That's what they said in '73. When 
                         we got back, anything the bastards 
                         didn't steal they broke, just for 
                         the hell of it.

                                     SHERIFF
                         That's not happening this time.

                                     DOREEN
                         Damn right it's not.

                                     SHERIFF
                         You can't stay, you know that.

                                     HENRY
                         We're going to my sister's.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Good.

                                     DOREEN
                         Soon as we finish setting the traps.

               The Sheriff wants to say something more, but he's not about 
               to argue with Doreen. He just nods and gets back into the 
               car.

               IN THE CAR

               The Sheriff climbs back in. He and Wayne watch Henry and 
               Doreen go back into the house, Doreen still nagging at Henry.

                                     SHERIFF
                         God'll understand if you have to 
                         drown her in the basement, Henry.

               The Sheriff sighs, nods to Wayne. Wayne puts the car in gear.

               EXT. ARMORED TRUCK - NIGHT

               The water is creeping up the sloping hood of the truck.

                                     CHARLIE
                         We gotta get out of here.

                                     TOM
                         What about the money?

                                     CHARLIE
                         The money's safe; we're not. Water 
                         rose about a foot in the last twenty 
                         minutes. The National Guard isn't 
                         going to be here for another hour. 
                         You do the math.

               Tom shrugs -- Charlie's right. They're about to get out when 
               light washes up on them. They look out to see...

               THE HEADLIGHTS OF A GMC SUBURBAN

               Approaching on the other side of the dip, a quarter-mile 
               away.

               CHARLIE AND TOM

               Look at each other then get out of the truck.

               THE SUBURBAN

               Stops on the far side of the dip -- a hundred yards away. 
               The headlights shine across the water. Doors open and MEN 
               get out.

               TOM AND CHARLIE

               Come around the front of the truck. They can't see through 
               the glare of the Suburban's bright headlights.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hello!

                                     MAN'S VOICE
                         You okay? You stuck?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Yes!

                                     MAN'S VOICE
                         We'll see if we can get you out! 
                         We'll be right over!

               Charlie looks at Tom, relieved.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Looks like we might just --

               THE SUBURBAN

               Headlights go on high beam.

               CHARLIE AND TOM

               Squint, blinded by the high beams.

                                     TOM
                         Why'd they do that?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Probably so they can see better.

                                     TOM
                         Or so we can't see at all.

               Charlie looks at him -- what does he mean? Tom puts his hand 
               on his pistol.

               IN THE WATER

               Assembled by the Suburban are...

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               All holding guns. He speaks to them quietly.

                                     JIM
                         This is my retirement fund, boys, 
                         and if any one of you screws up, I 
                         swear to God I'll kill you. Let's 
                         go.

               They start wading down into the dip in the road. Kenny carries 
               a rifle.

               TOM AND CHARLIE

               Tom squints through the bright light.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Company dispatch and the National 
                         Guard are the only ones who know 
                         we're here.

                                     TOM
                         Anyone with a scanner from Radio

                         Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (realizes)
                         Jesus.

                                     TOM
                              (to Jim and men)
                         Could you turn down your lights?!

                                     JIM
                         We're bringing a rope!

                                     TOM
                         Turn down your lights!

                                     JIM
                         We'll be right there!

               Tom starts to pull his gun.

               KENNY

               is fired up on adrenalin. He has his rifle up and is aiming 
               it.

               HIS POV

               Tom with his hand on his pistol, starting to pull it out.

               TOM AND CHARLIE

               Charlie sees Tom going for his gun. He moves close to Tom, 
               half in front of him, putting his hand on Tom's.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Take it easy, Tom.

               KENNY

               Stiffens.

               KENNY'S FINGER

               Squeezes the trigger of his rifle.

               TOM

               Jumps at the sound of the rifle crack.

               CHARLIE

               Is knocked back.

               TOM

               Yanks out his gun and starts shooting back.

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               Duck down in the water.

               TOM

               Shooting blindly, looks over and sees...

               CHARLIE

               A horrible look on his face, blood coming out of his neck. 
               He sinks into the water.

               KENNY

               Shoots off another few quick rounds.

               TOM

               Drops into the water, bullets plugging in around him. Just 
               his hand and pistol are visible, shooting blindly back toward 
               Jim and his men. THE SUBURBAN

               Is hit by Tom's fire.

               TOM

               Runs out of bullets. A beat later we see Charlie start moving 
               through the water -- Tom is pulling him.

                                     JIM
                         STOP SHOOTING!

               KENNY

               Doesn't hear Jim and keeps firing.

               JIM

               Aims his pistol at Kenny's head.

                                     JIM
                         Stop.

               Kenny stops.

               BEHIND THE ARMORED TRUCK

               Tom comes up in the water behind the truck, gasping, holding 
               Charlie. Tom rests his gun on the truck bumper.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'm sorry, Tom.

               Charlie's gone.

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               Jim glares at Kenny, his eyes on fire.

                                     KENNY
                         He was going for his gun!

                                     JIM
                         He wasn't gonna shoot, Kenny. 
                         Goddamnit!
                              (shakes head, calls 
                              to Tom)
                         We just want the money! Get away and 
                         we won't have to kill you!

               TOM

               Shuts his eyes, thinking, scared.

                                     JIM (O.S.)
                         Now!

               Tom opens his eyes. He looks down at...

               CHARLIE

               Floating in the water.

               TOM

               What the hell is he going to do?

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               Jim's men look at him. Jim motions them to wait some more.

                                     JIM
                         You got thirty seconds to get the 
                         hell away!

               Jim and the others wait, but there's no answer from Tom.

                                     JIM
                         The clock's running! Go!

               Still no response from Tom.

               THEIR POV

               All they can see is the front of the truck, in the light of 
               the "Welcome" sign. They can't see the back.

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               Jim nods to his men. They head for the truck, down into the 
               deeper water at the bottom of the dip in the road. All have 
               guns up and ready.

               Jim sends Mr. Mehlor and Ray out to circle around. They all 
               move quietly. The only sound is the rain.

               JIM

               Gets to the truck and moves along its side, Kenny right behind 
               him. Jim gets to the back of the truck, nods for Kenny to 
               cover him, then steps out behind the truck, gun up.

               JIM'S POV

               Tom is gone.

               CHARLIE

               Is floating in the water, eyes of glass.

               KENNY, MR. MEHLOR AND RAY

               Step into the circle of light thrown by the "Welcome" sign.

                                     JIM
                              (eyes Charlie)
                         Ah, Jesus.
                              (to Kenny)
                         Your dad'd be real proud of you, 
                         Kenny.

                                     KENNY
                         He was going for his gun!

                                     JIM
                         Mr. Mehlor, I believe we're gonna 
                         need your science project.

               Mr. Mehlor nods and digs into his pack. Ray looks down at 
               Charlie in the water.

                                     RAY
                         "I shall bring floodwaters upon the 
                         earth to destroy all that lives under 
                         the heavens and every creature that 
                         has the breath of life in it shall 
                         perish." Genesis 6:17.

                                     KENNY
                         Were you a preacher or something?

               Ray laughs.

                                     MR. MEHLOR
                         Ray did five years in the hole at 
                         Joliet. The only thing you get to 
                         read in the hole is the Bible.

                                     KENNY
                              (to Ray)
                         You got religion?

                                     RAY
                         Obviously.

               Mr. Mehlor laughs as he pulls something out of his pack. 
               It's...

               SMALL EXPLOSIVE DEVICE

               A half-stick of dynamite with a timer, mounted on a magnet.

                                     MR. MEHLOR
                         When you hit the switch you've got 
                         thirty seconds.

                                     RAY
                         You teach your students how to make 
                         things like that?

               Mr. Mehlor puts the device on the back door.

                                     MR. MEHLOR
                         You been to a high school recently, 
                         Ray? My students taught me how to 
                         make things like that. Ready?

                                     JIM
                         Hold on.

               Something's wrong. Jim touches the handle on the door. It 
               moves. Uh-oh. He raises his pistol, grabs the door handle 
               and pulls. The door swings open. We don't need to see what 
               he sees -- we can tell from the expression on his face.

               EXT. ON THE ROAD

               Tom is running hard through the knee-deep water, pulling a 
               string of canvas money bags buckled together. The truck and 
               "Welcome" sign are two hundred yards behind him. Tom hears 
               an angry yell.

               EXT. BY THE ARMORED TRUCK

               Kenny is the one yelling.

                                     JIM
                         Shut up. Everyone.

               They quiet. The patter of the rain is too loud -- they can't 
               hear anything. Jim scans the horizon, but sees nothing.

                                     RAY
                         Now why'd he have to go and do a 
                         thing like that?

                                     JIM
                         To stay alive.
                              (off their looks)
                         He thinks we'll kill him -- unless 
                         he knows where the money is and we 
                         don't.

                                     MR. MEHLOR
                         There is another possibility.
                              (off their looks)
                         He's thinking of keeping it for 
                         himself.

                                     JIM
                         There's always that. Either way, we 
                         got ourselves a sharp one.

                                     KENNY
                         What do we do?

               Jim is looking at something in the distance.

                                     JIM
                         Pretty soon the water'll be too deep 
                         for him to run. But for us it'll be 
                         just deep enough.

                                     KENNY
                              (unclear)
                         Deep enough for what?

               INT. CAR AND BOAT DEALERSHIP - SHOWROOM

               A glass window is smashed and water floods into the boat 
               showroom. Jim and his men stride in. Kenny ogles a 
               particularly nice cruiser. Jim stops at a smallish ski-boat.

                                     JIM
                         Here we go.

                                     KENNY
                              (re: cruiser)
                         What about this monster?

                                     JIM
                              (re: ski-boat)
                         This is all we need.

                                     RAY
                         Shit, Jim, we're stealing. Can't we 
                         take anything we want?

                                     JIM
                         The water isn't very deep yet. We 
                         need something with a low draft. Mr. 
                         Mehlor -- find us some gasoline.

               Mr. Mehlor heads off.

               KENNY

               Sees something else he likes. We don't see what it is.

                                     KENNY
                         Oh, Jim...?

               EXT. CEMETERY

               The name WILLIAM PORTMAN is chiseled into a crypt. Tom appears 
               from underwater, gasping for breath. He gets to his feet and 
               trudges off through the water.

               EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE CEMETERY

               Tom comes out through the gates of the cemetery, splashing 
               through the knee-deep water. He's running when he hears, 
               from behind him, boat engines firing up. He turns to see...

               LIGHTS

               Racing toward him over the water, a hundred and fifty yards 
               back.

               TOM

               Sprints off.

               THE SKI-BOAT

               Jim is steering the ski-boat. Mr. Mellor hunkers down beside 
               him. We PULL BACK to see...

               TWO JET-SKIS

               Flanking the ski-boat, piloted by Kenny and Ray.

               ON THE ROAD

               Tom is running as fast as he can. He looks back, sees the 
               ski-boat and jet-skis closing. They'll get him before he 
               gets to town. He suddenly veers off the road toward...

               THE HIGH SCHOOL

               The sign out front reads: GO WARRIORS!

               EXT. HIGH SCHOOL

               Tom runs around the side of the high school.

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               Ride up on the ski-boat and jet-skis and round the corner.

               THEIR POV

               No sign of Tom.

                                     JIM
                         Cut your engines!

               The engines are shut down. They all drift. Jim shines a 
               flashlight over onto...

               WINDOWS

               There's a hole in a window large enough to climb through.

               INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CLASSROOM

               Tom wades through the classroom, pushing floating desks aside. 
               Flashlight beams stab into the room. Tom hurries to the hall.

               EXT. HIGH SCHOOL

               Jim turns to his men.

                                     JIM
                         Let's get him out. But for Godsake, 
                         whatever you do...
                              (with a hard look at 
                              Kenny)
                         ...don't kill him. Not until we find 
                         out where he hid that money.

               INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY

               Tom makes his way past banks of lockers, trying to get as 
               far as he can from the probing flashlight beams.

               EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - FRONT DOORS

               Kenny drifts up to the front doors. He pulls on them. Locked.

                                     JIM
                         Mr. Mehlor?

               MR. MEHLOR

               Reaches into his pack.

               INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY

               Tom tries lockers, looking for a place to hide.

               EXT. FRONT DOORS

               Kenny rides his jet-ski fast away from the front doors and 
               the doors explode.

               INT. SCHOOL FRONT LOBBY

               Tom ducks down as...

               A FIREBALL

               Shoots over him.

               KENNY AND RAY

               Ride the jet-skis into the flooded school.

               UNDERWATER

               Tom is swimming as hard as he can, out of breath. KENNY AND 
               RAY

               Ray goes off down a hall while Kenny idles in the lobby.

               TOM

               Surfaces, gasping.

               KENNY

               Hears the gasp, turns, grinning.

                                     KENNY
                         Enemy sub off the port bow!

               TOM

               Gets to his feet runs as fast as he can down the hall. He 
               rounds a corner and keeps going.

               KENNY

               Guns his engine and takes off after Tom.

               TOM

               Runs another thirty feet, then trips on something and goes 
               down.

               KENNY

               Comes around the corner, grinning when he sees...

               TOM

               Halfway down the hall, standing frozen, caught in Kenny's 
               light.

               KENNY

               Guns it, racing forward down the hall toward Tom.

                                     KENNY
                         Full steam ahead!

               THE JET-SKI

               Hits something underwater and stops.

               KENNY

               Keeps going. He flies through the air, slams headfirst into 
               a trophy case and drops into the water.

               TOM

               Stands up -- he was kneeling.

                                     TOM
                         Low tide, sailor.

               A HANDRAIL

               On the wall, angles down into the water. Underwater there 
               are a couple of steps leading up to a change in level in the 
               hall -- that's what the jet-ski grounded on.

               HALLWAY

               Ray motors down the hallway toward the corner.

                                     RAY
                         Kenny?

               HIS POV

               Around the corner comes a jet-ski. Ray assumes it's Kenny.

                                     RAY
                         See him?

               Then the jet-ski speeds up and shoots by him. Ray sees it's...

               TOM

               Wearing Kenny's hat and jacket.

               RAY

               Gives chase.

               SCHOOL HALLWAYS

               Ray races after Tom along the flooded hallways, taking the 
               turns fast. Ray pulls a gun, starts shooting.

               TOM'S POV

               Tearing through the halls, flashlight lighting the way. 
               Bullets hit the walls, ceiling, water around him.

               TOM

               Comes around a corner, sees the open front doors ahead of 
               him.

               JIM AND MR. MEHLOR

               Come into view in the ski-boat, blocking the exit.

               TOM

               Turns hard and speeds down a side hall.

               TOM'S POV

               A wall of windows at the end. No way out. Trapped. Then...

               KENNY

               Rises out of the water, blood running down his face, pistol 
               up.

               TOM

               Looks back.

               RAY

               Is on his tail.

               TOM

               Makes his choice and guns the jet-ski straight at Kenny.

                                     TOM
                         Yee-hah!

               KENNY

               Fires, misses and is knocked to the side as...

               TOM

               Hunches down on the jet-ski and crashes through the windows.

               EXT. HIGH SCHOOL

               Jim and Mr. Mehlor are moving right outside the windows just 
               as Tom blasts out of the school and races off into the dark.

               EXT. OPEN WATER

               Tom moves fast over the water. He yanks off his clip-on tie.

               JIM AND THE OTHERS

               Chase Tom's light, behind by fifty yards, heading out into 
               farm fields. They get closer and closer and then watch as...

               TOM'S JET-SKI

               Runs straight into a tree and explodes.

               JIM AND THE OTHERS

               Race up to find the burning, flaming wreckage of the jet-
               ski. Ray circles on the other jet-ski. Kenny, still bleeding 
               from the head, is in the boat with Jim and Mr. Mehlor.

                                     KENNY
                              (laughing)
                         Nice driving, buttwipe!

                                     RAY
                         I'm glad you're enjoying this, Kenny, 
                         but if he's dead, how do we find the 
                         money?

               Kenny reacts -- oh, right.

                                     JIM
                         Oh, he's still alive.

               We see what Jim sees.

               ECU THROTTLE OF JET-SKI

               Tom used his tie to wrap the throttle open.

               HUNDRED YARDS AWAY

               Tom is hiding in the branches of a floating tree, watching 
               the distant lights of Jim and his men. The current carries 
               Tom away.

               WITH JIM AND HIS MEN

               Jim scans the horizon; sees nothing.

                                     JIM
                         Ray, I'm in need of a little 
                         inspiration.

                                     RAY
                         "With a raging flood he makes an end 
                         of those who oppose him, and pursues 
                         his enemies into darkness." From one 
                         of the more obscure --

                                     KENNY
                         Sorry to interrupt Bible study and 
                         all, but has no one but me noticed 
                         how completely screwed we are? We 
                         should be back in the motel room, 
                         counting out the money. Instead --

               Jim lashes out with a fist, hard and fast, hitting Kenny in 
               the chest, knocking him out of the ski-boat, into the water. 
               Kenny comes up in the thigh-deep water, sputtering.

                                     JIM
                         No one likes this particular turn of 
                         events, Kenny, but we have a choice -- 
                         we can can either deal with it or we 
                         can walk away. There's a lot of money 
                         out there, so I choose to deal with 
                         it. If you want to go, that's fine -- 
                         start swimming. You want to stay, 
                         that's fine, too -- just stop your 
                         damn whining.

               Jim pushes the throttle forward and the ski-boat takes off, 
               leaving Ray on the jet-ski, with Kenny in the water.

                                     KENNY
                         What the hell's his problem? All the 
                         money in the world ain't worth a 
                         goddamn nickel if you get caught. 
                         It's not like there won't be other 
                         jobs.

                                     RAY
                         You may have more of these in you, 
                         Kenny, but Jim doesn't.

               Ray pulls Kenny up onto the jet-ski and takes off after Jim.

               EXT. BACK OF CHURCH - SANDBAG WALL

               The water level is creeping up a five-foot-high wall of 
               sandbags.

               REVERSE ANGLE

               Looking out over the top of the sandbag wall. A tree floats 
               by on the water.

               HANDS

               Suddenly appear on the top of the wall and...

               TOM

               Pulls himself into view. He climbs over the wall, exhausted.

               BEHIND THE SANDBAG WALL

               Gasoline-powered pumps are sucking up any rainwater. The 
               sandbags have kept the floodwater at bay.

               TOM

               He hurries up the back steps and goes into the church.

               INT. CHURCH - BACK ROOM

               Tom walks through a small room lined with closed cupboards. 
               He goes through a door.

               INT. CHURCH - MAIN HALL

               Tom comes out into the altar. He looks around, impressed. 
               It's a beautiful church. Scaffolding goes up one wall -- the 
               church is being restored. Tom is startled by a sound from 
               above. He grabs a heavy silver candlestick as a weapon and 
               looks up to see...

               BIRDS

               Fluttering up in the rafters.

               TOM

               Takes a breath. Just as he relaxes, he hears a whooshing 
               sound from behind him and turns to see...

               A LARGE CRUCIFIX

               Being swung at his head. Thunk and...

               THE SCREEN GOES BLACK

               FADE IN:

               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               Tom slowly regains consciousness, blinking his eyes. He 
               hears...

                                     SHERIFF (O.S.)
                         What are you doing here?

               But the Sheriff isn't asking Tom, he's asking...

               KAREN

               30, pretty, even in head-to-toe rain gear.

                                     KAREN
                         I was setting up pumps.

                                     WAYNE
                         I sure as hell don't get what you 
                         see in that church.

                                     KAREN
                         I wouldn't expect you to, Wayne.

                                     WAYNE
                         What's that supposed to mean?

                                     SHERIFF
                         Karen, did you think the order was 
                         for everyone but you to evacuate?

                                     KAREN
                         I was gonna go as soon as I filled 
                         the pumps, but the next thing I know, 
                         I've got a looter on my hands. Now, 
                         maybe I'm crazy, but I was expecting 
                         a little gratitude?

                                     PHIL
                         I think it's great what you did.

                                     WAYNE
                         That's it, Phil. That'll finally get 
                         you into her pants.

                                     PHIL
                         Shut up.

                                     SHERIFF
                         What if he'd had a gun, Karen? A lot 
                         of these looters carry guns.

                                     TOM (O.S.)
                         I'm not a looter.

               TOM

               Sits up on a cot, behind bars in the holding cell, woozy.

               INT. HIGH SCHOOL

               Jim and his men are searching the school for the money.

                                     RAY
                         Jim, it could be anywhere. It might 
                         not even be in the school.

                                     JIM
                         Keep looking.

               EXT. MAIN STREET

               The rain sheets down hard. A lightning flash reveals...

               THE STATUE

               The water is up to the horse's knees. The lightning passes 
               and a second later thunder rolls.

               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               The Sheriff, Phil, Wayne and Karen stand outside the cell. 
               Tom is inside, on the cot. He touches the cut on his forehead.

                                     WAYNE
                         What were you doing at the church?

                                     KAREN
                         I told you -- he was looting it.

                                     TOM
                         I just said I'm not a looter!
                              (to Karen)
                         You're the one who nailed me?
                              (Karen nods)
                         You got a better arm than my ex-wife. 
                         What the hell did you hit me with -- 
                         a statue? I saw a flash of some guy 
                         coming at me.

                                     KAREN
                              (mumbles, embarrassed)
                         It was a crucifix.
                              (to others)
                         It was the only thing there!

                                     TOM
                         Oh, great. Now I'm gonna have people 
                         coming from around the world to see 
                         the face of Jesus on my forehead.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Look, son, what were you doing in 
                         the church?

                                     TOM
                         Looking for a place to hide out.

                                     WAYNE
                         From who -- Swamp Thing?

                                     TOM
                         The bastards who killed my partner.

               That stops the room.

                                     TOM
                         We were driving an armored truck. 
                         The truck got stuck out past the 
                         high school. They must've picked up 
                         our call to dispatch, 'cause they 
                         knew where we were. Charlie and I 
                         were just standing there and all 
                         hell broke loose.

                                     SHERIFF
                         How much money did you have?

                                     TOM
                         A little over three million.

               They all exchange a look -- that's a lot of money.

                                     TOM
                         The bank was afraid of looters. They 
                         had us cleaning out their branches 
                         up and down the river.

                                     WAYNE
                         They stole three million dollars?

                                     SHERIFF
                         No, I don't think so.

               They all look at the Sheriff. He looks at Tom.

                                     SHERIFF
                         You took the money, didn't you.

                                     TOM
                         I hid it in the cemetery. Tied it to 
                         a crypt for a guy named Portman.

                                     WAYNE
                         What the hell'd you do that for?

                                     TOM
                         I don't like to carry around that 
                         much cash.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Jesus, Wayne, use your head. If he 
                         hadn't hidden it, they woulda killed 
                         him, too.

               The Sheriff looks at Tom -- is that it? Tom nods.

                                     SHERIFF
                         You got any ID?

                                     TOM
                         No, it was in my jacket and I --

                                     WAYNE
                         Color me surprised.

               The Sheriff thinks for a beat, then tosses some keys to Phil.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Get out two rifles and a shotgun.

               Phil nods and goes to it. The Sheriff opens a desk drawer, 
               pulls out an ankle holster.

                                     WAYNE
                         You believe him?

                                     SHERIFF
                         Well, yes, Wayne, I do. And even if 
                         I didn't, I'd say we sure as hell 
                         had an obligation to check it out, 
                         don't you think?

               The Sheriff starts strapping on the ankle holster.

                                     TOM
                         I'll go with you. I can show you 
                         where --

                                     SHERIFF
                         No, I think you better stay put. But 
                         that was --

                                     WAYNE
                         Yeah, all we need is an armored car 
                         guy helping us out.

               The Sheriff thwacks Wayne in the ear.

                                     WAYNE
                         Ow!

                                     SHERIFF
                         Wayne, what's the worst that's ever 
                         happened to you? When old Mrs. Dugan 
                         went after you with a knife? This 
                         guy just got shot at!
                              (dismisses Wayne; to 
                              Tom)
                         Smart move with the money.

               Phil comes over with the guns.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (to Phil)
                         Wayne and I'll check out the cemetery. 
                         You escort Slugger...
                              (nods at Karen)
                         ...out of town. Get her to some high 
                         ground, then come on back.

               The Sheriff jams a small pistol into his ankle holster.

                                     KAREN
                         I have to fill the pumps --

                                     SHERIFF
                              (pulling her out)
                         Not any more you don't.

               The Sheriff straightens up, grabs a rifle from Phil and pulls 
               Karen to the door. Wayne goes to Tom's cell door and pulls 
               it shut with a click.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Wayne...

                                     WAYNE
                         He could still be lying!

               The Sheriff rolls his eyes and gestures for Wayne to come 
               along. He opens the door for Karen, Wayne and Phil to go 
               through.

                                     TOM
                         Sheriff -- they killed my partner 
                         without any warning.

                                     SHERIFF
                         And they're gonna regret that, I 
                         guarantee you. They're gonna regret 
                         coming anywhere near this town 
                         tonight. And out he goes.

               EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               Water is halfway up the four-foot high wall of sandbags around 
               the station. There are three outboard motorboats moored to 
               the sandbags.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Phil, take Karen's boat.

               The Sheriff and Wayne climb toward their boats.

                                     WAYNE
                         You can do it, Phil. The men of 
                         Huntingburg are counting on you.

                                     PHIL
                         Just bite me.

               Wayne laughs as he and the Sheriff fire up their boat engines.

               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               Tom hears boat engines start up and move away. He lays back 
               down on the cot, listening to the rain.

               INT. DAM CONTROL OFFICE

               Empty. Light comes out from under the door to the bathroom.

               INT. BATHROOM

               Hank is on the can reading a copy of "American Survivalist" 
               magazine. An odd reaction comes over his face. He feels 
               something weird. He looks down.

               ON THE FLOOR

               Water is seeping in under the door.

                                     HANK
                         Holy shit!

               INT. DAM CONTROL OFFICE

               The bathroom door flies open and Hank waddles out, pants 
               around his feet. He shuffles fast to the control wheels and 
               starts spinning them.

               EXT. RESERVOIR DAM

               Two gates open fast, all the way, and water thunders out.

               INT. DAM CONTROL OFFICE

               Hank pulls up his pants as he gets on the radio.

                                     HANK
                         Sheriff! Sheriff!

               EXT. PARK AREA

               The Sheriff and Wayne are motoring in their boats, zooming 
               through the trees, engine noise obliterating anything coming 
               in over the radio.

               INT. DAM CONTROL OFFICE

                                     HANK
                              (on the radio)
                         Sheriff, come in!

               EXT. MAIN STREET - MOVING BOAT

               Phil steers Karen's small boat down Main Street, past the 
               statue. The water is up to the rider's stirrups.

                                     KAREN
                              (pleading)
                         Did you see the stained glass windows, 
                         Phil? Did you see what a good job 
                         they did? I can't let anything happen 
                         to the church, not after all I've 
                         put into it.

                                     PHIL
                         Karen, you know I'd do anything for 
                         you, but the Sheriff told me to get 
                         you out of town. I'm sorry. It's for 
                         your own good.

               Karen stands up.

                                     PHIL
                         What're you doing?

                                     KAREN
                         If you're not going to take me back 
                         to the church, then I'll swim.

               Karen moves to get out of the boat.

                                     PHIL
                         No. Hey, hold on.

               Phil lets go of the throttle and stands, moving toward Karen.

                                     KAREN
                         What am I saying?

               Karen suddenly turns on Phil and pushes him out of the boat.

                                     KAREN
                         This is my boat. You swim.

               Karen guns the engine and shoots off down a side street. 
               Phil stands in the waist-deep water and watches her go, 
               flabbergasted.

               EXT. CHURCH

               Karen comes around a corner and drives her boat up to the 
               church. The water is swirling quietly, still a good three 
               feet below the top of the wall.

               EXT. ROAD OUT OF TOWN - WELCOME SIGN

               Close on the lighted "Welcome to Huntingburg" sign. There's 
               a rushing sound and a two-foot-high wall of water hits the 
               sign. The lights explode in geysers of sparks and the water 
               rushes on.

               EXT. PARK AREA

               The Sheriff and Wayne are racing through a grove of half-
               submerged trees. There's a rushing sound above the sound of 
               the engines. WHAM! and they're hit by the wall of water. 
               Wayne falls out of his boat and is lost in the swirling water.

               EXT. ALLEYWAY

               Jim and his men are motoring down an alleyway when...

               THE WALL OF WATER

               Rushes down the alley.

               RAY

               The water hits him hard, knocking him off the jet-ski. He's 
               swept away by the water.

               CLOSE ON A FENCE LACED WITH CONCERTINA WIRE

               The surge water shoots through it. And suddenly there's...

               RAY

               Slammed up against the fence, pinned to it, water rushing 
               over and around and by him. He yells as the wire cuts into 
               him.

               EXT. CHURCH

               Karen is pouring gasoline into the pumps.

               She hears the rushing and looks up as the surge hits. Water 
               shoots over the top.

               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               Tom hears the sound and opens his eyes -- what the hell is 
               that?

               EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               The wall of water slams in hard, cascading over the sandbag 
               wall.

               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               TOM SITS UP, SWINGING HIS LEGS OVER THE SIDE OF THE COT. HE 
               REACTS, LOOKS DOWN. HIS POV

               There's two feet of water in the station.

               EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               The building is like a rock in a stream, with the water 
               rushing up high against one wall, roiling and swirling around 
               the sides.

               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               Tom looks over, stunned, to see... THE DOOR

               As a fine stream spits in through the keyhole.

               THE WINDOWS

               Are heaving as the water rises up against them.

               TOM

               Gets to his feet, woozy and goes to get out of the cell. He 
               remembers -- uh-oh: the cell door is locked.

               EXT. ALLEYWAY

               Jim pulls Ray, coughing, choking, bleeding, into the ski-
               boat.

               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               The water level inside is rising fast. It hits the wall 
               sockets and there's a spit of sparks, then all the desk lamps 
               go dark. Light still comes from overhead fluorescent panels. 
               Tom sees...

               TWO KEYS ON A KEY RING

               Laying on the Sheriff's wooden desk. They're four feet away -- 
               too far to reach.

               EXT. CHURCH

               Karen suddenly has a horrible thought and stops. She shakes 
               it off -- doesn't want to think about it -- and mutters to 
               herself.

                                     KAREN
                         They'll get him out.

               EXT. MAIN STREET

               Phil is clinging to the statue as the water surges by below 
               him.

               EXT. PARK AREA

               Wayne gets back into his boat. The Sheriff realizes something.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Wayne... You locked him in.

               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               Tom looks through the cell bars at wooden chairs bobbing in 
               the water. The Sheriff's desk lifts up, starts floating. Tom 
               gets an idea. He takes his belt off.

               EXT. NEAR SHERIFF'S STATION

               A telephone pole is half-submerged, being pulled along fast 
               by the current.

               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               Tom holds one end of the belt and tosses the rest of it at...

               THE DESK

               Bobbing in the rising water. He misses the keys.

               TOM AND THE DESK

               Tom tries again. The belt lands on the desk top.

               Tom very gently starts pulling. Too hard; the belt starts 
               slipping off the desk. He gets it just right and the desk 
               starts moving toward Tom. He reaches out with his hand, 
               stretching.

               HIS FINGERS

               Touch the top of the desk, start pulling it toward him, and 
               he just gets a firm grip on the desk when...

               THE TELEPHONE POLE

               Smashes into a window, bending in the bars on the window, 
               shattering the glass, letting a torrent of water into the 
               room.

               THE DESK

               Is moved by the rush of water, but not before Tom grabs...

               THE KEYS

               And grips them tight.

               TOM

               Tries the keys in the lock. They don't fit. He looks at them.

               CU KEYS

               The tag is emblazoned with the Ford logo.

                                     TOM
                         Great! I can drive out of here!

               Tom tosses the keys into the water and looks around at...

               THE WATER LEVEL

               Rising very fast. A foot in ten seconds.

               TOM

               Climbs up the cell bars, the water rising with him. He's 
               running out of room between himself and the ceiling. Three 
               feet. Two feet. He's being pushed up by the water toward...

               FLUORESCENT LIGHT FIXTURE

               On the ceiling, caged in a wire cover.

               TOM

               Is terrified, about to die. The water rises up past his face.

               TOM'S HANDS

               Pull his Maglite flashlight from his belt. He takes off the 
               lens and the battery cap, then shakes the batteries out.

               TOM

               Sticks the flashlight tube up through the wire grate over 
               the light fixture.

               He blows out the water -- like clearing a snorkel -- then 
               breathes. Reprieve for a few moments and then...

               THE WATER

               Reaches the top of the flashlight tube and starts to trickle 
               in when...

               THE FLUORESCENT LIGHT FIXTURE

               Goes dark. In the darkness, there's the sound of tubes 
               breaking and metal being wrenched.

               TOM

               Looks up, astonished, to see...

               THE FLUORESCENT FIXTURE

               Being lifted up and away from above. Streetlight comes in, 
               silhouetting...

               A FIGURE

               Standing on the roof. The figure leans down and starts tugging 
               at the wire cage over the inside of the fixture. In the light, 
               Tom sees that it's...

               KAREN

               And she's pulling as hard as she can, but the wire cage isn't 
               budging. She pulls out a Swiss Army knife, unfolds a small 
               knife and starts taking out the screws holding the cage in 
               place. She gets two screws out.

               TOM

               Pulls on the cage and it swings down. He climbs up it.

               EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION ROOF

               Tom surfaces in a hole in the roof. There's a vent duct laying 
               on the roof -- Karen must've kicked that over to get to the 
               light fixture. Karen helps Tom up. She sits and he lays down 
               on the roof, catching his breath.

                                     TOM
                         Thank you.

                                     KAREN
                         I owed you -- for hitting you and 
                         all. But we're even now, okay?

                                     TOM
                         Even.
                              (beat, looks around)
                         What happened?

                                     KAREN
                         I don't know.

               They get up.

                                     KAREN
                         Maybe another levee broke upriver. 
                         They've been --

               Just then...

               A PROPANE TANK

               Explodes. The fireball rips across the dark sky, illuminating 
               everything, showing...

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               Fifty feet away -- Jim, Mr. Mehlor and Ray in the ski-boat 
               and Kenny on the jet-ski -- guns aimed at Tom and Karen.

                                     TOM
                         Oh, God.

               DARKNESS

               As the lightning passes, and in the darkness, the thunder 
               rolls.

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               Switch on their lights and move forward. They pass...

               CARS

               Floating down the street with other debris. The cars have 
               been damaged by the flood -- one is missing a door.

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               When they get closer to the Sheriff's station, what they see -- 
               or don't see -- makes them stop.

               THEIR POV

               Tom and Karen have disappeared. Karen's boat is still moored 
               to the Sheriff's station roof, empty.

                                     JIM
                         They're in the water! Kenny, cut 
                         your engine!

               Kenny shuts off the engine of the one remaining jet-ski. Jim 
               shuts down the boat engine. They float in silence, scanning 
               the water with their flashlights. There's no sign of Tom and 
               Karen.

               UNDERWATER

               Tom motions Karen to follow him. She's freaked and hesitates. 
               Tom grabs her hand and pulls her.

               THEIR POV

               The ski-boat and jet-ski are right above them, flashlights 
               playing over the water.

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               Reach the roof of the Sheriff's station. Jim looks around.

                                     JIM
                         Kenny, go that way. We'll go down 
                         here.

               LONG SHOT POV THROUGH CAR WINDSHIELD

               Of Kenny and Jim heading off in different directions.

               TOM AND KAREN

               Rise into view in a car. They gasp for air and keep low.

                                     KAREN
                         Tell them where the money is.

                                     TOM
                         I can't.

                                     KAREN
                         Well, I can.

               She's about to call out. Tom grabs her hard.

                                     TOM
                         If they know where the money is, 
                         they will kill us.

               Before Karen can say anything, a flashlight beam comes 
               swinging toward them and they have to duck underwater.

               JIM

               Watches as his flashlight beam washes over the car. Nothing 
               there. He guns his engine and heads off down the street.

               THE CAR

               Floats off around a corner.

               IN THE CAR

               Tom and Karen surface, catch their breath. Quiet for a few 
               moments as they both look around to see that Jim and his men 
               are gone.

                                     KAREN
                         So what do we do?

                                     TOM
                         I guess just drive around until we 
                         run out of gas.

                                     KAREN
                              (pissed)
                         Look, I've spent the last eight months 
                         of my life restoring that church, 
                         and I just left it to come save your 
                         ass, so spare me, okay?

                                     TOM
                              (beat)
                         When we get down here a little further 
                         we'll find a place for you to hide.
                              (off her look)
                         I'm gonna get back to the truck and 
                         wait for the National Guard.
                              (checks watch)
                         They should be there pretty soon.

               Karen nods. Tom looks at her. She's shivering.

                                     TOM
                         Cold?

                                     KAREN
                         No, I'm fine. The heater just kicked 
                         in.

               Tom looks at her, gives a little grin. Their eyes meet for a 
               second, then they look away.

               EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               Phil climbs up onto the roof, exhausted. He sees the hole in 
               the roof and goes to look at it. As he's looking down...

                                     SHERIFF (O.S.)
                         Is he dead?

               Phil turns to see...

               THE SHERIFF AND WAYNE

               Coasting up in their boats.

                                     PHIL
                         No. Someone got him out.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Who?

                                     PHIL
                              (hesitates)
                         Maybe Karen.

                                     WAYNE
                         Karen? How could she get him out? 
                         You took her out of town.

                                     PHIL
                         I -- It --

                                     SHERIFF
                         Let's hear it, Phil.

                                     PHIL
                         It happened real fast, okay?

               EXT. ALLEYWAY

               Tom and Karen float down the alley in the car.

                                     KAREN
                         You ever been robbed before?

                                     TOM
                         No. The scariest thing that ever 
                         happened before was Charlie running 
                         out of donuts.
                              (off her look)
                         I've only been doing this for a couple 
                         months.

                                     KAREN
                              (not what she wanted 
                              to hear)
                         Oh.

               Silence for a few moments.

                                     KAREN
                         What'd you do before this?

                                     TOM
                         I, uh... I sold construction 
                         machinery.
                              (off her look)
                         I was making good money, it just... 
                         I don't know. It just didn't seem 
                         right for me anymore.

                                     KAREN
                         How'd you end up in this?

                                     TOM
                         My uncle did me a favor; got me in.

                                     KAREN
                         Nice favor. How's he gonna feel after 
                         tonight?

                                     TOM
                         My uncle was Charlie -- my partner 
                         in the truck.

                                     KAREN
                         Oh, God. I'm sorry.

               Tom nods -- so is he.

               EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               Phil climbs into the Sheriff's boat.

                                     WAYNE
                         She know karate or something, Phil? 
                         Maybe kung fu? I mean, I can't see 
                         how else she could overpower the

                         Shut up, Wayne.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Shut up, both of you. Let's go find 
                         Karen; see if she's got him.

               The Sheriff fires up his engine and heads off, Wayne 
               following.

               EXT. ALLEYWAY

               Karen and Tom are still in the car. They freeze at the sound 
               of engines in the distance. The sounds fade. Tom looks around.

                                     TOM
                         God, I wonder whose car this is.

               Karen plucks some cassette tapes out of the water.

                                     KAREN
                         Well, whoever it is, he listens to 
                         Pat Benatar, Eddie Money and the 
                         soundtrack to "Footloose."

                                     TOM
                         Really?
                              (looks at tapes)
                         Hold on...
                              (looks around car)
                         ...I think this is my car from high 
                         school.

               Karen laughs. Just then...

               THE CAR

               Gets caught on something and stops.

                                     TOM
                         Looks like we get out here.
                              (Karen hesitates)
                         Come on -- I told your father I'd 
                         have you home by ten.

               Karen grins. Just then...

               A TRANSFORMER

               down the street explodes.

               TOM AND KAREN

               Hear a sparking sound and look over to see...

               A TRANSFORMER

               On a telephone/power pole close to them. Rain hits it, causing 
               the sparking sound. The floodwater is inching up the pole 
               toward it.

               The water will reach the transformer in a matter of seconds. 
               And while they're staring at that...

               ANOTHER TRANSFORMER

               At the end of the street explodes as water hits it.

               TOM AND KAREN

               Look around -- what to do? Tom points.

                                     TOM
                         There!

               They climb out of the car and start swimming toward a house.

               THE TRANSFORMER

               Water is three inches from the transformer; two inches...

               TOM AND KAREN

               Swimming as hard as they can.

               THE TRANSFORMER

               One inch from the water...

               TOM AND KAREN

               Reach the house. They pull themselves up onto a television 
               antenna/ladder running up the side of the house. Karen's 
               feet are still in the water.

                                     TOM
                         Get your feet up!

               THE TRANSFORMER

               The water is about to touch. There's a sizzling sound.

               TOM AND KAREN

               They heave a huge sigh of relief -- but then Tom realizes...

                                     TOM
                         Oh, shit!

                                     KAREN
                         What?

                                     TOM
                              (re: antenna/ladder)
                         It's metal!

               Tom pushes Karen over onto a window ledge. Then, just as 
               Tom's about to step over...

               KENNY

               Comes screaming in on the jet-ski. He dives off the jetski, 
               gets a hold of Tom and pulls him under.

               KENNY AND TOM

               Surface. Kenny is stronger and he has Tom in a tight grip. 
               One problem -- Kenny doesn't know the danger they're in.

                                     TOM
                         We've gotta --!

               Kenny shoves Tom underwater.

                                     KENNY
                         HEY! I GOT HIM!

               Tom comes up, looks over at...

               THE TRANSFORMER

               The sizzling is getting louder.

                                     TOM
                         We have to --!

               Kenny dunks Tom again.

                                     KENNY
                         I GOT HIM!

               UNDERWATER

               Tom grabs Kenny's arms and pulls himself up fast.

               KENNY AND TOM

               Tom's head comes out of the water and slams into Kenny's 
               chin. Kenny is stunned. Tom gets free of his grasp.

                                     KAREN
                         Hurry!

               Tom does the backstroke, pulling hard toward Karen.

               KENNY

               Still stunned, finally hears the sizzling and looks over 
               at...

               THE TRANSFORMER

               The water touches the outer casing of the transformer.

               KENNY

               Starts swimming fast toward...

               TOM AND KAREN

               Karen grabs Tom's arm and Tom gets a hold of the windowsill 
               and pulls himself up.

               KENNY

               Grabs onto...

               THE TV ANTENNA

               And starts pulling himself out of the water.

               THE TRANSFORMER

               Explodes.

               KENNY

               Feels pretty pleased with himself until...

               THE TV ANTENNA

               Starts dancing with electricity and...

               KENNY

               Is hit by the voltage and his teeth clamp shut and his body 
               goes rigid and his clothes explode in flames.

               TOM AND KAREN

               Look away.

               THE WATER

               Dead fish start floating to the surface.

               KENNY

               Is fried, smoking. He falls off the TV antenna and hits the 
               water with a loud and ugly hiss. He floats away, his body 
               shaking spasmodically.

               TOM AND KAREN

               Tom hears an engine approaching. He looks around, then smashes 
               the window with his elbow.

               INT. HOUSE

               The window glass tumbles in. Tom reaches in, undoes the latch 
               and slides up the window. He climbs in, straddling the window 
               sill. The camera moves down Tom's leg to show...

               A WOLF TRAP

               Laying on the floor, just below the window.

               TOM

               Is oblivious. He starts to put his foot down into the trap. 
               Just then he knocks...

               A POTTED CACTUS

               Off the windowsill. It falls straight down into...

               THE WOLF TRAP

               Hitting the trigger. The jaws snap, obliterating the cactus.

                                     TOM
                         Jesus Christ!

               A SHOTGUN BARREL

               Snaps into view, pointing right at Tom's head.

                                     WOMAN (O.S.)
                         You so much as breathe funny and 
                         your head is going back out that 
                         window without you.

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET

               Jim drives the boat down the street. Mr. Mehlor is scanning 
               the water with a flashlight.

                                     MR. MEHLOR
                         Jim! Over there!

               Jim looks over to see...

               THE JET-SKI

               Floating in the water. And not far from it is...

               KENNY

               Still twitching.

               OMITTED

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               INT. HOUSE - BEDROOM

               Doreen holds the shotgun on Tom and Karen as they move away 
               from the window, hands raised.

                                     DOREEN
                         Real slow now. Like you were in a 
                         big jar of molasses. That's it.

               They hear footsteps coming down old wood stairs.

                                     MAN (O.S.)
                         Doreen? You haven't killed anybody, 
                         have you?

                                     DOREEN
                         I've got everything under control, 
                         Henry. You go back up.

               Henry enters.

                                     HENRY
                         Jesus, Doreen, you caught a whole 
                         gang.

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET

               Jim and Mr. Mehlor pull Kenny into the ski-boat. Kenny is 
               shivering. Part of his hair has been burned away.

                                     KENNY
                         Jesus, God, it hurts!

                                     JIM
                         You're gonna be okay, Ken. Mr. Mehlor 
                         knows these things and he thinks 
                         you're gonna be okay.

               Mr. Mehlor looks at Jim. Mr. Mehlor knows these things and 
               he thinks Kenny is going to die.

                                     KENNY
                         It hurts!

                                     JIM
                         Don't you, Mr. Mehlor? Don't you 
                         think Kenny's gonna be okay?

                                     MR. MEHLOR
                         Yeah, Kenny. You're gonna be fine.

                                     KENNY
                         Jesus, I can't stop shivering.

               Mr. Mehlor moves aside. Jim puts his arms around Kenny.

                                     KENNY
                         I know you didn't want me to come.

                                     JIM
                         You kidding? We couldn't've done 
                         anything without you.

                                     KENNY
                         My dad'd sure be pissed off, huh?

                                     JIM
                         Your dad'd just want you to lay still 
                         while we got you some help.

                                     KENNY
                         Hey -- hey the pain's goin'.
                              (relief)
                         Oh, man.

               He looks up at Jim and grins.

                                     KENNY
                         When you said I was gonna be okay, I 
                         thought you were just shittin' me.

                                     JIM
                         See? You gotta trust me.

               Kenny's shivering stops. It stops because he's dead. Jim 
               slowly lets go.

               INT. HENRY AND DOREEN'S ATTIC

               Henry and Doreen have brought everything into their attic -- 
               a TV, some silver and china, bowling trophies. A Coleman 
               lantern lights the room.

                                     DOREEN
                              (sarcastic)
                         Well, isn't that just wonderful! Now 
                         these bastards are gonna want to 
                         kill us, too! Why the hell did you 
                         have to come to this house?

                                     KAREN
                         We thought it was empty.

                                     DOREEN
                         You know what? The house next door 
                         is empty. So whaddya say we go back 
                         downstairs and you two keep moving?

                                     HENRY
                         We are not going to send these people 
                         out to the wolves.

                                     DOREEN
                         Oh, we're not, are we? Then what's 
                         your plan, General Schwartzkopf?

                                     HENRY
                         I -- I just don't think --

                                     TOM
                         It's okay. I have to go anyway.

               They look at him, surprised.

                                     TOM
                         The National Guard'll be at the truck 
                         in about fifteen minutes. I'm gonna 
                         go wait for them.

                                     DOREEN
                         You can't swim that far in fifteen 
                         minutes.

                                     HENRY
                         He could take our boat.

                                     DOREEN
                         Henry!

                                     HENRY
                              (to Tom)
                         I'll go get it ready for you.

                                     DOREEN
                         Henry, he is not taking our boat.

               Henry ignores Doreen. He pushes the attic stairs down, heads 
               down them.

                                     DOREEN
                              (grabs TV; to Tom)
                         Here. You want a TV too? How about 
                         some china? Maybe our silver?
                              (sets TV down)
                         Henry! Henry, you leave the boat 
                         where it is!

               Doreen heads off down the stairs. Tom starts down the stairs, 
               stops.

                                     TOM
                         Karen?
                              (she looks at him)
                         I'm Tom.

               They shake hands.

                                     KAREN
                         Watch yourself, Tom. I really don't 
                         wanna have to save your life again.

               Tom nods and goes down the stairs.

               EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE

               Henry stands on the roof of the back porch, steadying a small 
               rowboat as Tom gets in. Doreen nags from the window.

                                     DOREEN
                         You give away our only boat in the 
                         middle of a flood. You are a genius, 
                         Henry. A goddamn genius.

                                     TOM
                              (whispers to Henry, 
                              re: Doreen)
                         You wanna come with me?

               Henry looks at Tom, entertaining the notion...

                                     DOREEN
                         Jesus, Henry, what are you waiting 
                         for -- a kiss goodbye? Get back in 
                         here.

               Henry sighs and lets go of the boat. Tom rows off.

               LONG SHOT OF TOM

               We see him in silhouette, crossing the gap between two houses.

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               Are watching, from the shadows on the dark side of the street.

                                     RAY
                         Why don't we just get him?

                                     JIM
                         If our resourceful young friend hears 
                         us coming, he'll electrocute us or 
                         sink us or one of you'll shoot him. 
                         Besides...
                              (glances at watch)
                         ...I know where he's going. What I'd 
                         like to know is where he came from.

               EXT. CHURCH

               The Sheriff sits in his boat, moored to the wall of sandbags 
               around the church. Wayne's boat is tied up next to it. The 
               floodwater is trickling over the top of the wall. The gas-
               powered pumps inside the wall are keeping the waters at bay.

               WAYNE AND PHIL

               Come out of the front doors of the church.

                                     WAYNE
                         They're not here.

               EXT. ROAD OUT OF TOWN - WELCOME SIGN

               Tom rows up to the truck and "Welcome" sign. His flashlight 
               shows just the top of the truck and sign. Tom looks at his 
               watch, ties the rowboat to the sign, jumps into the water.

               A few moments pass, then Tom surfaces, holding a shotgun. 
               Then he senses something behind him and turns to see...

               A COW

               Floating in the water, tongue out, eyes glassy.

               TOM

               Kicks away, horrified. And then he hears an engine. He looks.

               TOM'S POV

               Jim's ski-boat is coming over the water. The engine cuts out 
               and the ski-boat drifts, a hundred feet from Tom.

                                     JIM
                              (yelling)
                         Son, before you go underwater and do 
                         something tricky, there's something 
                         I'd like you to see!

               A flashlight comes on, the beam swivels, illuminating...

               HENRY AND DOREEN

               Standing in the ski-boat, blinking in the light.

               TOM

               Slumps.

                                     JIM
                         Now, I know it's your job to protect 
                         that money, and maybe you'd even be 
                         foolish enough to give your life for 
                         it. The question is, are you willing 
                         to give their lives for it?

               Jim puts a pistol to Doreen's head.

                                     JIM
                         Drop the gun and get into the boat.

               TOM

               Thinks for a second, then throws the shotgun away and pulls 
               himself into the rowboat.

                                     JIM
                         Excellent choice.

               TOM, JIM, HENRY AND DOREEN

               As Tom and Jim call to each other across the water, Doreen 
               goes at Henry.

                                     TOM
                         I'll take you to the money, but you 
                         gotta let them go.

                                     DOREEN
                         I hope you're proud of yourself, 
                         Henry Sears.

                                     HENRY
                         Shh.

                                     JIM
                         I think it'd be best if --

                                     DOREEN
                         I told you not to give him the goddamn 
                         boat.

                                     HENRY
                         Doreen, please.

                                     JIM
                         I think it'd be best if we all stayed 
                         together.

                                     TOM
                         You say all you want is the money? 
                         Prove it. Let them go.

                                     JIM
                         I don't know if that's --

                                     DOREEN
                         We could be safe in our home instead 
                         of out here in a boat with these low-
                         life scumbags!

                                     JIM
                              (after a look at 
                              Doreen, nods to Mr. 
                              Mehlor)
                         Let 'em go.

               EXT. MAIN STREET

               The Sheriff, Wayne and Phil motor past the statue. Wayne is 
               driving his boat; Phil is with the Sheriff. The water is up 
               to the General's neck.

               EXT. ROAD OUT OF TOWN

               Tom helps Henry and Doreen over into the rowboat. As he does, 
               his face comes close to Henry's for a second.

                                     TOM
                              (whisper)
                         Karen?

                                     HENRY
                              (shakes head, whispers)
                         In the attic. They never saw her.

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET

               Karen swims down the center of the street.

               EXT. ROAD OUT OF TOWN

               Tom is in the ski-boat with Jim. He looks out at...

               HENRY AND DOREEN

               As Henry rows them off into the darkness.

                                     DOREEN
                              (disappearing in dark)
                         Faster, Henry! The bastards might 
                         change their minds! Stop lily- dipping 
                         and move it!

               Henry starts to turn the boat around.

                                     DOREEN
                         What're you doing?

                                     HENRY
                         I'm gonna row back there and see if 
                         he'll shoot you. Or me. Fine either 
                         way.

                                     DOREEN
                         Henry...?

                                     HENRY
                         Do you want me to get us out of here?

                                     DOREEN
                         Yes, of course, I --

                                     HENRY
                         Then shut the fuck up.

               Henry turns the boat around and rows off. Doreen is silent.

               JIM'S SKI-BOAT

               Jim shakes his head. Tom looks at Ray, coughing and at Kenny, 
               dead. Tom doesn't know what to say.

                                     TOM
                         I...

                                     JIM
                         The only thing I want to hear from 
                         you is where the money is.

               EXT. STREET

               The Sheriff and Wayne are motoring fast down a street, the 
               Sheriff leading. The Sheriff sees something in the water in 
               front of him. He curses and throttles down fast.

               KAREN

               Is in the water, exhausted and cold.

               EXT. CEMETERY

               Jim pilots the ski-boat into the cemetery. All are aghast.

               A DOZEN CASKETS

               Are floating in the water. Half of them have drifted up 
               against the fence; the others are headed that way.

                                     JIM
                         I wonder where they think they're 
                         going.

                                     RAY
                         What the hell's going on?

                                     MR. MEHLOR
                         This happened in a flood in Georgia. 
                         The ground gets soggy, and the caskets 
                         are air-tight -- anyone who hasn't 
                         been planted too long just pops up.

                                     RAY
                         You teach your students stuff like 
                         that? No wonder they kicked you out.

                                     MR. MEHLOR
                         I didn't teach my students anything 
                         at all.

                                     JIM
                              (to Tom)
                         Where is it?

                                     TOM
                         It's hard to tell now with the water 
                         so deep.

               Jim cocks the hammer on his pistol. Tom gets the hint.

                                     TOM
                         It's down there a little further.

               Jim nods, gives the engine some juice and they move on.

               TOM

               Takes a quick look at his watch.

               JIM

               Sees Tom looking at his watch.

               EXT. STREET

               Karen is in the Sheriff's boat, wearing Phil's jacket, trying 
               to warm up.

                                     KAREN
                         Tom went off in their rowboat.

                                     WAYNE
                              (to Phil)
                         It's Tom now. Looks like you lost 
                         out, pal.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Where was he going?

                                     KAREN
                         Back to the armored truck.

               EXT. CEMETERY

               Jim throttles down the ski-boat engine.

                                     JIM
                         Here?

                                     TOM
                         Uh... no. A little farther --

                                     JIM
                         They're not coming, son.

               Tom looks over at Jim, pretending to be confused.

                                     TOM
                         What?

                                     JIM
                         The National Guard. They're not 
                         coming.

                                     TOM
                         I don't --

                                     JIM
                         I know you've been trying to stall 
                         until they show up, but they're not 
                         coming.

                                     TOM
                              (pause as he realizes)
                         Oh, God. You intercepted Charlie's 
                         call, then you called them off.

                                     JIM
                         No, son, I didn't call them off. 
                         They never were coming. We didn't 
                         "intercept" Charlie's call. He called 
                         us direct.

               And on Tom's look of disbelief...

               INT. DAM CONTROL OFFICE

               Hank is on the radio.

                                     HANK
                         I'd love to help you, Sheriff, but I 
                         can't leave! If the water goes over 
                         the top again it's bye-bye, dam! Bye-
                         bye, town! In fact, I could use a 
                         little help up here myself.

               EXT. PARK AREA

               The Sheriff is in his boat; Wayne is back in his own. The 
               Sheriff is on the radio.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Hank, remember when Mike Crane holed 
                         up in Jack Finch's barn and said he 
                         was gonna burn it down?

               CROSSCUT WITH HANK

                                     HANK
                         Hey, I was the one who got the dumb 
                         son-of-a-bitch to come out.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Right. And before you went in, I 
                         deputized you, you dumb son-of-a-
                         bitch! So when I say get down here, 
                         it's not a request, it's an order. 
                         So get down here! Now! I won't need 
                         you for long. And bring your gun.

               EXT. CEMETERY

                                     JIM
                         We were gonna hit you just before 
                         you got on the Interstate, but then 
                         you got stuck so we had to change 
                         our plans and take you --

                                     TOM
                         Bullshit. This is all bullshit.

                                     JIM
                         I knew Charlie when we were both 
                         working construction for the Johnstown 
                         company. His middle name was McCarthy 
                         because his parents loved Charlie 
                         McCarthy on the radio. His wife's 
                         name was Mary. She died of a heart-
                         attack last year. He has a daughter 
                         and a son, both grown with children 
                         of their own. I'm afraid I don't 
                         know the names of the grandchildren.

               Tom looks down, not wanting to believe.

                                     JIM
                         What else do I know...? Oh, yes. I 
                         know Uncle Charlie was trying to 
                         steer his favorite nephew away from 
                         a life of crime.

               Tom suddenly lunges for Jim. Ray yanks Tom back.

                                     TOM
                         Why'd you shoot him? Kill Charlie 
                         and you get to keep another share?

                                     JIM
                         No, That was an accident. Ken shot 
                         him.
                              (eyes Kenny sadly)
                         I never told him Charlie was on my 
                         side. Ken liked to talk.
                              (shakes head)
                         He shouldn't've been here. But his 
                         dad asked me to watch over him. I 
                         guess I didn't do the best job.

                                     RAY
                         Excuse me, Jim. I hate to interrupt 
                         and all, but could we just get the 
                         money and get the hell out of here?

                                     JIM
                              (nods; to Tom)
                         I'm gonna ask you one more time. And 
                         before you think of bullshitting me 
                         again, keep in mind I have had a 
                         very frustrating night. And while I 
                         know I'll never get the money if I 
                         kill you, it's getting to the point 
                         where I just don't care.

               Jim casually aims his gun at Tom.

                                     TOM
                         I'll tell you where it is. But it's 
                         not going to do you any good.

               Jim arches an eyebrow.

                                     TOM
                         The Guard may not be coming, but 
                         someone else sure as hell is.

               EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN THE SHERIFF

               At the controls of his boat, moving fast, sprayed by rain. 
               Karen and Phil are in the back of the boat. Wayne is close 
               behind in his boat.

               EXT. CEMETERY

                                     JIM
                         I'll take my chances.

               Tom pauses, looks over to...

               THE CRYPT

               Just the top of it is visible. Two more COFFINS float nearby.

                                     TOM
                         There.

               Jim steers the ski-boat over, hands Tom a flashlight.

                                     JIM
                         Well, go get it.

               Tom climbs over the edge of the ski-boat and into the water. 
               He turns on the flashlight and drops below the surface.

                                     RAY
                              (eyeing Tom in water)
                         "At night we'd go down to the river 
                         and into the river we'd dive."
                              (off Jim and Mehlor's 
                              looks)
                         Springsteen, "The River." I'm all 
                         out of bible quotes.

               UNDERWATER

               Tom shines his light on...

               THE CRYPT

               One end of a rope is tied to the crypt. The other end, cut 
               and frayed, is suspended in the water, waving in the current.

               ON THE WATER

               Jim watches Tom's light rise. Tom comes up fast, takes a 
               breath.

                                     TOM
                         It's gone.

                                     JIM
                         What?

                                     TOM
                              (smug)
                         Looks like somebody beat you to it.

                                     RAY
                         Oh for Christs -- I'm gonna shoot 
                         him, Jim.

               Ray grabs pistol in his belt. Before he can pull it out, 
               holes puff out of his chest, followed by blood and then the 
               sound of the rifle-shots. Ray tumbles into the water. A half-
               second later there's...

               HAIL OF BULLETS

               Ripping into the ski-boat, water, trees, crypt.

               THE SHERIFF'S BOAT, WAYNE'S BOAT

               Are outside the fence, a hundred feet from the crypt. PUSH 
               IN FAST on...

               THE SHERIFF

               To the rescue. He and Wayne and Phil fire their guns.

               TOM

               Ducks underwater.

               JIM

               Pulls his pistol, returns fire.

               MR. MEHLOR

               Opens fire with a shotgun, shooting wild, yelling. Then he's 
               hit and knocked out of the boat, dead.

               IN THE SHERIFF'S BOAT

                                     KAREN
                         Stop! You'll hit Tom!

               The Sheriff stops shooting, yells at the others.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Hold your fire!

               Wayne and Phil stop shooting.

               BY THE CRYPT

               Tom is holding onto a coffin, out of view of the Sheriff. He 
               hears a rush of bubbles and turns as...

               JIM

               Comes to the surface, breathing deep.

               JIM'S GUN

               Comes out of the water fast and the barrel goes to Tom's 
               forehead.

               THE SHERIFF'S BOAT

               There's an adrenal fire in the Sheriff's eyes. He starts his 
               boat forward, Wayne following. Their lights find...

               JIM'S BOAT

               No sign of life. Then there's a sound and the lights sweep 
               over to find...

               JIM AND TOM

               Climbing up on top of the mostly-submerged crypt. Jim is 
               behind Tom with his gun to Tom's head.

               THE SHERIFF

               Stops his boat. Wayne stops, too. They are thirty yards from 
               Jim and Tom.

               KAREN AND TOM

               A look passes between them.

                                     JIM
                              (to Sheriff)
                         Now, sir, I can imagine you'd love 
                         nothing more than to shoot me, but I 
                         caution you -- in order to do that, 
                         you're gonna have to shoot through 
                         young Tom here.

               THE SHERIFF

               Thinks for a second, then shrugs.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Okay.

               He raises his rifle.

               KAREN

               Realizes what is about to happen.

               TOM AND JIM

               Also clue in, but before they can move...

               THE SHERIFF

               Squeezes the trigger as...

               KAREN

               Hits the gun with her arm.

               THE RIFLE

               Fires.

               TOM

               is grazed in the arm by the bullet.

               THE SHERIFF

               Smacks Karen hard with his rifle and she tumbles out of the 
               boat, unconscious.

               TOM AND JIM

               Throw themselves back off the crypt as...

               THE SHERIFF AND WAYNE

               Empty their guns in their direction.

               JIM

               Returns fire, shooting blindly over the top of the crypt.

               PHIL

               Reaches for Karen, floating limp in the water, but...

               WAYNE

               Is closer. He grabs Karen and pulls her into his boat, then 
               grins at Phil.

               TOM AND JIM

               Are behind the crypt. Tom holds his bleeding arm. Jim reloads.

                                     TOM
                         Well, that was unexpected.

                                     JIM
                         Is he the one you thought was coming 
                         to your rescue?

               No answer from Tom, but the answer is clear.

               WITH THE SHERIFF AND HIS MEN

               The Sheriff and Wayne reload.

                                     HANK (O.S.)
                         Anyone mind telling me what the hell 
                         is going on?

               The Sheriff, Wayne and Phil turn to see...

               HANK

               In his boat, right behind them, all dressed up in hunting 
               gear, rifle at the ready.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Hey, Hank. That money I told you 
                         about? From the armored car? We're 
                         gonna keep it. Three million dollars. 
                         Four ways.
                              (shoots at crypt)
                         Seven fifty apiece. You okay with 
                         that?

               Hank is stunned. He doesn't answer.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Hank? You okay with that?

                                     HANK
                         Seven hundred and fifty thousand 
                         dollars?
                              (beat, grins)
                         Damn straight I'm okay with that.

                                     WAYNE
                              (grumbling, re: Hank)
                         Don't see what we needed him for.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Then I guess you've never been hunting 
                         with Hank.
                              (to Hank)
                         We got two behind that crypt. Get 
                         'em.

               Hank nods. He motions for Wayne to go one way; he'll go the 
               other. They start off. A blind shot comes from Jim behind 
               the crypt. The Sheriff shoots back. Phil finally musters up 
               the courage to say something.

                                     PHIL
                         Maybe I'm not okay with it.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Come on now, Phil.

                                     PHIL
                         You're gonna kill people?

                                     SHERIFF
                         They're looters, Phil! They come and 
                         steal from an armored truck in our 
                         town -- they're looters.
                              (fires two shots)

                                     PHIL
                         What about Tom? What about Karen? 
                         They're not looters.

                                     SHERIFF
                         No, they're witnesses.

               The Sheriff fires off a flurry of bullets.

               TOM AND JIM

               Behind the crypt, bullets winging by. Jim looks over, sees...

               HANK

               Motor into view.

               JIM

               Opens fire.

               HANK

               Shoots back.

               TOM

               Flattens against the crypt, then turns to see...

               WAYNE

               Coming into view on the other side.

               TOM

               Looks at Jim, sees he's occupied in the fight with Hank. 
               Then he sees...

               RAY

               Floating in the water, dead, pistol still jammed in his pants.

               TOM

               Thinks, decides, and reaches out for Ray.

               CLOSE ON JIM

               Shooting at Hank. He hears gunfire from Wayne and is about 
               to swivel to shoot in that direction when he hears a gun 
               firing from right next to him. He turns to see...

               TOM

               Shooting back at Wayne with Ray's gun.

               WAYNE

               Pulls back out of the line of fire.

               HANK

               Curses and pulls back, too.

               TOM AND JIM

               Exchange a look.

               THE SHERIFF'S BOAT

                                     PHIL
                         How can you do this?

                                     SHERIFF
                         Jeez, Phil, I always thought Wayne 
                         was the stupid one. Read my lips.
                              (slowly)
                         Three million dollars. Look at it!

               The Sheriff reaches down into a forward storage area of the 
               boat and pulls back a tarp revealing the bags of money.

                                     SHERIFF
                         A couple of those bags are gonna be 
                         yours, Phil.

                                     PHIL
                         But -- but -- you're the Sheriff!

               The Sheriff rips his badge off and throws it away.

                                     SHERIFF
                         I'm the what?

               TOM AND JIM

               Jim looks at Tom, then hands Tom his pistol. Tom doesn't 
               know what Jim's doing. Jim slips beneath the water.

               HANK

               Whistles and gets Wayne's attention. He motions Wayne to try 
               it again.

               THE SHERIFF'S BOAT

                                     PHIL
                         For twenty years you've been --

                                     SHERIFF
                         For twenty years I've been eating 
                         shit, breakfast, lunch and dinner. 
                         Well, tonight I'm changing the menu! 
                         From now on everything I eat is gonna 
                         be shit-free!

               BEHIND THE CRYPT

               Tom is looking for Jim, to see what he's doing. And then...

               WAYNE AND HANK

               Come around on both sides.

               TOM

               Starts shooting at them with the two pistols.

               WAYNE AND HANK

               Pull back. As they go...

               TOM

               Sees...

               KAREN'S ARM

               Draped over the side of Wayne's boat.

               TOM

               Takes another shot at Hank but stops firing at Wayne.

               CLOSE ON JIM'S SKI-BOAT

               Jim's hand appears over the gunwale. He reaches in and 
               grabs...

               MR. MEHLOR'S PACK

               And pulls it out of the boat.

               THE SHERIFF'S BOAT

                                     SHERIFF
                         Can I make it any clearer, Phil? Do 
                         you want me to draw pictures?

               Phil pulls out his revolver and points it at the Sheriff.

                                     PHIL
                         I can't let you do it.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Oh for --
                              (beat)
                         Okay, Phil. But here's how it's gonna 
                         go. I'm gonna hear one of two things 
                         out of you. Either I'm gonna hear 
                         you say you're in with us, or...
                              (moves close to Phil's 
                              gun)
                         ...I'm gonna hear a bullet come out 
                         of that gun and go into me.

               Phil is incredulous. The Sheriff weighs his hands like scales.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (one hand)
                         Seven hundred and fifty thousand 
                         dollars or...
                              (other hand)
                         ...you kill me. Your choice.

               The Sheriff weighs the hands a couple more times. Phil slumps, 
               lowers the gun.

                                     SHERIFF
                         There we go.

               SOMETHING

               Flies through the air; lands in the water by the Sheriff. 
               It's...

               MR. MEHLOR'S PACK

               And it starts sinking in the water.

               BEHIND THE CRYPT

               Tom sees...

               JIM

               Haul himself into the ski-boat.

                                     WAYNE (O.S.)
                         In the boat!

               THE SHERIFF, WAYNE AND HANK

               Start shooting at Jim in the ski-boat.

               JIM

               Sticks the shotgun over the gunwale and returns fire.

               TOM

               Starts swimming for the boat.

               THE SHERIFF, WAYNE AND HANK

               See Tom and start shooting at both he and Jim when...

               MR. MEHLOR'S PACK

               Explodes and...

               THE WATER

               Erupts in a huge geyser.

               THE SHERIFF, WAYNE, PHIL AND HANK

               Are knocked off their feet. The Sheriff, Phil and Hank are 
               thrown into the water. Their boats are rocked up and back 
               and swamped with falling water.

               JIM

               Fires up his engine.

               TOM

               Is almost to the boat.

               WAYNE

               Gets to his knees in his boat and starts shooting.

               TOM

               Gets to Jim's boat and grabs onto it.

               JIM

               Cranks the throttle, and, dragging Tom, tears off under the 
               hail of Wayne's bullets.

               TOM'S POV

               As Jim races through the tombstones, barely missing 
               halfsubmerged stone crosses and crypt roofs.

               TOM

               Rams into one cross.

               HIS HANDS

               Start to slip from the boat.

               JIM

               Grabs Tom's hand and holds on as they shoot off across the 
               water.

               THE SHERIFF, PHIL AND HANK

               Get back in the boats.

               EXT. ON THE WATER - MOVING

               Jim hauls Tom into the boat. Tom lays on the bottom, catching 
               his breath. Blood is dripping down from his arm.

                                     TOM
                              (beat, looks up at 
                              Jim)
                         You really want that money?

               Jim gives Tom a look -- of course he wants that money.

                                     TOM
                         'Cause the only way you're ever gonna 
                         see it is if you help me get Karen.

               Before Jim can answer, gunshots ring out behind them. They 
               look back to see...

               THE SHERIFF AND HIS MEN

               Coming after them in the three boats, shooting, closing.

                                     TOM
                         We're too slow.

                                     JIM
                              (thinks, then:)
                         Here.

               Jim moves away from the wheel, giving it to Tom. Tom gets up 
               and takes over. Jim bends and picks up...

               KENNY

               Lifeless and limp.

               JIM

               Looks at Kenny for a moment, then pushes his body overboard.

               WITH THE SHERIFF AND HIS MEN

               Flying over the water.

               THEIR POV

               They see a body tumble out of the ski-boat.

               WITH JIM AND TOM

               Jim looks back, following Kenny with his eyes.

               EXT. MAIN STREET

               Jim and Tom make the turn onto Main Street. They look back 
               as...

               THE SHERIFF AND HIS MEN

               Come around the corner, two hundred yards back.

                                     TOM
                         They're not going to catch us now.

               LOW ANGLE

               Of the ski-boat, racing toward camera. As it gets closer, 
               the camera BOOMS DOWN underwater to reveal...

               THE STATUE

               The sword tip just below the surface. THE SKI-BOAT

               There's a jarring metal on metal clank as the sword tip slams 
               into the propeller.

               JIM AND TOM

               Are thrown forward.

               JIM

               Slams head-first into the dash.

               UNDERWATER

               The propeller has stopped.

               TOM

               Looks back to see that...

               THE OUTBOARD MOTOR

               Has almost been ripped from its moorings.

                                     TOM
                         Okay, so maybe they are gonna catch 
                         us now.

               No answer from Jim. Tom looks down.

               JIM

               Is laying on the deck, unconscious. Just then... BAM! BAM! 
               BAM!

               HANK

               Has his rifle resting on his boat's windshield and is firing 
               off a clip on automatic as he, Wayne and the Sheriff close 
               in.

               TOM

               Ducks down and tries to start the engine. No go. Again. It 
               catches on the third try. Tom guns it and the boat tears 
               off.

               THE OUTBOARD ENGINE

               Is wobbling, vibrating.

               HANK

               Keeps up his stream of gunfire.

               TOM

               Stays down, driving blind, as the bullets fly in, blowing 
               holes in the windshield. He looks at Jim, at the engine and 
               curses. He steers the boat toward...

               THE CHURCH

               All lit-up, brilliant white in the darkness, a quarter-mile 
               away.

               EXT. THE CHURCH

               The water is now over the sandbag wall. The first several 
               feet of the church are flooded.

               THE SKI-BOAT

               Comes up fast. Tom grounds it on top of the sandbag wall. 
               Tom hesitates for a half second before grabbing Jim and 
               pushing him out of the boat and into the water.

               JIM

               Hits the cold water and comes to, sputtering.

               TOM

               Grabs guns and ammo and jumps out of the boat and into the 
               water. He lays a rifle on the top of the sandbag wall and 
               fires off a clip.

               THE SHERIFF, HANK AND WAYNE

               Jim's bullets plug into their boats. They circle back.

               AT THE CHURCH

               Tom pushes Jim, still groggy, into the flooded church.

               INT. CHURCH

               Tom shuts the door. He piles the weapons on a shelf. He sees 
               Jim touch his head.

                                     TOM
                         That hurt?

                                     JIM
                         Yeah.

                                     TOM
                         Good.

               EXT. MAIN STREET

               Wayne and Hank are alongside the Sheriff, engines idling as 
               they look at the church.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (nods, to Hank)
                         Then go get some bottles.

               Hank nods, guns his engine.

                                     PHIL
                              (to Hank)
                         Wait -- what about the dam?

                                     SHERIFF
                         It'll be fine.

                                     PHIL
                         You said if it goes it'll wipe out 
                         the town.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Fuck the town.

               Hank nods in agreement and takes off.

               INT. CHURCH

               Jim and Tom are by one of the stained glass windows, looking 
               out through a pale-colored pane at the Sheriff and his men 
               across the street. They watch Hank race off.

                                     JIM
                         Does he have the girl?

                                     TOM
                              (shakes head)
                         She's in the small boat.

               Tom touches the wound on his head.

                                     TOM
                         Jesus, I'm gonna get hepatitis.

                                     JIM
                         Hepatitis, hell. You probably already 
                         got cholera.

               Tom gives Jim a look then starts for the back of the church.

                                     JIM
                         What're you doing?

                                     TOM
                         There's a back room.
                              (touches wound)
                         Maybe they've got something I can 
                         use on this.

                                     JIM
                         You been in here before?

                                     TOM
                              (bad memory)
                         Oh, yeah.

                                     JIM
                         What happened?

                                     TOM
                         I saw Jesus.

               EXT. DAM

               Water is starting to go over the top again. It pours down in 
               sheets over the face of the dam.

               INT. CHURCH

               Jim is by the window, looking out at the Sheriff and Wayne 
               across the street in the shadows. He turns as...

               TOM

               Enters from the back. He's got a bottle of rubbing alcohol 
               and a towel. He splashes some of the alcohol on the towel, 
               then touches it to his wound. It hurts like a sonofabitch. 
               After a beat...

                                     TOM
                         So, has this all gone pretty much 
                         how you thought it would?

               Jim turns on Tom.

                                     JIM
                         Everything would have gone fine if 
                         you'd've just walked away from the 
                         truck.

                                     TOM
                         Oh, yeah? Well, everything would've 
                         gone even better if you hadn't decided 
                         to rob the damn truck in the first 
                         place!

               Jim looks away. After another silence...

                                     TOM
                         Did Charlie have cancer or something?

                                     JIM
                         You mean why was he doing this?
                              (thinks, shrugs)
                         No cancer.
                              (beat)
                         Didn't you ever think about taking 
                         the money?

                                     TOM
                         No.

                                     JIM
                         Come now. A man who used to make his 
                         living fencing hot jackhammers never 
                         thought about what he'd do with three 
                         million dollars?

                                     TOM
                         Sorry to disappoint you.
                              (beat)
                         What are you gonna do with it?

                                     JIM
                         As little as possible.

               Silence for a few moments, then...

                                     TOM
                         Belize.

               Jim looks at him.

                                     TOM
                         It's this small country in Central 
                         America, on the Atlantic side.

                                     JIM
                         I know where Belize is. What about 
                         it?

                                     TOM
                         They speak English and the dollar 
                         goes a long way. Beautiful beaches; 
                         friendly people. And they've got 
                         liberal banking laws. Very liberal.

                                     JIM
                         No, you didn't think about taking 
                         that money at all.

                                     TOM
                              (busted)
                         You can't ride in the truck and not 
                         think about it.

                                     JIM
                         I'm sure. And I guess that's pretty 
                         much how it started with Charlie.

               Tom thinks, nods and presses the towel to his wound again.

               EXT. MAIN STREET

               Wayne is thinking about something. He makes a decision and 
               flicks on his engine.

                                     SHERIFF
                         What're you doing?

                                     WAYNE
                         We got too many bodies with bullets 
                         in 'em.
                              (nods at Karen)
                         I'm gonna put her in her house, make 
                         it look like she fell down the stairs 
                         and drowned.

                                     PHIL
                         Don't you touch her!

                                     WAYNE
                         Saving her life... Hmm... You know, 
                         that might have actually gotten you 
                         laid.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Oh, for Christsakes, just dump her 
                         here.

                                     WAYNE
                         We got a few minutes before Hank 
                         gets back.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Just dump her here!

               Wayne ignores the Sheriff and motors off.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Wayne! Goddamnit, we've gotta get 
                         them outta there! Wayne!

               But Wayne keeps going.

               INT. CHURCH

               Tom watches Wayne drive off with Karen.

                                     TOM
                         Shit. Where's he going?

               Tom grabs a rifle, frustrated and angry.

               EXT. MAIN STREET

               Hank motors up to the Sheriff and Phil.

                                     HANK
                         Where's Wayne going?

                                     SHERIFF
                         On a date. You all set?

                                     HANK
                         Yeah, but --

                                     SHERIFF
                         Then let's go.

                                     HANK
                         Aren't we gonna wait for Wayne?

                                     SHERIFF
                         We can get started without him, the 
                         dumb shit. He won't be long. Besides, 
                         we got Phil. Phil's gonna earn his 
                         money on this, aren't you Phil?

               Phil looks scared shitless.

               EXT. RESERVOIR DAM

               Water continues to pour over the top. CLOSE ON CONCRETE

               Chunks of cement are starting to wash away.

               INT. CHURCH

               Tom finishes reloading a gun.

                                     JIM
                         What -- you're gonna swim after her?

               Tom doesn't answer. He moves toward the front door. Jim cuts 
               him off.

                                     JIM
                         You ain't gonna help her by getting 
                         shot. He's gone and you don't know 
                         where.

                                     TOM
                         The Sheriff knows. I think maybe 
                         I'll go ask him.

                                     JIM
                         You'll be dead before you get over 
                         the sandbags.
                              (beat)
                         Look, he'll be coming for us. You 
                         can ask him then.

               Jim sees something out the window.

                                     TOM
                         What if he doesn't come?

                                     JIM
                         I wouldn't worry about that.

               Tom sees what Jim sees.

               THEIR POV

               The Sheriff, Phil and Hank are heading toward the church, 
               flaming Molotov cocktails in their hands.

               EXT. SIDE OF CHURCH

               The Sheriff, Phil and Hank heave the flaming Molotov 
               cocktails.

               THE ROOF

               The bottles hit, explode. Sheets of fire rain down the roof.

               ONE BOTTLE

               Smashes through a window.

               INT. CHURCH

               Tom and Jim duck down as...

               THE BOTTLE

               Flies across the inside of the church and smashes against a 
               wall, sending sheets of fire down the wall.

               EXT. CHURCH

               The roof is on fire.

               EXT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               Modest, two-story, on a side street. The front door is open; 
               the boat tied up outside. There's a light on in the front 
               hall.

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               Karen is unconscious. Wayne has her laying on the stairs 
               leading up from the entry area to the second floor. There's 
               three feet of water in the house. Karen's legs are in the 
               water. Her hands are handcuffed to a railing attached to the 
               wall, running up the stairs. Wayne stands over Karen, pats 
               her face.

                                     WAYNE
                         Wakey-wakey.

               Karen stirs, then starts slipping back into unconsciousness, 
               so Wayne splashes her face with water. Karen comes to, 
               sputtering. Her eyes focus. She looks up at Wayne. Wayne 
               grins.

                                     WAYNE
                         Dear Penthouse: I always thought 
                         your letters were fake, until the 
                         wildest thing happened to me. I'm a 
                         policeman in a small town. In the 
                         middle of the big flood last year, I 
                         was patrolling the streets in a boat, 
                         feeling kind of sorry for myself -- 
                         'cause it was my birthday and all -- 
                         when I saw the front door to a house 
                         was open. I pulled my gun -- afraid 
                         it might be looters. Imagine my 
                         surprise when, instead of a looter, 
                         I find a young woman handcuffed to 
                         the railing of her stairs. Her name 
                         was Karen, and ever since she came 
                         back from college she'd made it clear 
                         she was too good for any of us local 
                         folk. Now here she was, in handcuffs! 
                         I said, "What the heck is going on 
                         here, ma'am?" And she said...

               Karen says nothing. Wayne leans in close.

                                     WAYNE
                         And she said...

                                     KAREN
                         Sorry, Wayne, but I'm not playing a 
                         part in your sick little play.

               Wayne pulls his gun, puts it to Karen's head.

                                     WAYNE
                         You're perfect for the role. I suggest 
                         you reconsider.

                                     KAREN
                         Or what? You'll kill me? You're gonna 
                         do that anyway.

                                     WAYNE
                         I might get clumsy. It might take a 
                         while.

                                     KAREN
                         I'm sure you can hurt me. But it's 
                         all going to be the same when I'm 
                         dead.

               Wayne straightens up, looks at her, then launches back into 
               it.

                                     WAYNE
                         And she said, "Happy Birthday, Wayne. 
                         I've got something for you." Well, 
                         I'm not stupid. I knew what she wanted 
                         to give me and I knew she wanted to 
                         give it bad, so I --

               THE OVERHEAD LIGHT

               Sparks and goes out.

                                     WAYNE
                              (looks up at light)
                         That won't do. Man's gotta see what 
                         he's doing. 'Scuse me.

               Wayne heads off for the kitchen. The second he's gone...

               KAREN

               Raises her hips and digs a hand into her pocket and pulls 
               out her Swiss Army knife. She pries open the big blade. She 
               hears Wayne sloshing back toward her. She gets back into the 
               position Wayne left her in as...

               WAYNE

               Re-enters carrying two burning candles in candle-holders.

                                     WAYNE
                         I got the candles. All's we need is 
                         a cake.

               He sets the candles down on a dry step above Karen's head. 
               He leans in close.

                                     WAYNE
                         Mood lighting. You in the mood yet?
                              (no answer from Karen; 
                              back into Penthouse 
                              letter)
                         And then she said, "My present's 
                         ready and waiting. All's you gotta 
                         do is unwrap it."

               Wayne reaches into the water, undoes Karen's rain pants, 
               yanks off her shoes, then pulls off her pants. He throws 
               them over the banister. Karen remains passive, blank. Wayne 
               takes off his holster; hangs it on the banister. Then he 
               pushes his pants down to his ankles. His shirttail is long 
               enough so that we don't have to see his wretched little 
               pecker. He climbs on top of Karen in the water, brings his 
               face close to hers.

                                     WAYNE
                         It was cold and rainy that birthday 
                         night, and all I wanted was to get 
                         someplace warm and dry. As it turned 
                         out, what I really wanted was 
                         something warm and wet. Wayne grins 
                         and closes for a kiss and...

               KAREN'S HAND

               Moves fast with the knife and...

               WAYNE'S EYES

               Pop open wide.

               WAYNE

               His head jerks back. He tries to shout, but all that comes 
               out is an awful gurgle. He tries to push off Karen, but...

               KAREN

               Wraps her legs around him, holds him close, pinning him.

               WAYNE

               Finally breaks free. He tries to stop the bleeding with a 
               hand, but the blood spurts through his fingers. He reaches 
               for his gun in his holster on the banister, but just as he 
               grabs it...

               KAREN

               Lashes out of the water with her legs, kicking Wayne in the 
               groin, pushing him back.

               WAYNE

               Tries to get his balance, but his feet can't move -- his 
               pants are around his ankles. He falls back into the water, 
               firing his pistol.

               BULLETS

               Blow chunks out of the wall next to Karen, hit the ceiling 
               and...

               WAYNE

               Is floating on his back, trying to lift the pistol, but his 
               strength is fading fast. He gets off one last shot and...

               THE CANDLE

               Nearest Karen is blown to pieces.

               WAYNE

               The gun drops into the water. No more shots. No more life. 
               He floats, pants around his ankles, covered in blood, dead.

                                     KAREN
                         Happy Birthday, Wayne.

               EXT. STREET AND CHURCH

               The church roof is on fire.

               THE SHERIFF, PHIL AND HANK

               Are across the street.

               INT. CHURCH

               Jim and Tom hear a creaking and look up.

               THE CEILING

               The fire has eaten holes in the roof. Embers come down.

               EXT. CHURCH AND STREET

               The Sheriff is getting very agitated.

                                     SHERIFF
                         They're not coming out, Hank!

                                     HANK
                         The fire's not catching. The rain's 
                         too --

                                     SHERIFF
                         We have to get them! We have to kill 
                         them! Do you understand? If they're 
                         not dead, we got jack shit!

               INT. CHURCH

               A small chunk of burning ceiling drops down. Jim and Tom 
               look up. Just then...

               BRIGHT LIGHT

               Floods into the church through...

               THE STAINED GLASS WINDOWS

               Filling the church with a kaleidoscope of colors.

               TOM AND JIM

               Look out the windows.

                                     TOM
                         My God they're beautiful.

               THE STAINED GLASS WINDOWS

               Remain beautiful for a few more seconds until they shatter 
               and blow inwards as...

               THE SHERIFF'S BOAT AND HANK'S BOAT

               Come crashing through.

               THE BOATS

               Land, stop fast. The Sheriff's boat lands closer to the 
               pulpit; Hank's boat closer to the balcony.

               THE SHERIFF, HANK AND PHIL

               Look around. It's quiet for a moment. There's no sign of Tom 
               and Jim.

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               Karen has her pants back on. She reaches out with one foot 
               and hooks Wayne's holster off the banister. She flips it 
               through the air and catches it with her hands. She opens 
               little leather pockets -- mace, more bullets. No keys. Karen 
               starts to panic.

                                     KAREN
                         There have to be keys. There --

               She sees...

               WAYNE

               Still floating on his back, still dead. She looks closer 
               at...

               WAYNE'S PANTS

               Bunched around his ankles. And there, hanging from a belt-
               loop is a ring of keys.

               KAREN

               Reaches out with her foot for Wayne's pants. She can't reach.

               WAYNE

               Is slowly drifting out the open door. Beyond the door, in 
               the light of the streetlamp, the water is riffling, moving, 
               and Wayne is heading toward it.

               KAREN

               Slides down further on the stairs, into the water, then stops.

               CLOSE ON HANDCUFFS AND RAILING

               There are metal supports going from the railing to the wall, 
               every three feet. Karen is prevented from going any further 
               down the stairs by one of these supports.

               KAREN

               Reaches out with a foot, straining, stretching her body, 
               almost dislocating her shoulder and...

               HER FOOT

               Just barely touches one of Wayne's feet, but then Wayne's 
               foot slips away and...

               KAREN

               Can only watch as...

               WAYNE

               Drifts out the door and is pulled away by the current.

               EXT. RESERVOIR DAM

               Water is cascading over the top of the dam. Chunks of concrete 
               are washing away.

               INT. CHURCH

               The Sheriff, Phil and Wayne scan the water, looking for 
               movement.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Where are they?! Jesus!

               UNDERWATER POV

               Looking up through a tangle of floating pews at the wavering 
               silhouettes of the boats and the men in them against the 
               burning timbers above.

               TWO PISTOLS

               Come into view, pointed up through the water.

               ON THE WATER

               The Sheriff, Phil and Hank have let down their guard for a 
               second when there's a series of dull, muted clacks from 
               underwater as...

               BULLETS

               Come streaking out of the water, winging by them, plugging 
               into the boats.

               UNDERWATER

               Jim fires the pistols, the bullets' bubble streaks knifing 
               up through the water.

               THE SHERIFF, PHIL AND HANK

               hit the deck in their boats, returning fire over the gunwales.

               TOM

               Surfaces over by the stairs up to the balcony, gasping for 
               air. He runs for the stairs.

               BLAZING TIMBERS

               Start to fall from the burning roof frame, hitting the water 
               with loud sizzling hisses.

               THE SHERIFF, PHIL AND HANK

               Turn to shoot at tom through the dropping flaming debris.

               TOM

               Disappears up the stairs, the bullets just missing him.

               UNDERWATER

               Jim runs out of bullets. He's long since run out of air. He 
               drops his guns and swims under the pews.

               HANK

               Looks up, realizing that Tom will be able to shoot down on 
               him. He reverses his boat fast under the balcony as...

               TOM

               Shoots down from the balcony, blowing a chunk out of the 
               prow of Hank's boat.

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               The water is up to Karen's chin. Her hands are working 
               frantically beneath the water.

               UNDERWATER

               She's using the tip of the knife blade to unscrew the screws 
               holding the support to the railing. She's on the last one. 
               The blade slips, misses, gets a quarter turn, another quarter 
               turn...

               KAREN

               Spits out the water that spills into her mouth.

               UNDERWATER

               Another quarter-turn and the screw is loose enough to turn 
               by hand.

               KAREN

               Holds her breath with the water touching her nose. She gets 
               the screw loose, pulls up on the railing and pulls the 
               handcuff through the gap between the support and the railing.

               INT. CHURCH

               The Sheriff turns to Phil and nods re: Jim.

                                     SHERIFF
                         You take care of him!

               The Sheriff aims at the balcony as Phil scans the water, 
               looking for Jim.

               UNDERWATER

               Jim pulls an electrical cord out of a wall socket.

               ON THE BALCONY

               Tom ducks down as the Sheriff's bullets start plugging through 
               the wood front of the balcony. Tom moves away from the bullet 
               strikes, splashing through the water in the balcony.

               CLOSE ON BALCONY FLOOR

               As BANG BANG BANG -- bullets start shooting up from below.

               HANK

               Is firing up at Tom through the floor of the balcony.

               TOM

               Jumps back, startled, looking down at...

               THE BALCONY FLOOR

               Holes explode in the floor, sending up small geysers of water. 
               The water then starts whirlpooling down through the holes.

               TOM

               Moves back from hank's advancing bullet holes.

               THE SHERIFF

               Keeps firing.

               TOM

               Is caught between Hank's bullets and the Sheriff's bullets. 
               So he racks a load in the shotgun and dives backwards off 
               the balcony.

               HANK

               Is still shooting up as...

               TOM

               Arcs off the balcony, firing the shotgun under the balcony 
               at Hank.

               HANK

               Dives to the floor of his boat as Tom's shotgun blasts blow 
               plate-sized holes in the church doors.

               TOM

               Lands in the water and goes under.

               THE SHERIFF AND PHIL

               Look for Tom in the water.

               HANK

               Starts to get up from the bottom of his boat, searching for 
               a clip for his gun.

               THE SHERIFF

               Sees Tom's shape in the water and is about to shoot when...

               JIM

               Jumps up out of the water with the electrical cord. He tosses 
               a loop of the cord around the Sheriff's neck and pulls, 
               yanking the Sheriff out of the boat.

               TOM

               Comes out of the water, aiming his shotgun at...

               PHIL

               Who is aiming his pistol at Tom. Phil freezes.

               THE SHERIFF AND JIM

               Struggle in the water. Jim pulls the cord tightly around the 
               Sheriff's neck as the Sheriff tries to get a shot off at Jim -- 
               he can't get the barrel pointed at Jim.

               HANK

               Fumbles with the bullet clip.

                                     HANK
                              (to Phil)
                         Kill him!

               TOM

               Turns his shotgun on Hank and pulls the trigger -- click. Uh-
               oh.

                                     HANK
                         Kill him!

               TOM AND PHIL

               Exchange a look.

               HANK

               Slams the clip into his gun and levels it at Tom.

               PHIL

               Points his gun at Hank.

                                     PHIL
                         No! We can't --

               BANG! and hank shoots Phil. Phil pitches back out of the 
               Sheriff's boat.

               PHIL

               Lands between Jim and the Sheriff, knocking them apart.

               THE SHERIFF

               Is free of Jim's grasp. He shakes off the electrical cord 
               and turns to shoot...

               JIM

               Who moves a little faster. He grabs Phil's pistol and puts 
               it to the Sheriff's head before the Sheriff can bring his 
               gun around.

               HANK

               Draws a bead on Jim and is about to shoot when...

               TOM

               Comes out of the water on the other side of Hank's boat. Tom 
               pushes down hard on the side of the boat.

               HANK

               Is rocked back, thrown off balance. He starts to spin and 
               bring his gun around when...

               TOM

               Swings with the shotgun, catching...

               HANK

               In the side of the head. Hank crumples and falls into the 
               water, taking his rifle with him.

               JIM AND THE SHERIFF

               Jim nods at the Sheriff's rifle.

                                     JIM
                         In the boat.

               THE SHERIFF

               Hesitates, then tosses his rifle into the boat.

               TOM

               Grabs Hank's rifle and aims it at the Sheriff.

                                     TOM
                         Where's Karen?

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               Karen undoes a last screw in a metal support.

               She pulls the handcuff through the gap between the support 
               and railing. She's at the top of the stairs.

               THE END OF THE RAILING

               Curves and goes into the wall.

               KAREN

               Tugs at the railing, tries rocking it up and down. It doesn't 
               budge. She starts chipping at the plaster with the knife.

                                     KAREN
                         God, I am really beginning to hate 
                         fine craftsmanship.

               THE WATER

               It's up to her chest.

               INT. CHURCH

               The Sheriff hesitates.

                                     TOM
                         Where is she?

                                     SHERIFF
                         They went back to her house.

                                     TOM
                         Where's her house?

                                     SHERIFF
                         It's --

               And just then they all hear something truly ominous -- a 
               siren pierces the night.

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               She reacts to the siren -- uh-oh.

               INT. CHURCH

               The siren wails.

                                     JIM
                         What in God's name is that?

                                     SHERIFF
                         Hank?

                                     HANK
                              (woozy but okay)
                         It's topped out.

                                     SHERIFF
                         How much time we got?

                                     HANK
                         How should I know?

                                     SHERIFF
                         Guess!

                                     HANK
                         It's an old dam! Not long.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (to Tom)
                         Then I'd say you boys better drop 
                         your guns.

                                     TOM
                         What?

                                     SHERIFF
                         That's the deal! You let me and Hank 
                         go -- with a few of these bags -- 
                         and I'll tell you where to find Karen.

                                     JIM
                              (to the Sheriff)
                         Get out of the boat.

                                     TOM
                         Hold on.

               Jim turns to look at Tom.

                                     JIM
                         Hold on?

                                     SHERIFF
                         It's the only way you're gonna find 
                         her!

                                     TOM
                         It's only a couple of bags.

                                     JIM
                         No.

                                     TOM
                         But I thought --

                                     JIM
                         Look, I don't know what you thought 
                         but I told you, I'm here for the 
                         money; that's all.

               Tom doesn't know what to do. The Sheriff looks pretty pleased 
               with himself. He might just get out of this. And then...

                                     PHIL (O.S.)
                         She lives on Boyd Street.

               They all look over at...

               PHIL

               Alive, but barely.

                                     PHIL
                         Three over. Two-story, blue shutters.

               TOM

               Looks at Jim, disappointed, angry, then hurries to Hank's 
               boat.

               JIM

               Climbs into the Sheriff's boat.

               TOM

               Climbs into Hank's boat. He starts the engine, looks down 
               at...

               PHIL

               Floating in the water, dying. A brief look between them, 
               then...

               TOM

               Drives the boat out through a shattered window.

               JIM

               Pushes the Sheriff out of the boat.

               EXT. RESERVOIR DAM

               A large V is being cut in the top of the dam by the raging 
               water.

               A QUARTER-MILE AWAY

               Looking back at the dam. The line of lights on top of the 
               dam start to fall over, then go dark, snuffed out by an unseen 
               force.

               INT. CHURCH

               Jim keeps his gun leveled at the Sheriff and Hank, standing 
               in the water, as he pulls the money bags up from the forward 
               hold.

                                     SHERIFF
                         So, you just gonna kill me?

                                     JIM
                         Lord knows I should.

               Jim opens a money bag and smiles at what he sees.

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               Karen tilts her head back to keep her lips and nose above 
               water. And then she hears a window smash. She turns as...

               TOM

               Wades in along the upper hall.

                                     TOM
                         I'm guessing you can't get up.

                                     KAREN
                         I'm handcuffed.

               Tom reaches into the water for the railing.

                                     KAREN
                         The railing's bolted to the wall.

               He looks at her.

                                     KAREN
                         I've got a saw.

                                     TOM
                         Where?

                                     KAREN
                         In the kitchen. In the tall cupboard 
                         beside the --

               And then they hear a sound more ominous than the siren -- 
               they hear the siren stop.

                                     TOM
                         Is that good or bad?

               INT. CHURCH

               Jim, the Sheriff and Hank react to the silence. Jim looks 
               off.

               THE SHERIFF

               Drops underwater.

               JIM

               Turns back at the sound of the Sheriff going under.

               UNDERWATER

               The Sheriff pulls up his pant leg.

               JIM

               Is aiming his gun at the water and is about to fire as...

               THE SHERIFF'S HAND

               Comes out of the water shooting a pistol.

               JIM

               Is shot in the gut and the thigh and high on the chest and 
               he stumbles back, bellowing, and falls out of the Sheriff's 
               boat and into the water.

                                     SHERIFF
                         You should've just killed me.

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

                                     KAREN
                         You gotta go!

               Tom starts hyperventilating.

                                     KAREN
                         The dam's gone! You gotta go!

                                     TOM
                              (shakes head)
                         I owe you one.

               Tom breathes deep then ducks underwater.

               UNDERWATER

               Tom flicks on his flashlight and starts swimming down the 
               stairs.

               KAREN

               Watches Tom and his light get swallowed up in the murky water.

               INT. CHURCH

               Phil is grabbing for the Sheriff's boat as the Sheriff and 
               Hank zoom out of the church, leaving him behind.

                                     PHIL
                         NOOOO!

               EXT. MAIN STREET

               The Sheriff's boat comes onto Main Street, moving fast.

               IN THE BOAT

               Hank is looking back, in the direction the flood will come.

                                     HANK
                         We gotta go faster!

                                     SHERIFF
                         Yeah, you're right.

               The Sheriff pushes Hank out of the boat.

               HANK

               Goes skipping over the water and slams into a streetlight 
               post.

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               Tom swims down into the living room. His light shows a couch, 
               chairs, TV set. Books and newspapers are suspended in the 
               water.

               EXT. THE CHURCH

               The damaged ski-boat that Jim and Tom took to the church has 
               slipped off the sandbag wall and is drifting. A peaceful 
               scene. But then, from the distance, comes a rushing roar.

               INT. CHURCH

               Phil hears the roar. He looks around, lost.

               EXT. STREET

               Hank, groggy in the water, also hears the distant roar.

               INT. CHURCH

               The roar is building, getting louder. Phil sees something in 
               the water and reaches for it, frantically. He gets it. It's...

               A BIBLE

               And he clutches it to his chest as...

               THE FLOOD

               Hits the church.

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN

               Tom swims into the kitchen. He looks for the tall cupboard 
               by the fridge. He opens it.

               INSIDE THE CUPBOARD

               Hanging on a hook on the back wall is a saw. Tom grabs it.

               EXT. MAIN STREET

               Hank unwraps himself from around the lamp post. He looks 
               back.

               HIS POV

               Streetlights in the distance, winking out one by one, marking 
               the advance of the wall of water.

                                     HANK
                         Oh my God.

               Hank looks around for safety. He sees it.

               HIS POV

               There's an alleyway.

               HANK

               Swims for the alley.

               EXT. THE ADVANCING FLOOD

               Roars through the town, pushing a rolling wave of debris, 
               obliterating anything in its path.

               EXT. ALLEY

               Hank swims into the alley. Hank looks for something to climb 
               up on, to hold onto. There's...

               FIRE ESCAPE LADDER

               At the end of the alley.

               HANK

               Swims for it. He hears the rushing roar of the advancing 
               flood. He expects the flood to blow by the end of the alley. 
               Wrong.

               WALL OF WATER

               Comes into the alley, banking high on the far wall before 
               coming down and barreling toward Hank. And what makes it 
               worse for Hank is that there's...

               A CAR

               At the front of the wave, being pushed by the water.

               HANK

               Dives clear just as...

               THE CAR

               Smashes into the wall, right where Hank had just been.

               HANK

               Relief in his eyes. He gets to the fire escape and is climbing 
               to safety when...

               PROPANE TANK

               Comes into the alley, rolling in the flood, spraying propane 
               from a torn hose. It explodes.

               HANK

               Barely has time to scream.

               INT. KAREN'S KITCHEN - BREAK OF DAWN

               Tom is threading his belt through the handle of the saw to 
               secure it. He gets it done and starts to swim out of the 
               kitchen.

               BACK TO KAREN

               Just Karen's lips and nose are above water.

               IN THE KITCHEN

               Tom is about to leave when everything starts to move -- 
               rocking, from side to side, as if in a slow motion earthquake. 
               Cupboards and the fridge open and bottles and food and plates 
               tumble out.

               EXT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               The house has been hit by the flood. It's being pulled by 
               the massive current, stretching overhead phone and power 
               lines.

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               Karen hears the groaning, ripping as the house tears free 
               from water and sewer lines. She's looking down for Tom when 
               there's a snap and the light above her goes out.

               EXT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               The house is carried on the current, turning in the water.

               IN THE KITCHEN

               Tom watches, astounded, as the room starts to turn around 
               him. He kicks fast for the door to...

               THE LIVING ROOM

               Tom swims in, fast, toward the stairs when...

               A WINDOW

               Caves in and...

               HUGE TREE BRANCH

               Smashes in, filling the room, blocking Tom's route to the 
               stairs.

               TOM

               Tries to get through the tangle of branches and leaves, but 
               can't. He swims over to another window and slides it up.

               KAREN

               Keeps looking down for Tom.

               EXT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               The house is impaled on a tree, the current sluicing around 
               it.

               TOM

               Surfaces near the side of the house, gasping. The current 
               starts ripping him past the house. He swims as hard as he 
               can back to the house, reaches out and grabs onto a gutter.

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               Karen doesn't have much time left. The water is washing over 
               her mouth and nose. And just as she's about to go under...

               TOM

               Swims in with the saw. He starts sawing on the handrail. 
               Everything's going fine. And then...

               THE SAWBLADE

               Snaps.

               TOM AND KAREN

               Look at each other. Oh no. Karen's going under.

               TOM

               Sees something. He dives into the water.

               KAREN

               Can only watch and wait. What's he doing? Oh, Jesus. And 
               then...

               TOM

               Surfaces, holding Wayne's pistol. He puts the mouth of the 
               barrel to the handcuff chain, shields Karen's face, looks 
               away and pulls the trigger.

               EXT. A TREE IN WATER

               The water swirls through the branches of a half-submerged 
               tree.

               HENRY AND DOREEN

               Are in the tree. Henry is either unconscious or dead. Doreen 
               cradles him.

                                     DOREEN
                         Come on, Henry. Forget that "Go to 
                         the light" crap. Come back to me. 
                         You're all I've got.

               And Henry starts to come to.

                                     DOREEN
                         Oh, Henry. Thank God.

               Henry opens his eyes.

                                     HENRY
                         Next time, when I say "Let's 
                         evacuate," we're gonna evacuate.

                                     DOREEN
                         Whatever you say, honey.

               She hugs him tight and after a beat he hugs her back.

               EXT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               Tom and Karen swim out of a second floor window, grab the 
               rain gutter. Tom pulls himself onto the roof then grabs Karen 
               and helps her up. They crawl until they're clear of the edge. 
               Only the sloped roof of the house is visible in the swirling 
               water. They are just catching their breath when they are hit 
               by...

               BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT

               And they look to see...

               THE SHERIFF

               In his boat, shining a searchlight on them with one hand, a 
               gun in the other. He starts shooting.

               TOM AND KAREN

               Tom pushes Karen toward the peak of the roof as the bullets 
               plug in around them. Tom pushes Karen over the top then turns 
               and dives off the roof and into the water.

               KAREN

               Hears an engine behind her and turns.

               A BOAT

               Racing toward the house. It's...

               THE SKI-BOAT

               And at the controls is...

               JIM

               Barely alive.

               THE OUTBOARD MOTOR

               Is wobbling, vibrating at the back of the boat, almost loose 
               from its moorings.

               JIM'S POV

               He sees Karen, crouched below the peak of the house, a bright 
               light coming from the other side along with gunshots.

               JIM

               Pushes the throttle all the way forward.

               THE SKI-BOAT

               Shoots forward.

               UNDERWATER

               Tom swims hard toward the Sheriff's boat.

               THE SHERIFF

               Is shooting down into the water at Tom's moving shape.

               THE SKI-BOAT

               With Jim at the wheel, comes racing straight toward the house.

               KAREN

               Thinks he's going to turn.

                                     KAREN
                         No! No!

               THE SKI-BOAT

               Doesn't turn.

               KAREN

               Rolls to the side, just getting clear as...

               THE SKI-BOAT

               Hits the sloping roof of Karen's house and ramps up it.

               THE OUTBOARD MOTOR

               Digs into the shingles of the roof and tears free from the 
               back of the boat.

               THE SHERIFF

               Hears the sound and looks up as...

               THE SKI-BOAT

               Comes over the peak of the roof.

               TOM

               Surfaces to see...

               THE SKI-BOAT

               Fly right over him, heading straight for...

               THE SHERIFF

               Who ducks down, just in time as...

               THE SKI-BOAT

               Misses him, landing just past him in the water.

               THE SHERIFF

               Straightens up, grinning with glee that the boat missed him. 
               And then he hears a piercing whine coming from behind him. 
               He turns, just in time to see...

               THE OUTBOARD MOTOR

               Flipping end over end, propeller whirring, heading straight 
               for him.

               THE SHERIFF

               Starts to scream.

               CLOSE ON KAREN

               Looking over the peak of the roof in horror. She hears the 
               Sheriff's scream and the scream of the propeller and then a 
               horrible ugly ripping and both screams stop.

               THE SHERIFF'S BOAT

               The Sheriff is gone. The side has been smashed out of the 
               boat and the boat is flooding with water.

               THE SHERIFF

               Is just some misshapen thing trailing red, floating in the 
               water.

               JIM

               Tries to restart the ski-boat but it's dead. He slumps 
               forward.

               TOM

               Sees Jim slump against the side of the boat.

                                     TOM
                         You okay?

                                     JIM
                         Fine.

               Tom can tell Jim's anything but. Tom swims for the boat.

               THE BOAT

               Tom swims up, pulls himself in. He pulls Jim back off the 
               controls, sees the blood.

                                     TOM
                         Oh, God. We gotta get you to --

               Jim looks at Tom. Tom understands -- Jim's not going anywhere.

                                     TOM
                         Thanks.

                                     JIM
                         For what?

                                     TOM
                         You just saved our lives.

                                     JIM
                         I did? I just came for the money.

               Tom looks at Jim -- he knows Jim's lying.

                                     KAREN (O.S.)
                         Do you need any help?

                                     JIM
                              (grabs Tom's arm)
                         No. Tell her to stay back.

                                     TOM
                              (to Karen)
                         It's okay!

               Jim lets go of Tom.

                                     JIM
                         You're going to turn it in?

                                     TOM
                         Sorry to disappoint you.

                                     JIM
                         Well, hell, then I guess I better 
                         take it after all. I figure the 
                         river'll carry me down to the Gulf 
                         of Mexico. If I catch the right 
                         currents, maybe I'll end up in... 
                         Belize?
                              (Tom nods)
                         You come look me up. I'll buy you a 
                         drink.

                                     TOM
                         I'll do that.

               Jim grimaces as he's hit by a wave of pain. He looks away.

                                     JIM
                         Go.

               Tom hesitates for a second.

                                     JIM
                         Please.

               Tom turns and slides into the water and swims away.

                                     JIM
                         Son, don't think too badly of your 
                         Uncle Charlie. He always said you 
                         were capable of remarkable things.
                              (beat)
                         He was right.

               There's a last look between Jim and Tom, then Tom swims away.

                                     JIM
                              (smiles)
                         The rain's stopped.
                              (breathes deep)
                         The air after a rain...

               Jim slowly topples forward and is still.

               TOM

               Swims through the swirling current toward Karen's roof.

               JIM'S BOAT

               Sinks below the surface and is gone.

               TOM AND KAREN

               Karen is down at the water's edge with her arm extended to 
               Tom. Tom grabs it, and as Karen pulls...

                                                              MATCH CUT TO:

               EXT. CHURCH - SUNSET

               Karen pulls Tom up onto scaffolding running along the edge 
               of the new roof under construction. Tom holds a paper bag. 
               He's wearing work gear -- tool belt, work boots, etc. Tom 
               looks at the work being done on the roof.

                                     TOM
                         They got a lot done today.

                                     KAREN
                         It's coming along.
                              (re: bag)
                         What'd you get?

                                     TOM
                         Barbecue chicken from Lilly's.

                                     KAREN
                         Yum.

                                     TOM
                         You want some? I wish you'd told me. 
                         I woulda got more.

                                     KAREN
                         Ha ha.

               And as they sit down and start to eat, the camera begins to 
               PULL BACK.

                                     TOM
                         I talked to Mikey. He says the 
                         flooring should be in by Friday.

                                     KAREN

EXT. CEDARS-SINAI - WIDE - DAY

A monolith with alienating foregrounds. A bus pulls in on
Beverly. NEIL McCAULEY and a nurse get off. Neil carries
a paper bag and wears white pants like a hospital attendant.
Neil is an ice-cold professional: very big, very tough.
At 42 his short black hair is graying. He spent eight
years in McNeil and three in San Quentin. He got out and
hit the street in 1987. Four of the McNeil years were
spent in the hole. Neil's voice is street, but his language
is precise like an engineer's. He's very careful and very
good. Neil runs a professional crew that pulls down high
line, high number scores and does it anyway the score has
to be taken down: if on the prowl (a burglary), that's
fine; if they have to go in strong (armed), that's fine
too. And if you get in their way, that's got to be your
problem. His lifestyle is obsessively functional. There's
no steady woman or any encumbrance. Neil McCauley keeps
it so there's nothing he couldn't walk from in 30 seconds
flat.

ANGLE

Right now, he enters the big double doors and pulls a white
intern's coat from his paper bag.

INT. CEDARS-SINAI CORRIDOR - TRAVELING TWO SHOT - DAY

We DOLLY on Neil as he crosses through the long crowded
corridor. Patients, nurses, interns and doctors pass by.
A P.A. broadcasts occasional messages.

PROFILE

Nail crosses under an "EMERGENCY" sign and keeps going
towards the exit doors.

TRAVELING - FRONTAL

Neil APPROACHES THE CAMERA. From the other direction two
ambulance attendants wheel an old man under oxygen and
pass by Neil.

WIDE REAR SHOT

Without breaking his stride from the moment he got off the
bus, Neil exits through the doors, examines four ambulances
parked in the slots, climbs into one and drives off. Maybe
he's stolen it. We don't know.

EXT. R & C CONSTRUCTION SUPPLIES - ON CHRIS - DAY

CHRIS SHIHERLIS crosses past stacks of gravel and cement
with a white-coated BLACK CLERK. Chris wears a hard hat
over a mongol cut, Levi's, black boots and a sleeveless
sweat shirt and carries on one shoulder a 150 lb., red,
Milwaukee Tool Company case. He looks like a construction
worker by day who by night hits L.A's slams, jams and raves.
He's 29, from Austin, Texas. Chris is also a highline
pro: a boxman who knows five ways to open any safe made.
Right now he's buying a hollow core drill. He and McCauley
were cellmates in San Quentin Penitentiary from 1984 to
1987. Chris hit the streets in 1988. He's a hot dog and
spends money as fast as he makes it. Right now, he and
the Clerk exit to the sales counter.

          Cash. Put "Jack's Fencing" on
          the receipt.

          $788.   30

Chris pays; Clerk writes receipt.

              (continuing)
          ...that a good racket? I ought

          Yeah.
              (beat)
          Take it easy.

He leaves with the heavy red case.

INT. "TOYS 'R' US STORE" - ON CERRITO - DAY

MICHAEL CERRITO - at 40 - is looking at a doll house.
He's a wide, thick, coarse-featured big man. Sicilian
from Sunnyside, he's spent 15 years in Attica, Joliet and
Marion penitentiaries. He's strictly a "cowboy": his
natural inclination towards a score is "...get the guns
and let's go." He's been off smack and everything else
for five years. He's clean and sober. He's the nicest
guy on the block and a loving father. If you get in his
way, he'll kill you as soon as look at you. If you asked
him about the contradictions, he wouldn't know what you
were talking about.

CLOSE OR DOLL HOUSE DETAILS

It's 3 x 6 and two feet high. Miniature room sets are
inside. Cerrito's thick fingers close the door. He picks
it up. WIDEN. He crosses to a counter and MIDDLE-AGED
CLERK.

                      CERRITO
          Wrap this here up.

                      CLERK
          Yessir. You're going to have a
          happy little girl.

                       CERRITO
          Two.   I got two girls.

                         CLERK
          That's nice.

                       CERRITO
          Yeah. And gimme those three
          masks there.

Clerk takes down Clark Gable, Three-eyed Monster, and
Beautiful Lady, full-head rubber masks.

              (continuing)

Slides across the back of JUSTINE'S thigh.

JUSTINE'S AND HANNA'S FACES

She is 29, auburn,  languorous, her eyes are closed and she
makes love with her  husband, VINCENT HANNA. Pressing her
face to his, their  hair intertwined... It's morning. We
are in an expensive  condominium.

The two bodies locked into the rhythms of their love-making,
twisted in white sheets. OFF SCREEN a shower runs.

             Falls back on the pillow,
             disappointed. It's as if she'd
             been stood-up. The bed sheet
             falls half off of her. She's
             exposed, vulnerable. She looks
             out the window, occluded by light
             muslin, away from us and exhales.

He climbs in. Cerrito pulls out. Waingro - delayed -

            there were eight scenes of
            transcendental loneliness. They
            painted them over and over again.
            One is a flock of geese hovering
            over a field. There's always
            mist. It's painted just as the

          What is it?

                      CEZAR
          A bank. On Thursdays it gets
          cash deposits for distribution
          to other branches. The branches
          have to buttress their cash
          accounts to handle Friday payroll
          checks from a Toyota and Nissan
          plant, a steel mill and two
          refineries. One day a week,
          Thursday, the main branch carries
          the full whack.

                      NEIL
          You want a $100,000 advance,
          against a full 101. Why?

Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org   34.


               CEZAR
   'Cause I can get it. 'Cause
   this is the best thing I seen in
   three years. 'Cause a screw-up
   makes 10 percent of nothin' equal
   nothin'. And 'cause those are
   the terms and they ain't
   negotiable.

   On the prowl or strong?

               CEZAR
   Strong. Through the front door.
   During the day.

               NEIL
   How many guys?

                CEZAR
   Four.   Three plus a driver.

               NEIL
   That's not a $100,000 worth
   anything. You're giving me an
   address to what's strictly a
   cowboy score: "Get the guns and
   let's go!" We smash, grab and
   boogie while they hit the alarm.

               CEZAR
   Three alarms. And that's why
   the price. 'Cause you chop-in
   through the roof the night before
   on the prowl and bypass 'em. I
   got circuit diagrams, blue prints,
   the works. So yeah, they hit
   the alarms, but nothing gonna
   happen.

               NEIL
   Do I have to kill people?

               CEZAR
   I doubt it. Two men have the
   two keys to open the box.

          I want pictures of who he moves
          and sits with. Then run makes

Neon under the vapor lamps. O.S. the cacophony of horns

                       RICHIE
               (to Hanna)
           Here's how we found her.

POLAROID - BLACK PROSTITUTE

in a nightgown, folded over the lip of a garbage can at
the waist. She's a pitiful rag doll. Someone killed her
and then threw her away.

HANNA

is too controlled.    Anger's underneath.

                         HANNA
           How old?

                       RICHIE
           Sixteen, seventeen.

                       HANNA
           How'd she die, Richie?

                       RICHIE
           Blunt instrument. Cerebral
           hematoma.

                       HANNA
           Who are they?

THEIR POV: HEAVYSET BLACK WOMAN

and two stunned young boys. She's crying and arguing with
two uniformed LAPD trying to hold her back. One LAPD is a
black woman. The heavyset woman doesn't really know what
happened yet except it's bad.

                         RICHIE (O.S.)
               (low)
           The family.

                       HANNA (O.S.)
           What the hell are they doin'
           here?

RICHIE + HANNA

                       RICHIE
               (low; shrugs)
           It's fucked up. Somebody inside

Now Richie bends over the body bag on the ground and unzips
it. We don't see the dead girl. We only see Hanna. A
third uniformed officer in the background spins away.

                      HANNA
          Oh, this is nice.

                      RICHIE
          I wanted you to see this 'cause
          I got a feeling it's serial and
          gonna end up in your court.

                      HANNA
          Homicide getting anywhere?

                      RICHIE
          Nowhere.

Hanna rises. The mother's arguing with the man cop because
she wants to see. Horror and hysteria blossoming through
shock. She pushes the uniformed cop of the way. Hanna
goes to try to help. They grapple.

                      MOTHER
              (reaches out)
          Baby! Where's my baby.!

Anguish. It's a mess. The woman collapsing into Hanna's
arms. For one moment Hanna's eyes lock onto hers. He
freezes. One doesn't forget the look he sees in her eyes.

MAN

crawls under the pick-up and   Neil's car and emerges on the
passenger side behind Neil's   rear wheel in Neil's blind

          someone in Taipei. It was like
          I was a piece of furniture: "Go
          be his wife." After I left he
          won't talk to me. Because I

          people tell roe what to do again.
          And that trust comes from knowing
          someone over time.

          This is hard between us for me.

Waingro winds up and cracks the girl.     She knocks over a

Nothing. Then the Pontiac with its lights off rolls

pads down the five steps to the rear entry of the jewelry

surgical gloves on his hands. The others stay in the car.

curious. He raises his head over the edge and his eyes go
wide. WIDEN. He's inches from the back of Cerrito's head.
Cerrito twists and turns and jerks back in effort - almost
touching Jackson. Cerrito's too absorbed to sense Jackson's
presence. Jackson carefully closes his eyes and sinks
down.

EXT. GENERAL LIQUORS, LAS VEGAS - WIDE - DAY

A "Las Vegas Police Department" car pulls to the curb.
Hanna and Schwartz get out and cross the crabgrass, dirt,
and debris-filled forecourt to a cheaply constructed wood
and glass one-story building.

Hanna rips open Marciano's desk drawer finds a gun, unloads
it, throws it on the floor, finds a small tape recorder,
pops the tape out and tosses it to Schwartz. Then he
flashes a badge at Marciano.

                        MARCIANO
            L.A.P.D. Who the hell you think
            you're pushing around? You got
            no jurisdiction and I know people
            here!

                       SCHWARTZ

            So what?

            You go back to Newark on a New
            Jersey warrant for smuggling
            cigarettes up from North Carolina
            three years ago or you go to
            work for us. Cut and dried.

No answer.    Chris and Cerrito are thinking.

             For me, the bank's worth the
             stretch. I say accept the risk,

          I got an idea what they're looking
          at. You know what they're looking
          at?

Hanna turns his back on the rest of the detectives and a
big smile dawns upon his face. He raises his arms out
wide. Hanna turns in one direction, then another. Schwartz
doesn't understand.

                      HANNA
              (continuing; to
               Schwartz)
          Is that guy something; or is
          that guy something? I mean, you
          gotta give this crew credit.
          They are so fucking good...

          Know what he's looking at?

VERY TIGHT ON HANNA IN 3/4 REAR SHOT

The image vibrates. Hanna says more. We don't hear it.
We HEAR a CAMERA SHUTTER CLICK. The IMAGE FOCUSES and
DEFOCUSES. Another CLICK.

          Us. The L.A.P.D. The Police
          Department. We just got made...

Hanna laughs.

EXT. KNOLL - L.S. HANNA - TWILIGHT

Pull back to reveal he's being surveilled by Neil. He's
been photographing Hanna with a black Nikon on a tripod
with a 1300Mm Questar Reflector lens. Neil's made his
tail. The recce in the blue Cadillac was bait. Neil half
returns Hanna's smile. He climbs into the Caprice. Cerrito
roars off, leaving a cloud of dust which billows into mauve
against the deep sky.

          His name is Hanna; first name,

          Lieutenant in major Crimes Unit.
          He's taken down some heavy crews.
          Blew away Frankie Yonder in

          Dedicated. Divorced three times.
          Current wife's Justine. He's
          why the extra heat.
              (pause)
          Vice sergeant says Hanna likes
          you. Thinks you're some kind of
          'star.' 'You do this sharp, you
          do that sharp. Look how sharp
          this guy is to figure that.'

Neil laughs.

                      NATE
              (continuing)
          Funny as a heart attack.
              (pause)
          With this guy and this much heat,
          you should pass on the bank.

             We took some major scores

Hanna leaves. Then Justine looks at where he stood. Her
cold demeanor cracks, then reassembles and she lights a
roach, takes a hit, dumps it in the toilet and finishes
her makeup.

plate into the piles of dirty dishes   and rests on his

Both cars pull onto the shoulder. Out of the unmarked

He approaches Neil's car.

NEIL

watches Hanna approach, wary.    He didn't expect this to

          No. My wife spends half her

          stepdaughter's got problems 'cause
          her real father's a world class
          asshole. And every moment I

          A man told me once: you want to

          to walk out on in 30 seconds
          flat if you feel the heat around

          So if you're chasing me and you
          gotta move when I move, how do
          you expect to keep a family?

Marciano does. Charlene seems to soften and relax and
take satisfaction at Marciano's put-down.

            Yes.

                        FARINA
            Well, you're right. You would
            be. But if you don't betray
            Chris, you betray Dominick.
            Because he becomes an orphan
            when you go to prison as an
            accessory 'cause you got no living
            parents to take him. Then he
            ends up state-raised and fucked
            for life. Your son Dominick's
            innocent. He didn't choose a
            life like that. Chris did.

Charlene rises and crosses to a bedroom and looks in the
door - presumably at Dominick.

            Give up Chris. You get off clean.

Charlene sits - shell-shocked - dressed in black with white
face and red lipstick. Marciano re-enters with a drink
for her.  Charlene looks towards the bedroom containing
Dominick, then nods her head "yes." Farina dials a number.

          You can lounge around her $1.7
          million condominium on her sofa.
          You can do all those things.
          But you do not get to watch my

Hanna lifts it off the table, spilling framed pictures.   A
commercial segues to a quiz show.

MISS WALLER The imperfect subjunctive, like the imperfect indicative, indicates action in the past. "II voulait qu'elle lui donnat de l'argent." Translate, somebody . . . quickly!

A SCHOOLGIRL - LAURA - blurts out from the front of the class.

LAURA 
"He wanted her to give him some money."

MISS WALLER 
(Angry) Put your hand up! I will not have girls talking out of turn in my class!

The door opens and Miss Stewart brings Juliet into the room.

The presence of the headmistress causes the class to stand up.

MISS STEWART
Good morning, gels.

CLASS (In Unison) Good morning, Miss Stewart.

The class sit.

MISS STEWART
Miss Waller . . . class . . . this is Juliet Hulme. Juliet is joining us from St. Margaret's, and prior to that she spent some time at Queenswood in the Hawkes Bay.

Juliet looks at Miss Stewart haughtily.

JULIET
I am actually from England, Miss Stewart.

MISS STEWART
Of course . . . Juliet's father is Dr. Hulme, the Rector of the University.

Miss Waller looks impressed. Pauline is quietly drawing horses at the back of the class.

MISS STEWART
Juliet's travelled all over the world, and I'm sure she'll be very eager to share her impressions of exotic lands across the seas with the gels of 3A. I'll leave you to it, Miss Waller. Juliet.

Miss Stewart leaves. Miss Waller smiles at Juliet.

MISS WALLER 
You can sit over here, Juliet.

Miss Waller gestures to a desk at the front. She gives Juliet a cardboard name card.

MISS WALLER 
We use French names in this class. You can choose your own.

Miss Waller returns to the blackboard and starts writing.

MISS WALLER 
Now, irregular verbs in the present subjunctive. . . "qu'il vienne". . .

JULIET
Excuse me, Miss Waller . . . you've made a mistake.

Miss Waller turns to Juliet-who now has the name "Antoinette" hanging around her neck.

JULIET
"Je doutais qu'il vienne" is in fact the spoken subjunctive.

MISS WALLER 
It is customary to stand when addressing a teacher . . . "Antoinette."

Juliet stands.

JULIET
You should have written "vint."

Miss Waller frowns, glances at the board, and hastily rubs out the offending word.

MISS WALLER 
(Embarrassed mumble) Oh! I must have copied it incorrectly from my notes.

Juliet stands again.

JULIET
You don't have to apologise, Miss Waller. I found it frightfully difficult myself . . . until I got the hang of it.

Miss Waller turns to Juliet, her face clouded with anger. The class looks terrified.

MISS WALLER 
(Icily) Thank you, Juliet. Open your text-book to page 17.

Pauline is smirking.

INT. SCHOOL ART CLASS - DAY
The teacher, MRS. COLLINS, comes in, carrying a pile of paper and a box of paints. She starts to distribute them around the tables.

MRS. COLLINS 
Right, I thought we'd do some life drawing today. Pair off into twos and decide who wants to model and who wants to draw.

The girls around Juliet turn to each other, seemingly eager not to be partnered with her. They pair off and Juliet is left alone.

MRS. COLLINS 
Oh, Juliet. . . you haven't got a partner.

JULIET
That s all right, Mrs. Collins. I'm sure I can manage without one.

Mrs. Collins scans the class.

MRS. COLLINS 
Pauline . . . are you with anybody?

Pauline shakes her head.

MRS. COLLINS 
Good! You can come here and pair up with Juliet.

Pauline reluctantly comes up to Juliet's table.

SERIES of SHOTS showing VARIOUS GIRLS sketching their partners. Most of the posing girls are seated in contrived positions with rigid grins on their faces. Mrs. Collins patrols the class, commenting to different girls.

MRS. COLLINS 
You might want to change the colour- make it a bit darker . . . that's very nice, Joan.

PULL BACK. . . to reveal Pauline's "pose" . . . slumped in the chair, arms crossed, a sullen look on her face. She stares intently at Juliet, who is drawing furiously . . . but doesn't refer to Pauline at all.

MRS. COLLINS 
Good heavens, Juliet! What on earth is this???

Mrs. Collins picks up Juliet's drawing. It features an armoured knight on horseback, fighting a dragon.

JULIET
St. George and the Dragon.

Mrs. Collins studies the detail in the drawing.

MRS. COLLINS 
Where's Pauline?

JULIET
Oh, I haven't gotten around to drawing her yet. I was going to pop her on a rock, but I seem to have run out room.

Juliet glances at Pauline.

JULIET
Sorry! I don't know if you've noticed, Mrs. Collin but I've actually drawn St. George in the likeness of world's greatest tenor-Mario Lanza!

MRS. COLLINS 
Yes, I know it's very clever, Juliet, but when I set you a topic, I expect you to follow it. Now put that down and start again!

Mrs. Collins moves on. Juliet looks up at Pauline rather grumpily. Pauline leans forward, an intense look on face . . .

PAULINE
(Whispers) I think your drawing's fantastic!

Her husband, HERBERT, has just arrived home and is taking off his coat, looking at the mail, etc. He is nearly 60 . . . 15 years older than Honora.

The Riepers' house is clean and tidy. They are a low middle-class family on a modest income.

HONORA 
Oh! . . . Mackerel. We'll have them for lunch tomorrow.

Herbert comes up behind Honora, gives her a peck on cheek and puts his hand on her bum.

HERBERT 
Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?

HONORA 
playfully shoves his hand away.

HONORA 
I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.

HERBERT 
sighs as HONORA puts the frying pan on the stove.

young student boarder, STEVE BAYLISS, appears in doorway, nervously clutching a record.

STEVE 
Excuse me . . . would you mind if I put my long-playing record on?

HERBERT 
You're partial to a nice bit of mackerel, aren't you, STEVE?

STEVE 
 Well . . . actually, I'm not much of a fish man, Mr. Rieper.

HONORA 
glances at his album.

HONORA 
You have been splashing out!

STEVE 
 Oh! . . . I've got my board money . . .

STEVE 
 starts fishing in his pockets.

At this moment . . . Pauline comes into the kitchen, through back door. She strides past Honora, HERBERT and STEVE

PAULINE
(Brightly) Hello!

HONORA 
Well? Tell us! How'd it go?

Pauline disappears into the lounge.

PAULINE

HONORA 
Don't worry about it now. We'll sort it out after dinner. You go put your record on.

STEVE backs toward the hallway door, holding his Doris Day album forlornly.

HERBERT chuckles at him through the kitchen doorway.

HERBERT 
(Laughing) Ya gotta be quick in this house, mate!

Pauline stares misty-eyed at the album cover. HERBERT 
calls out.

HERBERT 
(O.S.) (Tongue in cheek) Hey! Isn't it that Irish singer . . . Murray O' Lanza?

PAULINE
(annoyed) He's Italian, Dad! The world's greatest tenor!

Mario Lanza starts singing . . . HERBERT comes into the lounge, miming the song with a limp fish. He gesticulates a grand operatic fashion.

PAULINE
Stop it! You're spoiling it! Go away!

She pushes HERBERT out of the room, into the kitchen.

Pauline and Juliet are sidelined on a bench. Pauline is writing in a textbook. She notices Juliet glancing at her leg. Juliet moves closer.

JULIET
Can I have another look?

Pauline purses her lips and quickly pushes her left stocking down . . . She has a large ugly scar running up her left shin, from ankle to knee.

JULIET
That's so impressive!

Pauline does not look convinced.

JULIET

Pauline puts her bike on its stand. She pulls the Mario Lanza album out of her bicycle bag.

Pauline is about to approach the house when she glances across the garden, and is transfixed by an enchanting sight:

Juliet on a sunlit bridge that spans the Ilam stream. She is wearing a shredded chiffon dress, with a Christmas tinsel crown and a necklace made from tinfoil. Sunlight filters through the trees, lending Juliet a magical quality. She's casting flowers onto the water. Pauline stands transfixed. Juliet sees her and smiles.

JULIET
Hi, Paul!

SUDDENLY! . . . an 8-year-old boy - JONATHON HULME - comes charging out of the bushes and lays into Juliet with a wooden sword. He is dressed in a "prince's" costume.

JULIET
0www!

Jonathon runs away. Juliet gives chase, yelling to Pauline.

JULIET
The evil Prince Runnymeade is escaping! Get him, Paul!

Pauline joins in the chase after Jonathon, careening through garden and bushes.

Juliet and Pauline lose sight of Jonathon. They pause in a clearing, catching their breath.

JULIET
The blighter's gone to ground!

JONATHON Yaaaa!

Jonathon drops from a tree, onto Pauline, sending, her sprawling. He whacks her on the bottom with his wooden sword.

JULIET
God! Jonty! Jonty-stop it! Go away! We're not playing anymore . . . go on, bugger off!

Jonathon pokes his tongue at Juliet, turns and runs away.

Juliet offers her hand and pulls Pauline up. She pauses, a look of shock on her face . . .

The Mario Lanza record lies broken on the ground. Pauline looks distraught.

HILDA They're egg and salmon sandwiches . . . I gave them to you several days ago.

HENRY I thought I could smell sulphur.

HILDA God, Henry! You're hopeless! You can't be trusted with something as simple as lunch.

JULIET
(O.S.) Mother!

Hilda looks up as Juliet bursts into the room from the garden, followed by Pauline. Hilda smiles at Pauline.

HILDA Hello . . .

JULIET
Jonty broke Paul's record!

HILDA Oh, dear!

JULIET
We must buy her another one!

Juliet drops to the floor, hauling records out of the radiogram cabinet.

Pauline looks around, taking in the sumptuousness of her surroundings: ornate fireplace, paintings, antique furniture.

HILDA Would you like a cup of tea . . . Paul?

PAULINE
No, thank you.

HILDA Well, Juliet's told us all about you. I hear you're fond of opera.

Before Pauline can reply, Juliet fans Mario Lanza albums across the floor.

JULIET
Which one shall we play?

Pauline shrugs awkwardly. Henry looks up from his papers, rather annoyed at this intrusion. Pauline notices a row of beautifully sculpted Plasticine horses adorning the mantelpiece.

Juliet puts a record on the turntable.

HILDA Juliet . . . your father's trying to study.

JULIET
Daddy can study while we're playing records!

HENRY Why don't you go back outside, mmm? I'll be finished soon.

The record drops on the turntable. The arm swings across.

Henry and Hilda glance at each other. Henry silently gathers up his papers and leaves the room.

Juliet collapses over Pauline's body, crying.

Pauline's eyes flick open! She sniffs and pulls a face.

PAULINE
Urrrgh! You've been eating onions.

Before Juliet has time to react, Pauline pushes her off, giggling maniacally. She leaps to her feet and attempts to run. Juliet grabs Pauline's cardigan, pulling her backwards.

JULIET
You toad!

Pauline sheds the cardigan and runs through the bushes, with Juliet in hot pursuit!

RRRRIP! . . . Juliet tugs at Pauline's blouse and the buttons pop off. Pauline is laughing too hard to run anymore. She pulls off her skirt and waves it around her head as she dances around the bushes, singing "The Donkey Serenade."

PAULINE
(Singing) "There's a light in her eye, Though she may try to hide it, She cannot deny, There's a light in her eye."

Now Juliet is cracking up at the sight of Pauline spinning around in her underwear, shoes and socks.

Pauline circles around and around Juliet, singing. Juliet hurriedly starts undressing down to her underwear.

Juliet giggles and starts jumping up and down.

Pauline holds James Mason's photo.

(Diary V.O.) Today Juliet and I discovered the key to the Fourth World. We have had it in our possession for about six months, but we only realised it on the day of the Death of Christ. We saw a gateway through the clouds. Everything was full of peace and bliss. We then realised we had the key . . .

INT. HULMES' CAR/COUNTRYSIDE - DAYAs Pauline's V.O. continues . . . CAMERA TRACKS IN SLOWLY, past Henry and Hilda, to a SHOT of Pauline and Juliet sitting quietly, staring ahead, blissfully.

PAULINE
(Diary V0.) We have an extra part of our brain which can appreciate the Fourth World. Only about 10 people have it. On two days every year we may use the key and look into that beautiful world which we have been lucky enough to be allowed to know of . . .

EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAYWIDE SHOT . . . the Hulmes' car, a small speck at the BOTTOM OF FRAME, winding over the hills.

PULL OUT . . . to reveal Juliet lying on her bed, in childbirth pose. Her pregnant stomach is pushing at the seams of her school dress.

Juliet wails . . . Pauline pulls out a pillow from between Juliet's legs, her face a mixture of surprise and elation.

PAULINE
It's a boy! Deborah . . . we've got a son and heir!

Pauline hands Juliet the pillow. She cradles it in her arms.

JULIET
I shall call him Diello.

PAULINE
You're such an incredible woman.

JULIET
I couldn't have done it without you, Charles.

The class titters . . . they clearly want to I STEVE 
ns s glare deters them.

Pauline sits at the back, smirking.

MRS. STEVE 
NS (Icy) Thank you, Juliet!

JULIET
. . . However, the Queen's biggest problem is her renegade child, Diello. He has proven to be an uncontrollable little brighter, who slaughters his nannies whenever the fancy takes him . . .

MRS. STEVE 
NS That's enough, Juliet!

Juliet stops and stands quietly. Mrs. STEVE 
ns rips the essay out of her hand and waves it under her nose.

MRS. STEVE 
NS I suppose this is your idea of a joke?

JULIET
No, Mrs. STEVE 
ns.

MRS. STEVE 
NS I suppose you think it's witty and clever to mock the Royal Family . . . to poke fun a the Empire, with this . . . rubbish!

Pauline leaps to her feet.

PAULINE
It's not rubbish!

MRS. STEVE 
NS Sit down, Pauline!

JULIET
I really don't understand why you are upset, Mrs. STEVE 
n. I merely wrote an essay on the Royal Family as requested.

Pauline points at the blackboard.

PAULINE
It doesn't say it has to be the Windsors!

MRS. STEVE 
NS (Yelling) Sit down!

Pauline sits down, looking victorious.

MRS. STEVE 
NS (To Juliet) A girl like you should be setting an example! To your seat!

Juliet starts coughing. Mrs. STEVE 
ns's face darkens.

MRS. STEVE 
NS Stop it, Juliet!

Juliet continues coughing. She sits heavily. Pauline snorts, trying not to laugh.

Juliet slumps over her desk, coughing . . . globules of blood splatter her exercise book.

Pauline's smile vanishes.

HONORA 
Come on, sit up.

PAULINE
I'm not hungry.

HONORA 
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.

PAULINE
I just want to be on my own for a while.

HONORA 
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.

HONORA 
You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!

HONORA 
holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.

PAULINE
Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?

HONORA 
Juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.

PAULINE
But she'll have no one to look after her!

Juliet tearfully shakes her head. Henry is standing at the foot of the bed, hands behind his back.

HENRY I'm sure you'll like it here . . . it's very tranquil.

HILDA I've spoken to the Matron, and she promises to take special care of you.

HENRY And you can carry on with your studies while you convalesce.

Hilda touches Juliet's hand, and leans forward . . . a concerned look on her face.

HONORA 
pops a couple more potatoes on Pauline's plate. HERBERT 
glances at Pauline.

HERBERT 
Thought I'd have a go at building the birdhouse on Saturday . . . anyone want to give me a hand?

Pauline remains silent.

HONORA 
You used to love making things with Dad, Yvonne.

MOVE IN . . . on Pauline, who has not been listening.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) This evening I had a brainwave: that Juliet and I should write to each other as Charles and Deborah.

INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE/PAULINE'S SLEEPOUT - NIGHTPauline is lying on her bed, furiously writing a letter.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) I wrote a six-page letter as Charles and a two-page letter as Paul.

INT. SANATORIUM - DAYJuliet lies on her bed, writing to Pauline.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) She has entered into the spirit of the thing greatly!

As we listen to Juliet's V.O., we see SCENES of TB hospital life . . . the meals brought around . . . the dayroom . . . the DOCTORS.

JULIET
(Letter V.O.) My dear Charles, I miss you and adore you in equal amounts and long for the day we will be reunited, but as I languish here, in this house of disease and decrepitude, my mind turns-with increasing frequency- to the problem of our son . . .

INT. SANATORIUM/JULIET'S ROOM - DAYJuliet sits at a desk. sculpting and painting a Plasticine figure of Diello.

As her V.O. continues . . . TRACK INTO a CLOSE-UP of Diello's fierce little face . . .

PAULINE
(Letter V.O.) My dearest darling Deborah. Affairs of state continue to occupy my time.

Pauline washes a pile of dishes in the kitchen.

PAULINE
(Letter V.O.) I have to report that the lower classes are terrifically dull.

Pauline is sitting in the lounge, looking very boring during a game of Lexicon with Herbert, John and a ROSS. Pauline is waiting for her turn, unaware that John is studying her from across the table. Her

word PUTRID spelled out.

PAULINE
(Letter V.O.) Only yesterday I was compelled to execute several peasants just to alleviate the boredom . . .

PAULINE
(Letter V.O.) . . . Diello insisted on coming along . . . in fact, he made such a fuss that I had to let him yield the ax himself. Heads did roll! Not just the prisoners, but the royal guard, my valet and several unfortunate copped it as well . . .

CUT TO:

INT. SANATORIUM/DAYROOM - DAYJuliet is sitting, writing in the sunny dayroom.

REVEREND NORRIS Hello again . . .

Juliet peers up at a DOG-COLLARED VICAR. She eyes him coldly.

REVEREND NORRIS How are you getting along? It must be awfully hard being away from your school chums . . . I've got something here you might just like to have a look at.

He hands Juliet a leaflet featuring a thin, withered figure in a great deal of pain. "JESUS LOVES YOU" is printed across the top.

Juliet's face hardens.

REVEREND NORRIS Unfortunately, modern medicine can only go so far in combatting an illness like TB. And that's why I'm here . . . because with the power of God, miracles can happen. The Lord has said that those who have faith will be saved! Reach out, Juliet! Reach out for Jesus!

During Reverend Norris's speech . . . CAMERA closes in to BIG CLOSE-UP of Juliet's face. Reverend Norris's voice fades away. . .

SUDDENLY!!!

A silhouetted figure rises up behind Reverend Norris . . . a lumpy hand closes around his throat!

HONORA 
Yvonne!

INT. SANATORIUM/DAY ROOM - DAYPauline rushes over to Juliet, who is seated by a window, knitting. They hug tightly.

JULIET
I'm so happy to see you!

HONORA 
hurries over.

HONORA 
It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit.

JULIET
Thank you so much!

Juliet sits back in her chair. She holds Pauline's hand. HONORA 
admires Juliet's knitting-a red cardigan.

HONORA 
That's coming along well!

JULIET
(Pleased) I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch!

PAULINE
I love the colour!

Juliet smiles at Pauline.

JULIET
It's for you.

Pauline squeezes Juliet's hand.

INT.JULIET'S ROOM - DAYHONORA 
is looking at some mail on a small table. Pauline is sitting at Juliet's bedside.

HONORA 
Goodness me! What a lot of letters. Are your parents enjoying their trip? Oh . . . there's a couple of unopened ones, dear.

JULIET
(Sarcastically) I'm saving them for a rainy day.

HONORA 
gives her a sympathetic look.

HONORA 
I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.

JULIET
(Bitterly) They sent me off to the Bahamas "for the good of my health." They sent me to the Bay of bloody Islands "for the good of my health."

HONORA 
looks startled at the outburst.

JULIET
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.

HONORA 
We don't want to tire you out, dear.

HONORA 
stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and Juliet grabs her hand.

JULIET
Can't you stay a bit longer, Paul?

Pauline looks at Honora.

We've got a tram to catch, Yvonne.

Pauline hugs Juliet and reluctantly takes her leave.

JOHN This is quite something . . . you're damn clever.

Pauline beams.

JOHN So . . . Deborah is married to Charles, and this chap Nicholas . . . is her tennis instructor?

PAULINE
Yes, but there's nothing between them. Deborah would never go for a commoner. Nicholas has got his eye on Gina, an amazingly beautiful gypsy.

She gestures to a Plasticine GINA figure that is sitting or the shelf.

JOHN Looks like you, Yvonne.

Pauline beams.

PAULINE
Juliet made it!

John smiles.

JOHN This is really quite incredible. l bet you girls know the entire royal lineage for the last five centuries.

PAULINE
Oh, yes! It's all worked out!

John returns Nicholas to the shelf, placing him amidst whole family of beautifully sculpted Plasticine figures. Pauline self-consciously returns to her sculpting, aware that John is watching her keenly.

EXT. SANATORIUM/GARDEN - DAYPauline is sitting cross-legged at the foot of Juliet's bed.

PAULINE

JULIET

PAULINE

JULIET
That idiot boarder?

Pauline beams.

JULIET
How do you know? Did he tell you?

PAULINE
Well . . . no. But it's so obvious.

Pauline giggles. Juliet turns away.

JULIET
(Sullen) Is that why you haven't replied to my last letter?

Pauline's smile disappears.

PAULINE
No, silly. I'm just teasing. He's only a stupid boy!

PAULINE
Whaddya want?

John puts his fingers to his lips to shush her.

JOHN (Whispers) l can't sleep . . . can l borrow a book?

PAULINE
(Whispers) Shut the door.

John tiptoes across to the bookshelf He pulls a book out . . . "Girls' Own Annual 1951."

JOHN This looks interesting.

Pauline gives him a dubious look from her bed.

John stands shivering, flicking through the annual.

JOHN These knitting patterns look damn complicated. Have you tried the tea cosy?

Pauline shakes her head and looks on as John continues to thumb awkwardly through the book, his shivers increasing.

He glances at Pauline nervously.

JOHN It's damn cold, isn't it? Do you think I could hop into bed for a moment . . . just to warm up? My feet are like iceblocks.

PAULINE
You should have worn your slippers.

JOHN Come on, Yvonne, I'll catch me death!

Pauline rolls to one side.

PAULINE
Just for a minute.

John climbs into bed beside Pauline and pulls the blankets up around his chin.

CUT TO:

PAULINE

PULL OUT during Pauline's V.O.... to reveal John lying in bed beside her. He cuddles up to her.

JOHN I love you, Yvonne.

Pauline continues, oblivious to his attentions.

PAULINE
And then in history, we've got this senile old bat, who goes . . . (Squawky voice) "And Charles the Second met Nell Gwynn aboard a boat and he was a prince and she was a pretty young thing and these thing do happen . . ." (Normal voice) God! It's no wonder I don't excel in history!

JOHN Do you love me as much as I love you?

PAULINE
0f course, my darling Nicholas.

John can't contain himself . . . he starts pressing himself against her body.

JOHN (Panting) My . . . my name's John.

Pauline lies on her back, not responding to his caresses.

PAULINE
I like Nicholas much better!

John climbs on top of Pauline.

JOHN You can call me anything you like . . .

PAULINE
What are you doing?

John scuttles out of the sleepout. Pauline lies still in bed, peering at her father.

HERBERT

seated around the table. The boarders are clearly oblivious to the tense family vibes.

LAURIE Coming to Lancaster Park on Saturday, Mr. Rieper?

HERBERT 
shakes his head, sullenly.

Wendy hurries into the room, grabs a piece of toast, pulling on a coat.

WENDY Where's John? He said he'd walk with me.

HONORA 
stands in the doorway.

HONORA 
John's no longer staying here.

Wendy looks surprised.

LAURIE Shot through, this morning . . . said his old Mum had taken sick.

INT. RIEPFRS' HOUSE/KITCHEN - MORNINGPauline is washing dishes, up to her elbows in soapy water. Behind her HONORA

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture.

HONORA 
(Angry) From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you.

Pauline bangs a dish into the rack.

HONORA 
(Angry) If you think for one minute that your father and I will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you've got another thing coming! You're only 14!!! You're a child! What on earth's the matter with you, Yvonne? You know what can happen with boys . . . Don't you have any self-respect?

HONORA 
sighs.

PAULINE
Can I go now?

HONORA 
grabs Pauline by the shoulders.

HONORA 
You think you're such a clever little madam! You had your father in tears last night!

Pauline flinches.

HONORA 
My God, what a disgrace you are! You shame me, you shame the family. You're nothing but a cheap little tart!

PAULINE
Well, I guess I take after you then!

HONORA 
whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.

PAULINE
You ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me!

HONORA

Footsteps approach . . .

Diello presses himself back into the corner . . .

Nicholas walks briskly. As he nears the portcullis, he espies something twinkling on the ground.

He reaches down . . . for a silver ring, set with a small pink stone. It is lying on the ground, as if dropped by somebody.

Diello slashes the rope with his dagger. Before Nicholas can react, the portcullis crashes down on him. His Plasticine body is crushed.

Nicholas's twitching fingers release the brooch. It falls to the ground and breaks. The pink stone pops out of its setting, rolls down the path and comes to rest by Pauline's and Juliet's feet.

INT. RIEPERS'HOUSE/HALLWAY - NIGHTHenry is standing on the Riepers' doorstep. Lightning flashes light up his face like something out of a gothic horror.

HENRY Mrs. Rieper . . . may I come in?

HONORA 
is standing, holding the door open, looking rather surprised at the unexpected visitor.

HONORA 
(Surprised) Yes, of course.

INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE/LOUNGE - NIGHTHenry and HONORA 
are sitting in the lounge. Henry looking rather uncomfortable on the edge of a shabby armchair. HERBERT 
is at a drinks cabinet unscrewing the top off a bottle.

HENRY Your daughter's . . . an imaginative and a spirited girl- HONORA 
If she's spending too much time at your house, you only need to say. All those nights she spends over-she's assured us that you don't mind . . .

HENRY It's rather more complicated than that. Since Mrs. Hulme and I have returned home, Juliet has been behaving in a rather disturbed manner . . . surliness, short temper . . . general irritability-most uncharacteristic.

HERBERT 
is pouring a drink.

HERBERT 
Sure I can't tempt you to a nice sherry, Dr. Hulme?

HENRY No, thank you. The thing is . . .

HONORA 
Yvonne hasn't been herself, either. Locking herself away in her room . . . endlessly writing.

HERBERT 
sits down next to Honora, glass of sherry in hand.

HENRY My wife and I feel the friendship is . . . unhealthy.

HERBERT 
No arguments there, Dr. Hulme! All that time inside working on those novels of theirs. They don't get fresh air or exercise!

HONORA 
frowns at Henry.

HONORA 
(Concerned) I'm not sure what you mean, Dr. Hulme.

Henry pauses for a moment.

HENRY Your daughter appears to have formed a rather . . . unwholesome attachment to Juliet.

HONORA 
(Worried) What's she done???

HENRY She hasn't done anything . . . it's the intensity of the friendship that concerns me. I think we should avert trouble before it starts.

Henry hands a business card to Honora.

HENRY Dr. Bennett is a very good friend. He's a general physician, but has some expertise in child psychology. If Pauline is indeed developing in a rather . . . er . . . wayward fashion, Dr. Bennett is the ideal man to set her back on track.

CUT TO:

INT. DR. BENNETT'S SURGERY - DAYPauline is slouched in a chair, looking very sullen.

DR. BENNETT (O.S.) What about your studies . . . are you enjoying school?

DR. BENNETT is seated behind his desk. Pauline is silent. She looks at the ceiling. HONORA 
is sitting next to Pauline.

DR. BENNETT Are you happy at home? Pauline is silent.

HONORA 
Answer Dr. Bennett, Yvonne.

Pauline remains silent.

HONORA 
(Annoyed) Yvonne!

DR. BENNETT Mrs. Rieper . . . perhaps you wouldn't mind waiting outside.

HONORA 
leaves the room.

DR. BENNETT Do you like your mother?

Pauline hesitates for a moment.

PAULINE
No.

DR. BENNETT And why is that?

PAULINE
She nags me.

DR. BENNETT And that's why you like to stay with the Hulmes?

Pauline looks wary. She doesn't answer.

DR. BENNETT Or is it because you want to be with Juliet?

No answer.

DR. BENNETT Do you . . . like girls?

PAULINE
No.

DR. BENNETT Why not?

PAULINE
They're silly.

DR. BENNETT But Juliet's not silly?

PAULINE
(Emphatic) No!

DR. BENNETT Yvonne . . . there's nothing wrong with having a close friend, but sometimes things can get . . . too friendly. Such associations can lead to trouble. It isn't good to have just one friend . . . my wife and I have several friend and we enjoy seeing them on a regular basis, and it's all perfectly healthy. Perhaps you could think about spending time with . . . boys- Dr. Bennett stops in mid-sentence, a look of surprise face. He looks down at his chest . . .

A red bloodstain is slowly spreading across his shirt. Dr. Bennett twitches slightly as the blade of a sword work its way out of his chest!

Pauline's face lights up as . . .

Diello rises up behind Dr. Bennett.

DIELLO (Orson Welles voice) Bloody fool!

CRASH CUT TO:

INT. DR. BENNETT'S WAITING ROOM - DAYThe surgery door opens and Pauline steps out, looking elated.

HONORA 
looks up from her chair.

Dr. Bennett appears in the doorway behind Pauline. He casts a wary glance in her direction.

DR. BENNETT Mrs. Rieper . . .

HONORA 
bustles in, and Dr. Bennett closes the door. Pauline sits down, folds her arms and stares blankly at a COUPLE OF SICK PATIENTS.

INT. DR. BENNETT'S SURGERY - DAYCLOSE-UP . . . Dr. Bennett's mouth.

DR. BENNETT Homosexuality . . .

HONORA 
looks horrified.

DR. BENNETT I agree, Mrs. Rieper, it's not a pleasant word. But let us not panic unduly. This condition is often a passing phase with girls of Yvonne's age.

HONORA 
But she's always been such a normal, happy child.

DR. BENNETT It can strike at any time, and adolescent are particularly vulnerable.

HONORA 
But what about the vomiting? She's lost a lot of weight . . .

Dr. Bennett shrugs.

DR. BENNETT Physically, I can find nothing wrong. I've checked for TB and she's clear. I can only attribute her weight loss to her mental disorder.

HONORA 
(Shocked) Oh . . .

DR. BENNETT Look, Mrs. Rieper . . . try not to worry too much. Yvonne's young and strong, and she's got a loving family behind her. Chances are she'll grow out of it. If not . . . well, medical science is progressing in leaps and bounds. There could be a breakthrough at any time!

INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE/HALLWAY - NIGHTSLOW TRACKING . . . down the hallway corridor. As the CAMERA passes doorways, we see the Riepers' family routine . . . HONORA 
in the kitchen. HERBERT 
wanders by and goes through the adjoining door into the lounge. He sits down and opens the paper. Wendy is attempting to t the fire. The family are chatting to each other, but we do not hear their conversation because . . .

. . . we are listening to Pauline's V.O.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) Mother woke me this morning and started lecturing me before I was properly awake, which I thought was somewhat unfair. She has brought up the worst possible threat now. She said that if my health did not prove I could never see the Hulmes again. The thought is too dreadful. Life would be unbearable without Deborah . . .

CAMERA CRANES UP . . . through the ceiling and into . . .

INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE/PAULINE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT. . . Pauline's bedroom. The room is filled with the sad strains of "E Lucevan le Stelle," an aria from Puccini's Tosca that is booming out from Pauline's portable record player.

CAMERA CRANES UP past the foot of the bed to reveal Pauline lying on her back, looking very morose.

TRACK IN TO her intense face as her V.O. continues . . .

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) l wish I could die. This is not an idle or temporary impulse. I have decided over the last two or three weeks that it would be the best thing that could happen together, and the thought of death is not fearsome.

CUT TO:

INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE/LOUNGE - CHRISTMAS DAY 1953CLOSE-UP . . . a Christmas present is torn open . . . followed by several more, in quick cuts. Typical 1953 presents.

Honora, Herbert, Wendy and Pauline are sitting on the floor, amidst presents and discarded wrapping paper. Grandma Parker is sitting in a chair.

HERBERT 
waves a pair of new socks around. The family laughing and talking. Pauline is not participating. She is leaning back, looking morose. HONORA 
looks at her with concern.

HONORA 
(Concerned) Is it hurting, dear?

Pauline looks blank.

HONORA 
Your leg . . . have you got pain?

Pauline shakes her head. She rips open a present . . . a new diary.

INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE/PAULINE'S BEDROOM - NIGHTCLOSE-UP of the Jan. 1st page. Pauline's pen starts to write . . .

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) My New Year's resolution is a far more selfish one than last year, so there is more probability of my keeping it. It is to make my motto: "Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow you may be dead."

Pauline looks up from her diary as the CAMERA RUSHES IN toward her face.

HONORA 
This arrived today, Yvonne . . .

Pauline looks at her mother with distaste.

PAULINE
My name is Gina!

HONORA 
It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.

PAULINE
What does old Stew want?

HONORA 
She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate.

PAULINE
Who cares!

HONORA 
I care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.

PAULINE
I'm educating myself!

HONORA 
You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE
I'm doing my own writing!

HONORA 
snatches up an exercise book from a large pile.

HONORA 
These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?

PAULINE
(Scornful) What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met!

HONORA 
is very angry.

HONORA 
You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.

PAULINE
(Shouting) I don't wanna be in bloody school!

HONORA 
(Shouting) All right! You go out there and get a job and you damn well pay your own way!

HONORA 
storms out of the room and slams the door.

Pauline's V.O. continues over . . .

A conversation between Henry and the two girls. The large lounge at Ilam is dark and cold. The mood is bleak.

MOVE IN . . . to EXTREME CLOSE-UP of Pauline's eyes.

HERBERT

exchange a glance.

HILDA I expect you've heard the same from your own daughter.

HONORA 
shakes her head.

HONORA 
(Upset) Yvonne hasn't spoken to me for nearly two weeks.

HILDA Yes . . . well, it hasn't been an easy time for any of us, Mrs. Rieper.

HERBERT 
She's cut us out of her life . . . it's been causing her mother and I a lot of worry.

HILDA What I'm suggesting is that we let the girls spend these last three weeks together. We'd like Pauline to come and stay with Juliet, until she leaves.

HERBERT 
Is that a good idea?

HERBERT 
looks at HONORA 
. . . tears are running down her cheeks. He stands and ushers Hilda toward the door.

HERBERT 
Why don't I telephone you tonight, Mrs. Hulme?

Mario Lanza's "The Loveliest Night of the Year" begins and continues over the next few scenes.

Pauline walks into the empty hallway . . . SUDDENLY!

Pauline's drab clothes transform into a ballgown as she passes through the doorway.

The song soars as they waltz into the middle of the ballroom . . . Pauline spins . . . in a blur she sees decorations and faces all around.

Pauline gasps as Diello takes her by the waist and waltzes around the room. Characters from Borovnia fill the room. Juliet dances with Charles.

A man in a dark suit turns around . . . MARIO! He launches into the second verse!

Pauline laughs happily as she is swept around and around.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) We realised why Deborah and I have such extraordinary telepathy and why people treat us and look at us the way they do. It is because we are MAD. We are both stark raving MAD!

They are no longer in the lounge - at some point the waltz has dissolved into . . .

EXT. BOROVNIA CASTLE COURTYARD - NIGHT. . . the courtyard in Borovnia Castle.

The crowds continue dancing to "The Loveliest Night of the Year."

A doorway in the courtyard . . . Henry Hulme is lurking in the shadows, peering out. He is dressed like a jester with cap and bells. The CAMERA PUSHES IN . . . to a distorted FISHEYE SHOT of Henry.

Pauline's V.O. continues, building in intensity . . .

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) Dr. Hulme is MAD, as MAD as a March hare!

At the conclusion of the song . . . TWO BURLY BOROVNIAN EXECUTIONERS swing their axes down, chopping a couple of ropes. A huge banner unfurls down the side of the castle tower. In embroidered letters three stories tall is the word . . .

MAD!

INT. CINEMA - NIGHTBANG! . . . a gunshot! CLOSE ON . . . Pauline's face flinching at the sound, a flash of light.

BANG! . . . CLOSE ON . . . Juliet flinching.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) It was the first time I had ever seen It. Deborah had always told me how hideous he was!

Pauline and Juliet are sitting in the cinema, absorbed in the film.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) It is appalling. He is dreadful. I have never in my life seen anything in the same category of hideousness . . . but I adore him!

CUT TO:

EXT. CHRISTCHURCH STREETS - NIGHTPauline and Juliet run along dark, damp, atmospheric streets.

Orson Welles steps out of the shadowy alley into the light. He leers at them. The girls scream! They turn to run, but Orson looms out of another alley.

Pauline and Juliet squeal and run about. PASSERSBY observe their antics with some alarm.

INT. ILAM/HALLWAY - NIGHTThe front door bursts open. Pauline and Juliet run in, still in a state of high excitement.

They charge up the stairs.

INT. ILAM/JULIET'S BEDROOM - NIGHTPauline and Juliet tumble into the bedroom, only to find Orson lurking behind the door! They scream and flee along the balcony only to be greeted by Orson at the other end! They run back into the bedroom and collapse onto the bed, screaming and giggling.

PUSH IN . . . to Pauline's exalted face.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) We talked for some time about It, getting ourselves more and more excited.

A huge shadow of a figure, dressed in hat and cape, rises on the bedroom wall behind the girls, threatening to engulf them.

MUSIC SWELLS UP . . .

Pauline comes down on top of Juliet, kissing her on the lips . . . Pauline's hands slipping Juliet's blouse off her shoulders.

CLOSE-UP . . . Diello swinging from side to side as he hacks a peasant to pieces.

INTERCUT WITH SHOTS of Pauline and Juliet intertwined with Orson and Diello. Pauline and Juliet sometimes change into their Plasticine counterparts, Deborah and Gina.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) We spent a hectic night going through the saints. It was wonderful! Heavenly! Beautiful! And ours! We felt satisfied indeed. We have now learned the peace of the thing called Bliss, the joy of the thing called Sin.

INT. ILAM/BATHROOM - NIGHTBATHWATER

Pauline and Juliet are soaking in opposite ends of a steaming bathtub.

A few moments silence. Juliet looks blankly at Pauline. A tear rolls down her cheek.

PAULINE
I'm coming with you.

JULIET
Yes . . .

PAULINE
I know what to do about mother.

Juliet's eyes narrow.

PAULINE

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) Our main idea for the day was to moider mother.

REVERSE ANGLE . . . Pauline and Juliet walk toward the house. Unicorns are grazing in the Ilam garden. Fairies dance in the air. Large dragonflies hover around the girls.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) This notion is not a new one but this time it is a definite plan which we intend to carry out. We have worked it out carefully and are both thrilled by the idea. Naturally we feel a trifle nervous, but the pleasure of anticipation is great.

EXT. ILAM GROUNDS - NIGHTCLOSE-UP . . . James Mason's photo lands in a roaring fire and is immediately consumed by the flames. Photos of Mel Ferrer, Michael Rennie and Orson Welles follow.

Pauline and Juliet are standing by a roaring fire in the Ilam grounds. They throw Mario records onto the flames. The black vinyl curls and melts. Their Plasticine figures are next. Globs of melted Plasticine drip amidst the burning debris.

It is clearly a strange, ritualistic burning. Pauline and Juliet watch the fire, enraptured.

JULIET
Only the best people fight against all obstacles . . .

Juliet squeezes Pauline's hand.

JULIET

INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE - DAYHONORA 
is bustling about the house, working. Every time she bends down, or leans over, Pauline is revealed behind her. She is helping, but the mood is one of a hunter closing in on its prey.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) I rose late and helped Mother vigorously this morning. Deborah rang and we decided to use a rock in a stocking rather than a sandbag. We discussed the moider fully. I feel very keyed up as though I were planning a surprise party. Mother has fallen in with everything beautifully and the happy event is to take place tomorrow afternoon. So next time I write in this diary Mother will be dead. How odd-yet how pleasing.

JULIET
I think she knows what's going to happen . . . she doesn't appear to bear us any grudge!

Pauline puts the brick in the stocking and ties a knot in the foot.

PAULINE
. . . but in the end I decided against it. I thought it would spoil all their fun.

A SERIES OF CARDS explains what happened subsequently:

In the hours following Honora's murder, a police search of the Rieper house unearthed Pauline's dairies. This resulted in her immediate arrest for the murder her mother.

Juliet was arrested and charged with murder the following day.

After Pauline's arrest it was discovered that Honor, HERBERT 
Rieper had never married. Pauline was therefore charged under her mother's maiden name of Parker.

In August 1954, a plea of insanity was rejected by the jury in the Christchurch Supreme Court trial and Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme were found guilty of murder.

Too young for the death penalty, they were sent to separate prisons to be 'Detained at Her Majesty's Pleasure.'

Juliet was released in November 1959 and immediately left New Zealand to join her mother overseas.

Pauline was released two weeks later, but remain New Zealand on parole until 1965.

It was a condition of their release that they never again.

Writing and Directing Heavenly Creatures

A Talk with Frances Walsh and Peter Jackson

Peter Jackson and Frances Walsh were both born and raised in Wellington, New Zealand. Jackson's first film, Bad Taste 1988), was made by the director over a period of several years while he was working as a photo apprentice at a local newspaper. Jackson's two following films, Meet the Feebles (1990) and Braindead (1992), were co-written with Walsh and Stephen Sinclair; the latter was a hit on the film festival circuit, winning 16 international prizes including a best picture award from the

Academy of Fantasy, Science Fiction and Horror.

Jackson and Walsh (who had previously written for episodic television in New Zealand) co-authored the screenplay for Heavenly Creatures, which went on to garner nominations for both an Academy Award and a Writers Guild Award. Their latest collaboration is The Frighteners, executive-produced

by Robert Zemeckis and starring Michael J. Fox; it will be released in 1996. Jackson and Walsh live in Wellington with their son, Billy.

The version of Heavenly Creatures published here is a final draft, completed in March 1993. The screenplay was 107 pages long.

Fran, my understanding is that you were the first to become interested in the Parker/Hulme murder case as a film subject. It seems to be a popular topic in New Zealand.

Frances Walsh: Well, popular topic-I'm not sure about that. But it's certainly a piece of New Zealand criminal history that has entered into the realm of myth. And as a young girl growing up, I knew about it, and had read lurid newspaper accounts- "Lesbian killers' rampage"?

FW: Yes, yes. And I also got my hands on a novel called Obsession, which I read when I was about 14. I thought at the time that it was extremely good. [laughs] It takes a very damning view of the girls-it's written by two English journalists who came out here to cover the trial. It was something of a hack job that set out to sensationalize the case.

And there was also a play, wasn't there?

FW: Yeah, there's been a play, and there have been nonfiction books written about it. There's also been a great deal of coverage over the years in newspapers and magazines, so it's always had a profile here.

Since it had already been treated in all of these different ways, what compelled you both to explore the subject again?

Peter Jackson: Well, we didn't really think it had been treated that well. Nothing that we had read did we particularly like. And also, the other various treatments all seemed to have a specific agenda, which attempted to make political statements about the murder. What interested us was to show these two 15-year-old girls with no other agenda than to be as accurate as we possibly could, and to somehow imagine what was going on inside their minds.

I know that all of Pauline's voiceovers from the film are from actual diary entries. You made an interesting comment awhile back about how they actually informed the structure of the film. Could you elaborate on that?

PJ: Well, the structure was fairly apparent once we started to do research. It wasn't just the diaries themselves, it was the general research. We read as much of the diaries as we could-we haven't actually ever seen the full, unedited diary-but we gathered as many of the excerpts that were releasedat the time of the trial as we could, which amounted to quite a few pages. And we read the newspapers, and interviewed people, and then the three acts sort of materialized quite neatly. You know, act one is when the two girls meet and become friends, and the turning point is at the end of the first act when you realize that they are now bonded.

FW: It's when they have their first delusional experience together at Port Levy, where they go into the Fourth World. You know these two girls have an imagination that's going to lead to something interesting happening. The second turning point comes with the decision to murder Mother, which tips

the story into the third act.

Whom did you interview to cull together all of this information?

PJ: Well, we went through about 35 or 40 people. We wanted to interview as many people as we could find. Several refused. We talk to about 15 or 16 of their classmates, which was experience. These were 55-year-old women spread out around the country, and they all had changed their names because they'd gotten married. It was quite a detective job to find them.

I read somewhere that the school was not particularly enthusiastic about this; did they help you locate the ex-students?

PJ: No, the school didn't want anything to do with it. Christchurch Girls' School had erased these two girls from their history. The yearbook that had the class photograph with Pauline is no longer available. If you go to the school library, they have all the yearbooks available apart from 1953's, which has her photo in it. It sort of cleansing of the books. The school didn't recognize what it was we were trying to do, which was to redress the issue. Why wipe these girls off the school records? I mean, they were human beings.

FW: Peter and Jim Booth, the producer of the movie, went to see the headmistress of the school, and after they explained what we wanted to do, and allowed her to read the script, her only comment was, "Why can't you make a film about pupils of whom we are proud?"

PJ: We also heard from several sources we interviewed that on the day after the murder happened, the headmistress at the time stood up in front of the assembly and said, "No girl is to discuss a certain matter." This was, like, the day after two of their pupils had murdered somebody, and they couldn't even refer to it directly. Forty years later, we got the sense that the school was exactly the same. And that really gave us all the more reason to make the movie, because we felt that these people were still

living in the 1950s. We found that with a lot of the people we interviewed-that even though 40 years had gone by, they were still presenting attitudes of the '50s: this was some dark, sordid little thingthat was best kept quiet and should never be mentioned. Many times we got, "Why on earth would you want to make a film about this?" We should just forget about it, and hope it will somehow disappear."

And we actually thought about doing that. But within 20 or 30 years most of the people connected with it will be dead, and at that point in time we'll never know anything about it. We felt it was a good time now, while there were still quite a few people alive, to do the interviews and try to get something accurate, for the record. We were also aware of the responsibility we had, because film is such a persuasive medium, and we knew that, unlike any other medium-the newspaper accounts, the play-itcan give an audience visual images, which, in a way, almost replace the real event, especially if you weren't born at that time. So we thought if we made a film now, perhaps people in New Zealand would look upon this case in a different way. That was a responsibility we felt that we didn't want to take lightly.

Pertaining to that quest for accuracy, how does one go about reconstructing, for instance, conversations between Pauline and her mother, or other scenes for which there is no direct documentation?

FW: Well, all you can do is attempt to find out as much as you can about the people involve-the type of people they were, their class background, etc. So to that degree, we spoke to people who knew the Riepers, for example, who had good knowledge of the girls.

Did you interview any of the boarders in the Rieper house?

PJ: Yeah, I did, very briefly. We found one of the boarders, who spoke to me on the telephone. I did the interview, and then the following day I called him back to ask him some more questions and he clammed up; he didn't want to talk to me anymore. He'd obviously gone home to his wife, and she'd

wound him up about the whole thing and told him he shouldn't be involved with it.

FW: I think our understanding when we set out to write this was that we would never be able to re-create the right interiors, with characters who precisely reflect the people who were really there. Our intention was to be true to what we understood of the girls' friendship, and the nature of that

friendship and the nature of those families from which those two girls came. It was never an attempt to re-create reality. We could never do that, obviously. So we went into those things with the spirit of trying to reflect the situation, rather than reality.

PJ: The Hulme family were a lot easier to research than Pauline's family, because the Hulmes were public figures at the time. Henry Hulme being the rector of the local university, there were obviously a lot of university people we could talk to professors, students-who worked with him. Hilda Hulme was also quite a public figure. They were, in some respects, the royalty of Christchurch, because the English class system was and still does exist down there, and they all take these things quite seriously.There used to be garden and tennis parties at Ilam, and there were a lot of people who had social contact with the parents and Juliet at the time.

The research actually carried on through the shooting of the film. I remember when we were in England, auditioning actresses for the part of Juliet before we found Kate Winslet, and we found out that [the late] Anthony Quayle, the English actor, had actually visited the Hulmes in Christchurch in the '50s, so we tracked down his wife and spoke with her. The research just kept on going all the time. We had trips to Christchurch to do our research, but once we started working on the film, we moved there

for nearly five months, so it was an ideal opportunity to find others. We'd hear things about this person who had sat next to Pauline in typing class, and we'd rush around to see them.

I'm sure the production got a certain amount of notice in the local media, so people probably approached you.

PJ: To an extent, but not as much as what we had hoped. Pauline's people were actually quite difficult to research, because they just weren't public; they were quite private people.

FW: We have heard, subsequently, that Pauline's sister, Wendy, has seen the film. She still lives in Christchurch. Her con meets were that the film managed to capture the atmosphere of her home at that time, but her criticism was that the family was "better" than that, we had portrayed them in too shabby a light. And that really touched me.

PJ: She thought that the portrayal of the tension between Pauline and her mother was very accurate. It was nice, because Wendy is one of the few key people alive who refuses to talk about it. She absolutely refuses to have anything to do with journalists, with anyone, so it was actually very sweet of her to get the message back to us. It was quite amazing to us that she had even gone to see this film. She thought it was good, but incredibly difficult to watch.

In gathering all of this material, I'm sure there were certain things that didn't "fit" dramatically. Was there anything you were tempted to use but didn't, because it was either too sensationalistic or too ethically questionable?

PJ: There was one area we deliberately steered clear of that we felt ultimately didn't have a relation to what we were wanting to tell, and that was that in the Rieper household there was actually a younger sister, named Rosemary, who had Down's syndrome, who is still alive; Wendy still looks after her. At the time of the murder, Rosemary was only 8 years old. This made Honora's life all the more difficult: the daughter lived in a special home, and would come home on the weekends. Pauline writes about Rosemary a lot in her diaries; she was very fond of her. But it was one area where we felt that we were being too invasive into the privacy of this family.

As you say, there was quite a bit of stuff we had to leave out for structural reasons. Pauline's diaries are very, very funny. We ended up using a lot of the more dramatic material in the movie, in the scenes in which she's talking about murder and suicide, but unfortunately we had to leave a lot of the funny things out. She records hilarious conversations that she and Juliet had, and it's all very witty.

Sometimes we used diary entries and just dramatized them, as opposed to using a voiceover. Like the sequence where they go into the Fourth World, where the hilltop changes into a magical landscape. That is described in detail in the diary. So it was a case of having to be very selective, and at the end of the day, it was the more dramatic selections that made it through to the movie rather than the funnier stuff.

The girls ' sense of humor does manage to come through in the film, though. I'm thinking, for instance, of the last scene in the Rieper house, when the family is having lunch with Juliet before the two girls and HONORA 
go to Victoria Park. Were their snide comments about Sir Edmund Hillary in the diary, or were they invented by the two of you?

FW: That was out of our imagination. We were told that they were extremely jolly at that last meal-it was actually in the court records-and that they were cracking jokes, and saying silly, outrageous things, on a sort of giggly high. And we knew that Wendy had worked at Farmer's, the localdepartment store, and also what had been very big in the news that year was Sir Edmund Hillary, a New Zealander, climbing Mt. Everest. He had been knighted, and became a huge national hero; he still is. Because he'd also spent time in Christchurch, we felt that this was an appropriate thing for

them to send up, because whatever they did, they were terribly irreverent. If the Queen was visiting, for example, they wouldn't bother to go out unless it was to take note of the decorations, the pomp and ceremony, to enrich one of their own royal celebrations. They really had no respect for the icons of the day; their interior world was much more important to them.

The film critic for Time, Richard Corliss, likened you to a "physician who assumes a patients fever in order to understand her illness." At what point did you two decide that this was going to have to be presented from the girls' point of view?

PJ: I think from the beginning. That was one of the motivations for doing it. None of the accounts we came across were from the girls' point of view. Like we'd said before, they all had other agendas, so we felt that telling the girls' story was important. It did take us a long time to be able to do that, because it took us a long time to learn who they were, and what was driving them. We were a bit confused-there was a bit of mystery at the beginning-but the more we read, the more we talked to people, we gradually began to formulate who these people were. Ultimately, there was a lot of Pauline that I could recognize in myself, which was very useful.

You, too, Fran?

FW: I felt that the diary: offered the first insight into the friendship, and into Pauline in particular. It was an extremely interesting account of her life, documenting both dramatic and mundane events with a great deal of literary flair. She was a very imaginative, funny and clever young woman who had some quite pretentious ideas, as teenagers do, and I warmed toward her immediately. Reading the diary made me wonder about the huge discrepancies between this young woman and the monster who was portrayed in the newspaper accounts and everything else. And I thought it would be great to take that journey to find out who she was. Because no diary of Juliet's survived-we have heard from people that she did keep a diary, but it was destroyed-I thought it would be harder to get to know her, but that really wasn't the case, because she appeared to be someone who more readily shared her life with people; she was much more of a social creature than Pauline. So it was a combination of the private world that they shared and the understanding that we got from talking to their school friends, inparticular, that gave us insight into the nature of these two girls and the way they appeared to the rest of the world.

I think it's fair to say that both Peter and I felt hugely sympathetic toward Pauline and Juliet, and we did start to identify and empathize with them, all the while trying to keep in balance the knowledge of this terrible act. It was that dynamic, of really liking them, but feeling abhorrence at what they'd done, that kept the thing alive for so long in our minds, and gave the film inner life.

Peter, your camera work, in all of the films you've directed, is extremely dynamic. In 'Heavenly Creatures,' the almost hyperactive camera seems to have an organic relationship to the girls' euphoric state. I've noticed in this script that a lot of these camera directions are written in, with more detail than most other screenplays I've read. Do all of your scripts read like this?

PJ: In this particular screenplay, camera movement came quite readily during the writing stages. At the end of the day, the script is not the document we want to go out and sell; it's the document that the cast and crew have to read. When we write a script intended for me to direct, it's right from the beginning a shooting script; a document for technicians to use. You know, the grips put a circle around the word "DOLLY" so they remember on that particular day of shooting they're going to have to have it on the truck. With this movie, probably more than any other I've done, the camera moves were integral to the scriptwriting. I'll tell you where that came from: the music. We read very early in our research that Pauline and Juliet were both obsessed with Mario Lanza. Neither of us were familiar with his music, so we went out and got some of his records, and before we started writing we played through them and came across several songs that we really liked. One of the very first ones we heard was "The Donkey

Serenade"- FW: Well, we knew that was important to them because Pauline had named one of her novels "The Donkey Serenade."

PJ: When we heard it, just the life and vitality in the song immediately indicated Steadicam. [laughs] It immediately told you you had to have a moving camera. We chose all the songs that were in the movie, and, in the case of "The Donkey Serenade," wrote scenes around them. I found it a great visual tool. It's never happened before in anything I've done-I mean, I've never had the music in advance. We had these songs playing while we were working to get ourselves psyched up to write a scene. At the same time, the music helped me visualize, so that visualization ended up going down on the page. Of course, once you actually arrive on the set, and you have the actors and the camera people there, things can change. I don't regard anything that's written into a script in terms of a camera direction asbeing locked in stone.

How long did it take the two of you to finish a first draft?

PJ: Not really long. I think the first draft was written in probably 10 or 12 weeks. But we didn't start to write until we'd uncovered several months' worth of research.

And the draft we're publishing is the shooting script?

PJ: Yeah. I think that's about draft number five. We did an interesting thing. We did a certain amount of research first, while we were still working on Braindead [Dead Alive in U.S.], and then we wrote the first

draft from the position where we felt we knew some of the facts, but there were a lot of gaps. We thought if we wrote a draft we would know where the holes were, and we would know what we had to pursue in terms of research. For instance, Fran and I had never been down to Christchurch when we wrote this first draft, and Christchurch is such an integral part of the story. Then we made the trip down there before the second draft and were able to modify a lot of things, interview lot more people. We actually did that on purpose, because we wanted to nail the story before overlaying it with a lot of historical detail.

How do the two of you handle writing collaboratively?

PJ: Well, it depends. You know, if Fran's working on some re-writes while we're shooting, and I'm on the set, she'll show me some work that she's done when I come home and we'll revise it together, but generally, when we're actually writing the initial drafts of the script, it's always together.

I think that we both have a good understanding of structure, which helps, and I'm obviously very visually oriented, and Fran is very good on dialogue and character, so we complement each other quite well. I think the best advantage that we have in writing scripts together is that we write a script that I go and make, which is, I think, a wonderful thing. It would be a strange experience for us to write a script that someone else was going to make, because we've never actually experienced that loss of control that so many other writers have. So right from the very beginning, it's a movie. It's not a piece of writing that's going to go out to the marketplace and may or may not sell.

Just one little thing. Even though Heavenly Creatures was very much written by the two of us, my favorite scene in the movie was written by Fran by herself.

Which one is that?

PJ: Well, it was late one night, and we were hoping to finish the first draft of the script-it was, like, ten o'clock already-and we had arrived at the sequence in the tearooms where they're having their last cup of tea before they walk down the track. We sat there wondering how on earth we were going to write this scene. We knew they'd actually gone there to have tea because we'd spoken to this very elderly woman who had served them. She said they were talking quite calmly to one another. But what dialogue do you put in their mouths at this particular moment, when this woman's about to be murdered? Well, the phone rang, and I got up to answer it and ended up stuck on this call for about 45 minutes, and I came back and Fran had written something. She asked me to check it out, and it was never revised: it's where she slides the plate with the last cake over to Honora, and says, "Go on, Mother, treat yourself." It was perfect.

I know you found Kate Winslet at an audition in England. How did you come across Melanie Lynskey, who played Pauline? I understand she was not a professional actress.

PJ: Well, it's one of those stories that sounds like it's not true. We wanted to cast someone in New Zealand, and we'd auditioned a lot of people-five or six hundred-who were either videotaped or photographed. I wanted to find someone who was young, around 1S or 16 years old; I didn't want a 23-year-old in a school uniform. And we wanted someone who was physically very much like the original Pauline; I have a thing about being as accurate as possible. So we quickly exhausted the professional actors in New Zealand who happened to look like Pauline-there's only about one or two. [laughs] We knew we were looking for someone with no experience, but we just had to find them. We kept saying, "Somewhere in New Zealand there's somebody who's perfect for this role."We were actually about four weeks away from beginning shooting, and we had one or two people on the short list, neither of whom we were happy with, but we were coming under enormous pressure to cast one of them, because, you know, the wardrobe department needed to make costumes, and so

on, and Fran said to me, "You're not really happy with the choices, are you?" And I said, "No." And she said, "This is crazy; we've spent all this time and energy on this film and we haven't found Pauline. This is something close to a major tragedy." I was in Christchurch, so Fran decided to drive with a casting person around the lower half of the North Island of New Zealand-she was prepared to drive as far as she had to. They'd visit every small town, go to the local school, visit the principal's office and show a photo of Pauline Parker. She'd say, "We're making a movie about Pauline Parker; do you have any pupils in your school who resemble her who might be interested in this?"

FW: We were in a rusting Ford Cortina, and we had no official I.D. We'd roll up to these provincial schools, and we'd be greeted by some curious teacher. Although no one ever once questioned our authenticity, we would always get asked about the car: "If you're in films, why aren't you driving

a Porsche?" [both laugh] So then I would pitch the story to the entire classroom, scanning the room the whole time, looking for sullen, brooding school girls, all the while thinking, "What would she look like with her hair dyed black?"

PJ: I guess that went on for about a week. Every night I'd get a call from Fran. Anyone that was vaguely appropriate was videotaped, and I got a couple of tapes in Christchurch, and it was a bit depressing. Finally, Fran called from a small town called New Plymouth, and said, "I think I've found someone very interesting. ' And this was Mel. We flew her down to Christchurch and gave her an audition and a screen test, and we cast her two weeks before the film started shooting. I called her mother up on a Friday night and said, "I'd really like Melanie to do the film." And she said, "When does she have to start?" And I said, "Well, she's got to come down here on Sunday." The poor girl didn't even get a chance to go back to school to clean out her locker.

Do you think there was any correspondence between the two actresses and their backgrounds and those of the characters they were playing?

PJ: One of the things that we knew about Pauline was that she was incredibly witty and intelligent, and Melanie was very similar-she was the top student in her province in many subjects. And we knew if we cast an intelligent person, then they were going to hit it. Melanie's also very enigmatic. The character of Pauline doesn't have an enormous amount of dialogue. In a sense, the real Pauline Parker speaks for her, through the diaries. So what we were looking for was an actress who has that kind of aspect to her that's a real movie-star thing: where you can film somebody sitting in a room, doing nothing, and they're still fascinating to watch. We found that in Mel.

I've read that you used actual locations for some of this.

PJ: As much as we could. The only location we couldn't use was Pauline's house, which had been torn down. Fortunately, the school is now a community center; the actual school moved to a different location, so they no longer had control over the buildings; otherwise we'd have definitely been refused

permission. The school buildings are now owned by the Christchurch City Council, which has done nothing to them; they're as they were 40 years ago. They just rent out the various rooms to community groups. We found out what classroom Pauline and Juliet actually were in, and it was the Canterbury

Women's Embroidery Guild-it sounds like something out of Monty Python-and we went into the room and right down one length of the wall was this huge tapestry that had been stretched out on this massive frame. I thought they would never want to take it down, but we managed to get them to do it. So that was the actual classroom where they were, down to the seating.The Ilam house, where Juliet lived, is still there. It's owned by the university, and they were very happy for us to use it. As for the doctor's surgery, where Pauline is interviewed by the doctor, we found out the address, and-you know, this is 40 years later, so you have no idea what to expect-it was just, like, a suburban house. We thought that was strange, in that it didn't seem like a doctor's office. Anyway, we knocked on the door, and the woman who answered happened to be the doctor's daughter-the doctor's long since dead-and we asked her where her father's office had been, and she said, "Oh, he had rooms out the back of the house here; we've never really touched them." We went into this doctor's surgery which was almost exactly the same as it had been 40 years before. So we ended up filming those sequences in the actual room where Pauline was interviewed by the doctor.We also spoke to the woman who was working at the tearooms at Victoria Park and found out exactly where they sitting, and filmed that scene there. Actually, about two months later, that building was demolished.

And what about the murder scene?

PJ: Well, we went to the murder site, and we just felt uncomfortable about filming there. It was very strange, and maybe it was just our imagination, but it was very quiet, very tranquil. I mean, all the way down the path you hear the wind and the birds, and suddenly, when you arrive at the spot, you hear nothing. So we filmed the murder scene at Victoria Park, but it was on a different track, about a hundred yards away.

There is one sequence of scenes in this script which didn't appear in the film. it begins with the tennis party at Ilam, in which Pauline and Juliet are watching from behind some shrubbery as Walter Perry and Hilda Hulme play tennis.

PJ: Well, that sequence was actually shot, and exists in the version of the film that was screened here in New Zealand. When Miramax released the film in the U.S., they had screenings and felt that the film was too long. We had final control over the film, but they pleaded with us to take out about 10 minutes' worth of footage, convinced that it would be tighter. We looked at it, and we actually, ultimately, agreed with them in a funny sort of way. That sequence slows the momentum down. It's quite a fun one to

read-and it's fun in the film as well-but it does slow things down at a point where we didn't think things should be slowing down. Although we've had control over the film's release all over the world, we've requested that the sequence be cut out of the versions screened in every other country. When you're writing a script, a part of you thinks, "Oh, this is perfect, we mustn't change a word of it," but once it's finished it takes a life of its own. We felt that the sequence wasn't telling us anything wedidn't already know about the characters, and at a time where the tension in Pauline's house was really growing, going over to Juliet's house to watch a tennis game was not necessary.

FW: I think when we wrote the script we felt it was very much Pauline and Juliet's story. After the edit, however, it became very evident to us that it was Pauline's story which was the through line and the audience's focal point. Whenever we veered too much into telling the Hulme story and Pauline wasn't on the screen, the pace started to flag. That was something we had to look at after the first assembly-we had to trim and cut Hulme scenes because they weren't as fundamentally interesting as the Rieper scenes.

Although this film is very different from Braindead, both take place in the New Zealand of the 1950s. I'm not that familiar with your country, but from watching these two films I would have to assume that it was, at least in that period, a fairly repressive kind of society, acting almost as a breeding ground for transgression, for explosive kinds of behavior.

PJ: Well, the script for Braindead was set in the modern day up until the very last minute. I was worried going into the movie that the hero of the film, named Lionel, acted in a fairly nerdy kind of way-he doesn't socialize, he takes care of his mother-and yet we wanted him to be the empathetic character in the film. I was afraid that if it was set in the modern day, the audience-especially a young audience-would really jeer at this character, and not be able to relate to him at all. If we set it inthe '50s, people might actually feel more sympathy for him, because they would think, "Well, that sort of thing happened then." With Heavenly Creatures, it was really just a coincidence that the actual event had taken place then.

FW: But that repression is still very much in evidence here: we're I not expressive, we're not demonstrative, we're scared of showing, saying too much. When you go to New York, for instance, and people are yelling and the horns are blaring-if that happened here, someone would get out of theircar, rip open your door and bash you up. There's a level of violence, a subtext of violence, running through New Zealand society that comes out in our movies. We have a veneer of being easygoing, but underneath, we're full of rage. It's an interesting social dynamic. and it makes for interesting art, but it's not so pleasant to actually live in it. It's very much to do with a link with England- PJ: Christchurch in particular.

FW: Christchurch suffers from it more than any other city in New Zealand. It's always been described as "a little piece England"; it's considered to be more English than England. It's always aspired to be that, and it still is in some ways.

PJ: The thing with this murder, too, is that the sense you when you talk to the older generation in Christchurch is that it was an embarrassment to the city, that it was somehow shameful and somehow humiliating. Which is ridiculous, because the story is ultimately a family tragedy.

FW: It's been said that Christchurch was more appalled by revelation that Pauline's parents were not married than by the murder itself. And some uncharitable souls even suggested that one sinful act led on to the other.

Speaking generally about your films, you both seem to have a certain love of campiness, which is apparent in the use of caricatures for many characters, as well as in an overall sort of extremism reminiscent of the work of someone like John Waters here in the U.S. What's interesting about Heavenly Creatures is that while it remains a fundamentally "realistic" docudrama, some of the figures of authority, like the doctor, the vicar and the headmistress, are hilariously overplayed.

PJ: Well, I like movies to be entertaining, to be a little larger than life. With something like Braindead, obviously there's no problem doing that. But with 'Heavenly Creatures,' we were telling what we hoped would be a fairly accurate story. At the same time, however, I still wanted to make a movie; I didn't want something totally tied to real life, and totally dull. So we did have a little bit of fun with some of those characters. I guess if you were trying to justify it you could say we were presenting them from the girls' point of view, but that's not strictly true. I just think that there were really only two people who we needed to be realistic with, and they were Juliet and Pauline, both of whom were slightly larger than life anyway. That's something that came across in the interviews with their classmates. They were remembered as being sort of terrifying: Juliet was so confident and loud, and Pauline was brooding and dark. So, in a sense, the film was a perfect one for us. I don't Like doing stuff that's totally naturalistic. I just like having a little bit of fun.

The fantasy sequences are written pretty much as they appeared on film. Were you aware of how, technically, you were going to handle these special effects as you were writing?

PJ: Pretty much. We hadn't used any optical or digital effects in Braindead, and with Heavenly Creatures, I knew that if I actually wrote digital effects into the script, then it was a great excuse to go out and get this new equipment-I have my own special effects company. So right at the beginning we wrote stuff that could only be done with morphing. We got one computer and hired someone to figure out how it all worked.

What about your use of the Plasticine figures? Was that something you'd heard the girls were interested in?

PJ: Yeah, we interviewed several people who remembered that they used to model figures in Plasticine, and I think HERBERT 
Rieper refers to it in his court testimony. We also interviewed an old guy who had been round to the Hulme's place and had seen Juliet's Plasticine horses on the mantelpiece.

And, of course, there are endless passages in the diaries about Borovnia, and Diello, the murderous prince and all of that. When we thought it would be fun right at the beginning to go into some of these fantasy sequences, the last thing I wanted to do was dress up actors in medieval costumes and

crowns and have them looking like something out of a school play. So we decided it would be really fun to tie the Plasticine figures and Borovnia together. And we knew they'd sculpted figures like Diello, so we just thought, why not have those figures come to life, as it were.

What about the linking of certain actors to certain figures, like Orson Welles to Diello?

PJ: Well, that was something that we devised ourselves. But again, that springs from the fact that the girls used to give pet names to people. Like one of the boarders in the diary, for instance, is referred to as John for a while, and then his name changed to Nicholas.

That's referred to in the scene in Pauline's sleepout.

PJ: Yeah, and for some reason, Pauline refers to him as Nicholas in the rest of her diary. That happened with a lot of people. They were clearly using real, live people as prototypes for some of their fantasy characters. We figured that Diello had a lot of qualities that they seemed to fear in Orson Welles. He seemed to represent some sort of dark, sexual force, so we figured that giving his features to the figure of Diello was appropriate.

Could you talk about the fact that, during production, Anne Perry, the mystery writer, was "outed " as being Juliet Hulme?

FW: Well, where do you start? We knew that would be a possible outcome of making this film-that someone might try and track down either Pauline or Juliet. Which was a very good reason not to make the movie. We had more compelling reasons to make the film, however, because if we didn't, anotherone was going to get made anyway. There were, at the time the film was being funded, five competing projects in various states of preparation.

Didn't Dustin Hoffman have something in the works?

FW: His company, Punch Productions, I believe, had a script written by an American writer; Peter had, in fact, been very tentatively approached to read it, that was how we found out about it. At that point we were about a week away from starting to shoot. And then someone was trying to do a film version of the play we've already spoken of, and other people were developing a very politicized lesbian version of the story. Then there'd been a screenplay written by the late English novelist, Angela Carter, that was with a production company in Auckland, and there was someone in Australia developing a screenplay. So we knew that this story was going to come to the screen, soon-there was no doubt someone was going to make it. And we felt that, in that climate, we would proceed, despite the possibility that these women might be exposed.We knew that in Pauline's case it was less likely. We'd heard a lot of rumor and gossip about Juliet, but we'd heard nothing about Pauline, and I think she has very carefully hidden her identity. Juliet went to no such trouble: she took her stepfather's name-Hilda Hulme ended up marrying Walter Perry-as a novelist, and proceeded to write a series of crime novels. You can look up any contemporary author index in any library, and there is Anne Perry, and her birthdate is the same as Juliet Hulme's, her mother's maiden name is the same, etc. There is a gap in her personal history, where she leaves out New Zealand, but it picks up again after she left the country. So it didn't take a huge amount of detective work from the journalist here in New Zealand who had heard that Anne Perry and JulietHulme were one and the same.

That rumor sprang from a production of the play that had gone on here a year before we started shooting, where a friend of Juliet's, who was still writing to her, confided in one of the actors that Juliet Hulme was now writing murder mysteries as Anne Perry. That rumor hew around the acting community here in New Zealand, and it reached our ears on the set, and it was something that we wanted to entirely disassociate ourselves from, because we knew it would damage the film, and we knew it would damage us. It was inevitable that we would be accused of exploiting this woman's situation in order to promote the movie. When this journalist rang Peter and asked what comment he had about the story, he just begged her not to print it. Of course that was a hopeless situation, because she was a tabloid hack who was going to go ahead and make her name, and she has dined off it ever since. We felt an enormous amount of dread, because the movie hadn't had a chance to stand on its own before this was made known, and it's now been inextricably linked with this revelation. So we've been battling that ever since. But given that it's happened, we've had to deal with it, as she has.

PJ: I mean, we were absolutely disgusted by some of the ads Miramax ran. On the day that this was released in America, I rang Miramax and said, "For heaven's sake, don't associate this film with any of this because we don't approve of this publicity." And a couple of months later, lo and behold, we

get sent by a friend in the States clippings with these ads saying, "Murder, She Wrote," and these other references to Anne Perry that Miramax had been running, and we were just very, very angry.

Did you fever consider using the coordinates of the actual event, but changing enough of the particulars to push it into the fictional realm?

PJ: No, because the case is so well-known in New Zealand; it would be like-

FW: Fictionalizing the O.J. Simpson case.

PJ: It's unnecessary. I mean, sure, if it was just a movie for international consumption, then, yeah. But the fact is that we weren't actually making this film for an international audience. We were very much

making it to try and rectify 40 years of misunderstanding about this case within New Zealand. In a way that was our main motivation for making the film, and in doing that, we obviously had to use their real names. But having said that, "Pauline Parker" and "Juliet Hulme" ceased to exist as people in 1959, because they both took different names. In a sense, I don't think there was any moral problem with using those names, because they themselves stopped using them some 30-odd years ago.

Were there any other films you looked at as inspiration before writing this?

FW: Well, we looked at movies like Let Him Have It, which was based on the Craig/Bentley murder case in England [Bentley was an 18-year-old with a low I.Q. who was hanged for murder]. Although I think that film has quite a lot of merit, in the end it comes across as a grim, dark, true-life murder

story, and similarly Dance with a Stranger, which was about Ruth Ellis [the last woman to be hanged in England]. We felt that if there was one thing we didn't want to do, it was to make a depressing murder film. We really wanted to tell a tale of a friendship, rather than a murder story. Sure, the movie ends with a murder, but for the most part, it celebrates friendship.

PJ: We wanted to make it a lot funnier than those films. And people have said, "It's such a serious subject; why did you try to make it funny?" Well, obviously the murder wasn't funny, and we never attempted to make it funny, but the friendship was funny. Life is funny: generally, human beings

like to enjoy themselves, and there was no doubt that Pauline and Juliet had a hell of a good time, most of the time.

FW: But the other reason why it was important that we tell this as a true story is that it has a kind of universal truth for anybody growing up. When you're at that age, you become very focused on things in an extreme way. And I don't think Pauline and Juliet are so very different from anybody else; I think several things went wrong in their lives-Juliet's parents broke up, and Pauline became very alienated from her family (she was an obsessional manic-depressive character)-and I think it was this terriblecombination of things that led to this extraordinarily horrible act. But it's not something that can be precluded from anybody's experience in growing up. Adolescence is such a crazy time.

PJ: A lot of women have come up to us and said, "I was Pauline. That was me. That was my childhood." I don't think it's that unusual. I think what is unusual about the whole thing is that these aspects of Pauline's character led to the murder, and I don't think the sort of person she was was particularly unusual or freakish or weird. When we hear things like that, it's the best possible endorsement we could get.

         arrogance that hurts, it's the money.

                        BLANE
         Yeah?    What were you gonna do with the money?

                      PINCUS

                      BLANE
              (SHRUGS SHOULDERS)
         Hey, I vote we do...

                      MOORE
         ...put you down like the fucken dog you
         are... you gonna come, shoot your way to
         stardom? Don't do any...

                         BELLA
         ...I only

                      MOORE
         I don't want you to do anything unless and
         until... we hit the City, ditch the car.

                         BELLA
         ...I'll...

                      MOORE
         You do it, you do it.
              (PAUSE)
         You do it, Pinky...

                                                                 40.


HE WIPES HIS HAND OVER HIS MOUSTACHE.    TAKES OFF HIS HARDHAT, AND
WIPES THE SWEAT FROM HIS BROW.

INT BOAT REPAIR SHOP NIGHT

A SPRAY OF SPARKS FROM A WELDING UNIT.

ANGLE

ON MOORE, AS HE PUTS UP THE SHIELD ON A WELDER'S MASK, WIPES HIS
BROW, PUTS THE SHIELD DOWN AGAIN, AND CONTINUES CUTTING WITH AN
ACETYLENE TORCH ON A LARGE, INDUSTRIAL AIR-CONDITIONING UNIT.

ANGLE

IN THE B.G. A RYDER RENTAL TRUCK.

ANGLE.   ON PINCUS AND BLANE, AS A LONG ASSEMBLY TABLE.

BLANE HOLDS A LEGAL PAD, AND IS MAKING NOTATIONS ON IT.

HE SPEAKS TO PINCUS, AS CAMERA PANS OVER THE TABLE, HOLDING ON
BLANE'S HANDS AS HE CHECKS THE VARIOUS PROPS.

WE SEE: A SECURITY GUARD'S UNIFORM. A LEATHER BADGECASE, HOLDING
A GOLD BADGE, SEVERAL SMALL METAL CANNISTERS, A TOOLKIT, A UTILITY
BELT HOLDING TOOLS. SEVERAL WALKIE TALKIES.

PINCUS AND BLANE CONVERSE, V.O.

                       PINCUS
          The thing of it is, the thing of it is, it's
          a question of redistribution...

                        BLANE
          How's that?

                       PINCUS
          The question: how do we get the money from
          there to here... it's just a question in
          logistics.

                       BLANE
          "What is the robbing of a bank, compared with
          the founding of a bank?"

                       PINCUS
          Who said that?

                       BLANE
          Anybody ever applied for a loan.

ANGLE

ON THE TWO, AS BLANE HANDS THE CLIPBOARD TO PINCUS.

                       PINCUS (cont'd)
          ...load it up?

                                                                  41.


BLANE NODS. THEY BEGIN HAULING THESE PROPS AND SUPPLIES INTO THE
TRUCK, AND LOADING THEM INTO THE "FALSE" (HOLLOW) ENGINE.

BLANE LOOKS OUT OF THE BACK OF THE TRUCK.

ANGLE, HIS POV.   A CAR PULLS UP OUTSIDE THE SHED.   BELLA GETS OUT.

ANGLE

ON BELLA, AS HE WALKS INTO THE SHED.   HE TAKES OUT AN ENVELOPE.

ANGLE, ON BLANE, WHO OPENS THE ENVELOPE.    TO REVEAL CASH INSIDE.

                      BELLA
         ...expenses for the truck, and...

                      BLANE
         Yeah, I got it. I got it.     Okay.

BELLA WALKS OFF, AS FRAN ENTERS FROM THE "LIVING" AREA OF THE
BOATSHED, HOLDING TWO CUPS OF COFFEE.

FRAN STARTS TO OPEN HER MOUTH, SMILING, AS HE STARTS TO PUT DOWN
THE CUP OF COFFEE, MOORE GIVES HER AN INFINITESSIMAL SHAKE OF HER
HEAD. AND MOTIONS TOWARD BELLA. FRAN NODS IN AGREEMENT, AND, NOT
BREAKING HER STRIDE, WALKS TOWARD BELLA.

                      BELLA
              (TO FRAN)
         Well, then...

                      FRAN
         ...that's right.
              (PAUSE)

                      BELLA
         ...long time.
              (PAUSE)

                      FRAN
         ...that's right.

ANGLE

ON MOORE, LOOKING AT THEM.

ANGLE, HIS POV:

BELLA AND FRAN, IN THE B.G., BELLA CHATTING FRAN UP.

ANGLE

ON BLANE AS HE WALKS OVER TO MOORE, AT THE WELDING STATION.     HE
HANDS MOORE THE ENVELOPE.

                      BLANE
         The plan gonna work?

                                                               42.


                      MOORE
         It's gonna work if we make it work.   How's
         Fran doing?

                      BLANE
         Looks like he maybe wantsa take her to the
         Prom.

MOORE SMILES, AND NODS.

                      MOORE
         Well, it's always the pretty girl stays
         home, innit?

                      BLANE
         Izzat what they said in the White
         Community...?

                      MOORE
         That's what I hear.

                      BLANE
         And I hear, if you get a goose, it keeps the
         fox off the chickens.
              (LOOKS AT FRAN AND BELLA)
         What does that lady see in you, by the way?

                      MOORE
         I'm very resilient.

                      BLANE
         Yeah, so's Gumby.

                      MOORE
         I got a more striking profile.

PINCUS WALKS UP.   HE AND BLANE WALK ACROSS THE SHOP FLOOR, BLANE
LIMPS SLIGHTLY.

                      BLANE
         They're gonna leave that on the cutting room
         floor, Buenos Aires.

                      MOORE
         I never liked the way I looked anyway...

                      PINCUS
              (AS HE LOOKS OVER HIS SHOULDER AT
               FRAN AND BELLA, SOTTO)
         ...seems to be coming along nicely.

                      BLANE
              (SOTTO)
         My boy there, like to Fertilize the Flowers.

                      PINCUS
         ...how's your leg?

                                                                43.


                      BLANE
         You should see the other guy...

                      PINCUS
              (TO MOORE)
         ...when we do the switch, the Highway...

MOORE SHAKES HIS HEAD, INDICATING BELLA.

                      PINCUS (cont'd)
         ...he can't hear...

                      MOORE
         ...he can't hear what you don't say...

                      PINCUS
         I'm gonna be as quier as an ant pissing on
         cotton.

MOORE FIRES UP THE TORCH, AND BEGINS CUTTING AGAIN.

ANGLE, IN THE B.G. FRAN AND BELLA.

BLANE WALKS PINCUS AWAY FROM MOORE.

                      BLANE
              (SOTTO)
         Don't think it, Baby. Don't think it: Don't
         be as quiet as an ant pissing on cotton, don't be
         quiet as an ant thinking about pissing on
         cotton. You be quiet as an ant not even
         thinking about pissing on cotton.

THEIR WALK TAKES THEM TO BELLA AND FRAN.    FRAN IS LAUGHING.

                      FRAN
         ...our friend was telling me "What Made Him a
         Criminal..."

                      BLANE
         I'll get the beer and pretzels.

                      BELLA
         ...what made you a criminal?

                      BLANE
         Nobody made me a criminal.     I am a Criminal.

MOORE WALKS OVER.

                      MOORE
         How we doing?

HE GATHERS THEM AROUND A TABLE.

                      BLANE
         How you doing?

                                                               44.


                       MOORE
          I'm done.
               (PAUSE)
          Well, that's it them.

MOORE GETS UP, CAMERA TAKES HIM TO THE RYDER TRUCK. HE OPENS THE
BACK, AND WE SEE HIM OPEN WHAT APPEARS TO BE THE SOLID MOTOR, WHICH
IS REVEALED TO BE HINGED AND HOLLOW.

BLANE FOLLOWS HIM, AND HANDS HIM SEVERAL FIREARMS, WHICH HE
SECRETS IN THE HOLLOW SPACE.

                       MOORE (cont'd)
          You got the detonators?

BELLA HOLDS UP SEVERAL PUTTY COLORED PACKAGES OF PLASTIQUE, WHICH HE
TAKES OFF OF THE TABLE, BEARING THE PROPS.

                       BELLA
          ...din we check'em?

                       MOORE
          I know we checked'em. What I'm doing, I'm.
          I'm asking you a question.

                       BELLA
          What happened to Check It an Forget it?

                       MOORE
          Yeah, well, I went to the Other camp, which
          is Fuss it to Death, and Fuck it into a
          Cocked Hat, or do you want to run the
          show...?

PAUSE.   THEY EXCHANGE A LOOK.

BELLA WALKS AWAY SHAKING HIS HEAD.

                       BLANE
          Then we ready to Go Do it?

                       PINCUS
          I'm ready to go do it, you know why? I never
          liked the Swiss in any case. You know
          why? They make those little clocks, two
          cocksuckers come out of them, little
          hammers, hit each other on the head.
               (PAUSE)
          What kind of sick mentality is that?

ANGLE, ON BLANE AND BELLA, AS BELLA LOOKS OVER AT MOORE.

ANGLE.   ON BELLA, AS HE WALKS OVER TO FRAN.

THEY BOTH LOOK BACK AT MOORE, WHO IS LOADING UP THE TRUCK.

                       BELLA
          Z'he gonna hold up?

                                                              45.


                      FRAN
         Why would you put a man in a position, he's
         got no way out?

                      BELLA
         What is that, your philosophy?

                      FRAN
         That's right.

                      BELLA
         ...what is it to you?

                      FRAN
         ...he's my Husband.

                      BELLA
         Whose fault is that, you wanna think about
         it? Listen:...

                        MOORE
                (IN THE B.G.)
         I...

ANGLE, ON BELLA, AS HE TURNS.

                      BELLA
         ...you gonna make an Impassioned Speech?

                        MOORE
         Yeah:    Let's go get the money.

                      BLANE
              (TO BELLA AND PINCUS)
         You clean the place down, n'y'thing'll burn,
         burn it..., nobody's coming back here, nothing
         that we need, don't leave it f'somebody else.

PINCUS LIGHTS A FIRE IN A 55 GALLON DRUM.

ANGLE, ON MOORE, AS HE WALKS TO THE FRONT OF THE SHED, AND LOOKS
OUT AT HIS BOAT.

FRAN COMES UP BEHIND HIM.

                      FRAN
         Z'it gonna work?

                      MOORE
         It's either gonna be a monumental heist, or a
         real amusing anecdote.
              (PAUSE)

                      FRAN
         ...I love you, Joe...

                        MOORE
         Why?

                                                              46.


                      FRAN
         You know why? Because you're thorough.

                      MOORE
         I hope to tell you...

SHE TURNS TO WALK BACK INTO THE SHED. HE TURNS TO LOOK AT HER.
IN THE B.G. WE SEE PINCUS FEEDING PAPERS INTO THE FLAMES.

ANGLE. EXT THE BOATSHED, ON THE GROUP, BLANE MOORE, PINCUS AND
BELLA, AS THEY WALK TOWARD THEIR CARS.

PINCUS IS ON THE PHONE IN THE B.G. (ON A CELLPHONE)

MOORE STOPS TO LOOK AT HIS BOAT.

                      BELLA
         You gonna miss it?

                        MOORE
         What?

                        BELLA
         Your boat?

                      MOORE
         Well, it's a nice boat.

                      BELLA
         Hey, baby, after this job, you're gone have
         enough money, make this look like a Boat inna
         Bathtub.

                      MOORE
         That's right.

PINCUS GOES TOWARD MOORE EXCITEDLY.

                      MOORE (cont'd)
         ...what is it?

                      PINCUS
         ...they found the car.

                        MOORE
         ...what car?

                      PINCUS
         ...the car we used at the Overpass. The cops
         found it, I heard it on the police band.

                      MOORE
         ...they found it, how'd they find it?    I tole
         you to it? I tole
         you to ditch it in...

                      MOORE
         Did you wipe it down...?

                      BLANE
         You sonofabitch, what do you mean, you stopped
         off to see your...

                      MOORE
         Did you wipe it down...?

         ...what does this do to the Job...?

                      BLANE
         Man, you din't wipe it down, they're gonna
         be on you, they're gonna be on all of us...

         The job stands...

                      PINCUS
         ...I'm sorry, Joe.

                      MOORE
         Shut up. The job stands.
              (HE LOOKS AROUND)
         This joint is burnt.

                      BLANE
              (TO BELLA)
         Come with me...

                      MOORE
         Meet at the Overpass.

                      BELLA
         ...the job stands...?

                      MOORE
         The meet at the overpass.   The 14th...

                       PINCUS
         Joe.   Joey, I...

                      MOORE

                      PINCUS
         ...I don't see how they could of found the
         car...

BLANE STARTS MOVING BELLA OVER TO A CAR.

                                                               48.


                       BELLA
               (AS HE GETS INTO A CAR)
          You go on...

WE SEE BELLA AND BLANE, IN TWO SEPARATE CARS, BEGIN TO DRIVE OFF.
WE SEE MOORE, IN FOREGROUND, BEGIN TO WALK BACK TOWARD THE
BOATSHED, AND PINCUS, IMPLORING, HANGING ON HIS ARM.

ANGLE, TIGHT ON PINCUS AND MOORE.

                       PINCUS
          Joe. Joe, I swear to God.      I swear to God,
          I... are they gone...?

                       MOORE
               (LOOKS OVER PINCUS SHOULDER)
          They're gone.

                       PINCUS
          Well, then, you get gone, too.

                       MOORE
          ...that's right.

BEAT.   THEY EMBRACE.

MOORE TAKES OUT THE MONEY ENVELOPE.

                       PINCUS
          You take care, Pally.

                       MOORE
          You get his cut to Bobby...?
               (PINCUS NODS)

                       PINCUS
          You gonna be Okay?

                       MOORE
          I'm okay now.

                       PINCUS
               (OF THE ENVELOPE)
          Yeah? What do you do for cash?

                       MOORE
          ...we're taking down the Boat guy.

                       PINCUS
          You're taking down the boat guy...

                       MOORE
          That's right.

           Well, no, but as Rational Men, don't we
           have to "doubt" her?

                        BELLA
           She thinks the guy's weak, he's scared, she's
           scared, I think she's sincere.

                      BERGMAN (cont'd)
         Where's the gold?

                      MOORE
         Where would you like it to be...?

BERGMAN GESTURES TO THE THUGS, WHO TAKE HOLD OF MOORE'S ARMS.
MOORE LOOKS AROUND WILDLY AT THE DESERTED PIER. BERGMAN ADVANCES
ON MOORE, HOLDING THE KNIFE.

                      BERGMAN
         What is it, with your pal...?

AS BERGMAN NEARS MOORE, MOORE TURNS, BREAKING THE HOLD OF THE TWO
MEN. HE HITS ONE IN THE THROAT, KICKS AT THE OTHER, AND STARTS
TO RUN. ONE OF THE THUGS PULLS A PISTOL, AND SHOOTS AT MOORE, AND
MOORE FALLS TO THE PIER, GRASPING HIS SHOULDER, HE GETS SLOWLY UP,
AND FACES BERGMAN, AND THE THUGS, WHO STAND ON THE PIER ALONGSIDE
THE SAILBOAT. MOORE LOOKS AROUND.

                        BERGMAN (cont'd)
         And then   where is he now. Your  running buddy?
         No, It's   all over, and I need to know:
         Where Is   The Gold. I hate to do  anything as
         dramatic   as "counting to Three," but... ONE:
                        (MORE)

                                                                  120.


                      BERGMAN (cont'd)
              (HE HOLDS OUT HIS HAND. A
               HENCHMAN PUTS A PISTOL INTO IT.)

AS HE SPEAKS, MOORE KEEPS TURNING, SO THAT THE SUN IS BEHIND
MOORE, AND SHINING INTO THE EYES OF BERGMAN AND HIS ACCOMPLICES,
WHO NOW STAND WITH THEIR BACKS TO THE BOAT.

                      BERGMAN (cont'd)
         Two... why must you, oh, God, why in the
         world must you, why in the hell, a guy like
         you, would you put me in a position... Aahh,
         the Hell with it, life is too short, you
         know what? Fuck you...

HE RAISES HIS ARM TO FIRE. BEHIND HIM WE SEE BLANE EMERGE FROM THE
SAILLOCKER ON THE BOAT'S DECK, BLANE HOLDS A SHOTGUN. HE SHOOTS
BERGMAN AND THE TWO THUGS, ONE OF THE THUGS TURNS AND FIRES AT
BLANE, WHO IS WOUNDED. BLANE FIRES AGAIN AT THE THUG, AND STUMBLES
ON TO THE PIER, AND FALLS BACKWARD INTO THE WATER BETWEEN THE BOAT
AND THE PIER.

ANGLE

ON MOORE, WHO MOVES JERKILY,     TO THE SIDE OF THE PIER. HE TRIES
TO PUSH THE BOAT AWAY, TO GET     TO BLANE IN THE WATER. HE UNTIES
THE LINE WHICH HOLDS THE BOAT     TO THE PIER, AND PUSHES THE BOAT
AWAY. HE THROWS THE LINE TO      BLANE, WHO USES IT TO LIFT HIMSELF UP
ONTO THE PIER.

THE TWO MEN SIT FOR A MOMENT, CATCHING THEIR BREATH.

                      MOORE
         How you doing?

                         BLANE
         I'm leaking?
              (PAUSE)
         You hurt?

MOORE NODS. HE STANDS, AND HELPS BLANE TO HIS FEET. MOORE PICKS
UP THE SHOTGUN. THEY LOOK AROUND, BEHIND THEM, THE SAILBOAT IS
DRIFTING OUT TO SEA.

THEY START DOWN THE PIER. STEPPING OVER ONE OF THE BODIES OF THE
THUGS. THE SECOND THUG LOOKS UP.

                         THUG
              (WEAKLY)
         I... I...

BLANE KICKS HIS BODY OVER THE SIDE OF THE PIER, INTO THE WATER.

MOORE STEPS OVER THE DYING BERGMAN.

                       BERGMAN
         Cute.   Very cute.

MOORE WALKS OVER HIS BODY, AND HE AND BLANE CONTINUE DOWN THE
PIER.

                                                                  121.


                      BERGMAN (cont'd)
         Don't you want to hear my dying words...?

MOORE TAKES THE SHOTGUN FROM BLANE, AND STEPS BACK TO BERGMAN.

                       MOORE
         I just did.

HE SHOOTS BERGMAN, HANDS THE SHOTGUN BACK TO BLANE, AND THE TWO
HEAD OFF, HELPING EACH OTHER DOWN THE PIER.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

INT INDUSTRIAL DINER. DAY.

MOORE, HIS ARM IN A SLING, NOW WEARING A BEARD, SITTING IN A BOOTH,
DRINKING COFFEE.

                       BLANE
              (VO)
         I hear...

MOORE LOOKS UP, BLANE, WALKING WITH A CANE, SLIDES INTO THE BOOTH
OPPOSITE HIM.

                      BLANE (cont'd)
         I hear if you put milk into it, it lesses the
         chance of stomach distress.

                      MOORE
         Hey, you can't worry about every little
         thing...

THEY BOTH SIT, LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW.

A WAITRESS COMES BY WITH A COFFEEPOT.

                       WAITRESS
         Heat it up?

                      MOORE
              (AS HE RISES)
         No, I think we gotta be moving on.

ANGLE EXT THE DINER, AS THE TWO WALK ACROSS AN INDUSTRIAL AREA.

                      BLANE
         Too bad about Pinky.

                      MOORE
         Ain't that so.

                      BLANE
         ...always made me laugh.

                                                              122.


                      MOORE
         Well, what more can you say of anyone?

                      BLANE
         Nothing...

BEAT. THEY CONTINUE WALKING ACROSS THE STREET TO REVEAL THEY ARE IN
THE INDUSTRIAL AREA OUTSIDE THE BOXING GYM. THERE ARE MANY KIDS
PLAYING IN THE STREET.

                      BLANE (cont'd)
         Robert the Bruce...

                      MOORE
         Yeah?

                      BLANE
         Why'd they call him Robert "The" Bruce...

                      MOORE
         ...what?

                      BLANE
         Why'd they call him Robert "The" Bruce?
              (PAUSE)

                      MOORE
         Because he asked them to.

BLANE NODS.

                      BLANE
         Y'go to that Plastic Surgeon, don't lettem put
         you all the way under. I knew a guy in
         Statesville, went to get his face fixed, woke
         up, sucker'd given him a pair of tits.

                      MOORE
         Yeah, that's no bargain.

                      BLANE
         Well, he landed back inside, he never had to
         want for Cigarettes...

BLANE TAKES OUT A SLIP OF PAPER, AND HANDS IT TO MOORE.   MOORE LOOKS
AT IT.

                      MOORE
         Send your cut there...?

                      BLANE
         Wire it there, when you get where you're
         going.

                      MOORE
         That I will, Pal.

                                                                123.


                      BLANE
         I hear it's nice down there in the Sun.

                      MOORE
         Zat where I'm going?

                      BLANE
         Wherever it is, Brother, don't come back.
              (BEAT. MOORE NODS.)

BLANE EMBRACES MOORE. BEAT. BLANE HANDS HIM THE KEY TO THE
GARAGE. AND WALKS OFF. WE SEE BLANE WALK ACROSS THE STREET, A
CONVERTIBLE PULLS UP, DRIVEN BY A VERY BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN. BLANE
GETS INTO THE PASSENGER SEAT AND MOTIONS HER TO DRIVE.

ANGLE C.U. MOORE LOOKING ON.

ANGLE: HIS POV, ON BLANE'S CAR, AS IT DRIVES OFF, BLANE TURNS BACK
TO LOOK AT MOORE ONE LAST TIME, THEN SHRUGS AND TURNS FORWARD.

ANGLE, ON MOORE, AS HE WALKS ACROSS THE STREET, TURNS A CORNER AND
STANDS BEFORE A GARAGE DOOR.

MOORE USES THE KEY AND OPENS A SMALL DOOR SET INTO THE OVERHEAD
DOORS OF THE GARAGE. HE ENTERS THE DARK GARAGE.

ANGLE INT THE GARAGE.

A NEWISH TRUCK, WITH A LARGE ENGINE LASHED ONTO ITS BED. THE ENGINE
IS PAINTED IN FRESH BLACK PAINT. BEHIND IT, THE OLD BATTERED PICKUP
TRUCK, UP ON A JACK, ITS BED FULL OF THE RUSTED PIPES OF THE
DISCARDED BOXING EQUIPMENT, AND THE OLD ROTTEN LEATHER "HEAVYBAG."
MOORE TAKES OUT A PACK OF CIGARETTES AND A LIGHTER, HE IS ABOUT TO
LIGHT A CIGARETTE, WHEN HE LOOKS OVER AT THE NEW TRUCK.

HE PUTS THE CIGARETTES DOWN ON THE OLD TRUCK, BENDS   DOWN, AND PICKS
UP A CAN OF BLACK PAINT. HE WALKS TO THE NEW TRUCK    AND APPLIES
TOUCHUP PAINT TO THE ENGINE LASHED IN THE BACK. HE    NODS AT IT,
AND THEN, SATISFIED, HE TAKES A TARP AND COVERS THE   ENGINE.

HE GETS INTO THE NEW PICKUP TRUCK AND STARTS IT.

WHILE IT WARMS UP HE GOES TO THE FRONT OF THE GARAGE, WIPING THE
BLACK PAINT OFF OF HIS HANDS WITH A RAG. HE RAISES THE SHED DOOR,
TO REVEAL FRAN STANDING THERE.

HE SMILES AND KISSES HER AND TAKES HER BACK TOWARD THE NEW PICKUP
TRUCK. HE OPENS THE PASSENGER DOOR.

                      MOORE
         Yeah, I knew you'd show.

                      FRAN
         Good, good plan, baby...

                      MOORE
         Yeah, I wouldn't clear my throat, without a
         backup plan...

                                                              124.


                      FRAN
         That's the right way to do it.

                      MOORE
         End of the day, though, end of the day,
         what's the important thing...?

                      FRAN
         That's right.

                      MOORE
         What's the important thing...?
              (PAUSE)

                      FRAN
         Shame about Pinky...

                      MOORE
         You heard.
              (OF TRUCK)
         Come on, get in.

                      FRAN
         Y'all loaded up?

HE LIFTS THE TARP TO REVEAL THE ENGINE, COATED IN BLACK PAINT,
SITTING THERE. HE RECOVERS IT.

                      MOORE
         C'mon, get in, we'll talk on the road.     You
         heard about Pinky...

                       FRAN
         Yeah.   I heard. I'm sorry about that.

                      MOORE
         Yeah, well, it just went bad there, that
         little bit. Dinnit...?

                        FRAN
         Yes, It did.

MOORE TOUCHES THE BRUISE ON HIS HEAD.

                      MOORE
         ...yes, it did... it got kind of convincing.

                      FRAN
         ...and, so, you got hurt.

                      MOORE
         Well, you can't do it halfway, can you...?

                      FRAN
         No, anything you do, you got to do full-out.
         Don't you?

                                                               125.


                      MOORE
         Indeed you do.

                      FRAN
         And, sometimes...
              (PAUSE)

                      MOORE
              (TOUCHES HIS FOREHEAD, AND THE
               BRUISE, WINCES)
         Then, that's just the Price.

                      FRAN
         That's right. That's what you taught me.
         That's part of it.

                      MOORE
         Well, but didn't you do great. Played it down
         to the last recorded syllable...

                      FRAN
         I went to a good school.

                      MOORE
         Never seen it done n'y better.   You hotwalked
         that dude so good.

                      FRAN
         ...thank you, Joe.

                      MOORE
         Cooled him out the livelong day.   You made it
         look so real.

HE MOVES TO THE FRONT OF THE SHED. AND TURNS OUT THE LIGHTS.    HE
WALKS BACK TOWARD FRAN, WHO IS STANDING AT THE TRUCK.

                      MOORE (cont'd)
              (TO HIMSELF)
         ...yes, you did.

                      FRAN
         Well, you know...
              (PAUSE)

                      MOORE
         ...what d'you mean, "that's part of it?"

                      FRAN
         I don't get you?

                      MOORE
         I was talking about Pinky.

                     FRAN
         Uh huh.

                                                                  126.


                      MOORE
         I said we paid the price.         And you said.   We
         paid part of it.
              (PAUSE)

                        FRAN
         Yes.    That's right.

                      MOORE
         ...what's the rest of it...?
              (PAUSE)
         What's the rest of it...?

ANGLE XCU MOORE.   AS HE LOOKS AT FRAN.

ANGLE

FRAN, AS SHE LOOKS BEYOND MOORE.

ANGLE ON MOORE AS HE TURNS.       BELLA IS STANDING BEHIND HIM.

BELLA HOLDS A PISTOL. HE MOVES TO MOORE, AND HE FRISKS HIM, AND
FINDS NOTHING, AND TAKES A STEP AWAY.

ANGLE, ON MOORE, AS HE LOOKS FROM BELLA TO FRAN.

                          MOORE (cont'd)

                (PAUSE)
         Oh.

BELLA LOOKS AT THE TRUCK.     HE LOOKS INQUIRINGLY, AT FRAN.

                      FRAN
              (TO MOORE)
         It was dead, anyway.
              (PAUSE)
         You know it was.

              (TO BELLA)
         ...it's in the back.

BELLA WALKS TO THE BACK OF THE TARP, RAISES A CORNER, LOOKS IN.

HE LOOKS AT HIS HANDS, AND TAKES OUT A HANDKERCHIEF, AND WIPES OFF
THE BLACK PAINT. HE LOWERS THE TARP DOWN.

                      MOORE
              (OF BELLA)
         Why dun' he shoot me?

                      FRAN
         Cause it's over. It's all done.    That's the
         deal.

         He ain't gonna shoot me?

         No.

         Then he hadn't aughta point a gun at me.
              (PAUSE)
         It's insincere...

MOORE SITS DOWN ON AN UNOPENED WOODEN BOX, IN THE DOORWAY OF THE
GARAGE.

         It was a pretty plan, though, wunnit...?

                      FRAN
         ...the best laid plans of mice and men...

                        MOORE
         ...what?

                      FRAN
         I said Nobody's Perfect.
              (PAUSE)
         You take care.
              (TO BELLA)
         Alright, let's go.

THE TRUCK DRIVES OFF.

ANGLE

ON MOORE, AS HE SLOWLY SHAKES HIS HEAD.   HE SIGHS.   HE WALKS BACK
INTO THE SHED.

                                                               129.


HE WALKS TO THE OLD ABANDONED PICKUP, WHERE HE LEFT HIS CIGARETTES
AND LIGHTER. HE TAKES OUT A CIGARETTE, AND HOLDS IT TO HIS LIPS.
HE HESITATES. HE CRUMBLES IT, AND THROWS IT TO THE FLOOR. LOWERS
THE PICKUP TO THE GROUND, USING THE HYDRAULIC JACK.

HE SIGHS, AND SLAMS THE TAILGATE ON THE OLD METAL FRAME OF THE
BOXING EQUIPMENT. THE TAILGATE DOES NOT CLOSE. HE SLAMS IT AGAIN.
AND IT CLOSES.

HE WALKS OVER AND GETS IN THE CAB OF THE OLD PICKUP.

ANGLE

THE OLD METAL FRAME IN THE BED OF THE PICKUP TRUCK. WE SEE THAT THE
TAILGATE HAS JAMMED ONTO THE OLD METAL PIPES, AND THE PIPE'S PAINT
HAS CHIPPED TO REVEAL THAT THE PIPE IS GOLD, AND WE SEE, ON
THE BASE OF THE PIPE, WHERE THE PAINT HAS CHIPPED, FAINTLY, THE
LETTERS CREDIT INTERNATIONAL DE GENEVE.

ANGLE

ON MOORE, IN THE TRUCK, AS IT PULLS OUT OF THE GARAGE.

                                                         FADE OUT.

          INT. TOLL BOOTH - DAWN

          A LONE TOLL BOOTH ATTENDANT sits inside his glass box on
          an empty stretch of interstate.
          This is HENRY.
          He looks out at the horizon. It's starting to get light
          out. There's snow on the ground.
          He's neither asleep nor awake.

                         

          INT. TOLL BOOTH - MOMENTS LATER

          HENRY'S PLASTIC GLOVES unscrew a THERMOS, pour coffee
          into a Styrofoam cup. There are only a few drops left.

                         A CAR
          Approaches. Henry straightens, slides open his window.
          But the CAR veers over to the automated EZ-PASS LANE...
          Henry closes the window, watches the car disappear. He
          downs the last of his coffee, looks back out at the
          horizon again.
          It's cloudy out there.

                         A CLOCK
          flips to 6:00.

                         

          INT. TOLL BOOTH - LATER

          Henry packs up his thermos, puts on his coat and steps
          out into the icy morning.
          He walks toward his truck. The traffic is beginning to
          build.

                         

          EXT. BUFFALO STREET - MORNING

          Henry's old FORD PICK-UP drives past the enormous,
          abandoned CENTRAL TRAIN TERMINAL.

                         

          EXT. BUFFALO STREET - MORNING

          The pick-up turns down toward a neighborhood of modest
          salt-box houses.

                         

          EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE - MORNING

          Henry's truck rolls into his driveway.

           2.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. HENRY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

          Henry enters. Hangs up his down jacket on a row of hooks.
          It's clean and ordinary in here.
          His wife, DEBBIE, is in the kitchen. She's wearing a
          NURSES uniform. Henry notices the dining room table set
          for one for breakfast. Eggs, bacon, sausage. He's a
          little surprised. Debbie appears. Lays down the toast.

                          HENRY
           Smells good.

                          DEBBIE
           Sit down.
          He sits. She smiles. Starts buttering the toast.

                          HENRY
           Wow. Thanks.
          He digs in.

                          DEBBIE
           How was your night?

                          HENRY
           Good. How was yours?
          She's still buttering the toast. Carefully.

                          DEBBIE
           Good.
          She sets it down.

                          HENRY
           This is great.
          She sits down next to him. Watches him eat.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           Your shift's at eight thirty?
          She nods.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           You not eating?

                          DEBBIE
           I already did.
          He takes another bite.

                          HENRY
           You okay?

           3.

                         

                         
          Pause.

                          DEBBIE
           Are you coming with me to Cindy and
           Bill's on Saturday?

                          HENRY
           Sure. What time?
          Pause.

                          DEBBIE
           For the baby shower.

                          HENRY
           Right.
          She just stares at him...

                          DEBBIE
           Well, I don't want to go to Cindy and
           Bill's.

                          HENRY
           What?

                          DEBBIE
           I mean I want Cindy and Bill to come
           here.

                          HENRY
           Cindy and Bill are welcome here anytime.
          Pause.

                          DEBBIE
           Henry. Isn't it time...isn't it time for us?
          Henry stops eating.

                          HENRY
           You're talking about kids.

                          DEBBIE
           Of course I am.

                          HENRY
           Okay.

                          DEBBIE
           'Okay' you want kids?
          Pause.

                          HENRY
           I love kids.
          He looks down, resumes eating. A beat.

           4.

                         

                         

                          DEBBIE
           Henry?
          He looks up again.

                          DEBBIE (CONT'D)
           Do you still love me?
          He's still as a stone.

                          HENRY
           Of course I do.
          She looks at him.

                          DEBBIE
           Because I know you did once.
          A very long pause. Henry doesn't do anything now.
          She's crestfallen.

                          DEBBIE (CONT'D)
           What happened, Henry?
          He just sits.

          THE FRONT DOORBELL RINGS
          Henry gets up, heads to the door.
          Debbie watches him go...

                         

          EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

          Outside on the step there are TWO MEN in SOFTBALL
          UNIFORMS. One of them is puking. Behind them TWO more
          GUYS sit in the back of the car.
          Henry recognizes the smiling, pock-marked face of EDDIE
          VIBES. Two parts charm, one part menace. His puking
          friend is JOE.

                          EDDIE
           Henry Torne.

                          HENRY
           Eddie Vibes.

                          EDDIE
           So how you doin', man?

                          HENRY
           I'm okay. What's going on?

                          EDDIE
           Listen, I got a man down here.

           5.

                         

                         
          Eddie glances up and down the street.

                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           Mind if we come in for a second?

                         

          INT. HENRY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

          Eddie and Henry watch while Debbie attends to the sick
          JOE, bits of puke still clinging to his softball uniform.
          She touches his forehead.

                          DEBBIE
           He's hot.
          He starts to retch.

                          JOE
           (holding it in)
           I'm sorry.

                          DEBBIE
           You better come with me.
          Eddie glances at Henry as Debbie leads him expertly
          toward the bathroom.

                          EDDIE
           Goddamn sausage at Pinwheels.

                          HENRY
           Yeah.

                          EDDIE
           So we're in a little bind, Henry. Got
           league playoffs in a half-hour and Joe's
           our first baseman. And he's not exactly
           game-ready as you can see...

                          HENRY
           Yeah.
          Eddie stares at him. Smiles.

                          EDDIE
           So, what do you say?

                          HENRY
           What do I say what?

                          EDDIE
           You feel like playing a little ball?
           Filling in for Joe?

                          HENRY
           It's November.

           6.

                         

                         

                          EDDIE
           Yeah. They keep the field in perfect
           shape.

                          HENRY
           Oh.
          Beat.

                          EDDIE
           So what do you say?
          Henry looks around the room. For a moment he watches
          Debbie with Joe in the bathroom, the door half open.
          She's tending to him, caring for him...
          Debbie looks up. Sees Henry staring at her.

                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           Henry?

                         

          INT. IMPALA - LATER

          Henry drives. He wears Joe's too small softball uniform.
          Eddie rides shotgun, the other two in the back. They
          grimly stare out the windows.

                          EDDIE
           Appreciate you driving, man.

                          HENRY
           So where's this game?

                          EDDIE
           Near Kaisertown. Like fifteen minutes.

                          CUT TO :

                         

          EXT. MAIN ST - DAY

          The car turns a corner on to Main Street.

                          EDDIE
           Pull up right over here. We gotta grab
           some beer money at that ATM.
          The car pulls up to a row of stores including the FIRST

          BUFFALO BANK.
          Eddie pats Henry's shoulder.

                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           Just hang tight. We'll be right back.
          Eddie and the guys get out. Henry notes this is strange.

           7.

                         

                         
          After a moment Henry realizes something stinks. He sniffs
          his sleeve.

                         BEHIND HIM
          In the rearview, Henry doesn't notice Eddie and the two
          guys slipping on SKI MASKS...

                         HENRY'S POV
          A PET STORE OWNER rolls up the security gates of his
          store and enters. He says good morning to all the
          animals. It's a strange one man show.

          LOUD ALARMS BLARE --
          Henry startles, looks back to where the sound's coming

                         FROM :

          THREE GUYS IN SKI MASKS
          Fly out of the bank on the corner and scatter in various
          directions. They're all wearing softball uniforms. A BANK
          GUARD chases them.
          ON HENRY, confused.
          A second bank guard FRANK (50s, African-American) is
          crossing the street toward the bank with two coffees. He
          sees what's going on, drops the coffees, and pulls his gun :

           FRANK (O.S.)
           You!
          Henry turns forward again.

                         A GUN
          Is pointing at him through the windshield.

                          FRANK (CONT'D)
           Freeze!
          Henry slowly raises his hands off the wheel.
          Frank sucks his teeth, his gun trained on Henry as the
          distant sound of BLARING SIRENS grows louder.
          Holding on Henry's stunned expression...

                         

          INT. POLICE STATION, INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

          Henry sits at a small table as a DETECTIVE, whose face we
          never see, paces back and forth.

                          DETECTIVE
           Henry, we know this wasn't your deal.

           8.

                         

                         
          Henry just listens.

                          DETECTIVE (CONT'D)
           All you have to do is give me those
           names. And you can go home. It's that
           simple.
          Henry's still silent.

                          DETECTIVE (CONT'D)
           Come on. Why are you sticking up for
           these people? They're not your friends.
           You've got a wife. You've got a job...
           don't you care?

                          (THEN)
           All you have to do is say something.
          Henry looks up at him, making eye contact for the first
          time.

           JUDGE (V.O.)
           ...in light of the fact that this is a
           first offence...

                         

          INT. BUFFALO COURTROOM - DAY

          Henry stands in a suit, flanked by his state-appointed
          ATTORNEY. Debbie sits in the gallery.
          A JUDGE stares at Henry.

                          JUDGE
           ...the court sentences Henry Torne to
           four years in prison for the crime of
           Felony 1st Degree Armed Robbery.

          WHACK!
          The gavel goes down.
          Henry blinks. He looks at his lawyer who is pleased with
          the sentence. He pats Henry, well done.
          Henry looks back at Debbie. She's just staring at him...

          CLANK!
          A CELL DOOR is SLAMMED SHUT...

                         

          INT. PRISON CELL - DAY

          Henry, wearing a prison jumpsuit, watches as the guard
          locks the door in front of him.

           MAX (O.S.)
           So. What're you in for?

           9.

                         

                         
          Henry turns.

                          HENRY
           Huh.

                          MAX
           I said what are you in for?
          A beat.

                          HENRY
           Bank robbery.
          MAX (60s) pulls up his pants, flushes the TOILET.

                          MAX
           Good. Clean. Simple. I like it.
          Henry just watches.

                          HENRY
           But I didn't do it.
          Max smiles. Goes to the sink. Washes his hands.

                          MAX
           Ah. Mistaken identity. A perennial
           favorite. Identities are just constructs,
           anyway. They're mistaken all the time.
          He dries his hands. Presents one of them to Henry.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           I'm Max.

                          HENRY
           Henry.

                          MAX
           Go on. Make yourself at home.
          Henry sits down on his bed.

                          HENRY
           So...what are you in for?

                          MAX
           Life.
          A beat. It's starting to hit Henry...

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Don't worry, you'll get used to it.

           10.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. PRISON CELL - MORNING

          All the cell doors SLAM open. Henry startles awake. Max
          is already dressed.

                          MAX
           Hurry up. We gotta go.
          Henry's disoriented.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Breakfast.
          A GUARD, seeing Henry still in his bunk, bangs his baton
          against the bars of the cell.

                         

          INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

          Max and Henry move along a line of convicts waiting for
          their food.

                          MAX
           `Monday is whole wheat bun-day.'
          Henry's lost in thought...

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           What are you thinking about?

                          HENRY
           Nothing.

                          MAX
           You're thinking something. Let me guess.
           You're thinking, `How did I get here?'
          Henry puts out his tray.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           How do you think any of us got here?

                          HENRY
           I'm not sure.

                          MAX
           I'll tell you how. Because we committed
           crimes. But we committed to the wrong
           thing. You see that was our mistake. We
           didn't fulfill our potential, we got
           angry and we took it out on other people.
          A bald, TATTOOED GANG-BANGER walks right past them to a table.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           See him?

           11.

                         

                         
          Henry nods.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Hector. He wanted to be a doctor. He
           could've been, but he chose not to fulfil
           his potential, he chose not to commit to
           his dream. And now look at him.

                          (THEN)
           Bad choices, see.
          Henry does.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           By the way, I recommend the potatoes.

                         

          INT. DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Max and Henry sit down at one of the long tables.

                          MAX
           That's the real crime, Henry. Not
           committing to your dream.
          They begin to eat.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           So what's yours?

                          HENRY
           My what?

                          MAX
           Your dream.

                          HENRY
           Not sure I ever had one.

                          MAX
           Never had a dream? What kind of a life is
           that?

                          HENRY
           I don't know. A pretty good one?

                          MAX
           Henry, you're in jail.
          Henry thinks about that. Puts a piece of potato in his mouth.

                         

          EXT. YARD - DAY

          Max and Henry walk through the crowded prison yard.

                          MAX
           But here's the good news. We got all this
           time to do. And time is a medium of
           exchange. You can buy things with it.

                          (MORE)

           12.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Knowledge. Self respect. Forgiveness. And
           in your case, you can figure out what
           your dream is.
          Max takes his arm :

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Your dream is your truth is your destiny.
          Henry looks at him.

                          HENRY
           I told you. I'm here by mistake.
          Max shoots a look back at him.

                          MAX
           There are no mistakes.
          Max suddenly glimpses some activity over Henry's shoulder.

                          HENRY
           What?
          Several convicts are making their way towards them...
          He pulls Henry close, his tone suddenly intense :

                          MAX
           But you're going to have to fight for
           that dream, Henry.

                          HENRY
           I am.

                          MAX
           You're at a crossroads now. There are
           going to be tests!

                          HENRY
           What tests?

          CRAACK!
          Henry's punched in the side of the head. The inmates grab
          him, throw him to the ground next to Max.

                          MAX
           This is your moment. Whatever you do now
           defines you. Go get em!
          Henry gets up : CHARGES the inmates, arms swinging,
          taking several down. He gives it everything he's got.
          They pile into him, pummeling him. Henry just keeps
          fighting...but it's hopeless.
          GUARDS rush in. Max watches.

           13.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. MAX AND HENRY'S CELL - NIGHT

          Henry lies on his bunk, his face battered and bruised.

                          MAX
           You did good, Henry.

                          HENRY
           I don't feel good.

                          MAX
           You're doing better than you feel.
          Henry touches his swollen eye. It stings.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Go to sleep, Henry.

                          (BEAT)
           Sleep is for the blessed.

                         

          INT. PRISON TIER - NIGHT

          One by one we see lights blinking off across the vast
          string of cells.

                          FADE OUT :

                         

          INT. VISITING AREA - DAY

          Henry's wife Debbie sits at one of the metal visiting
          tables. She's dressed up. She's really made an effort.
          A door opens, Henry appears. He looks different. Some
          time has passed. He smiles, walks over. Then sits.

                          DEBBIE
           Hi.

                          HENRY
           Hi. You look beautiful.

                          DEBBIE
           Thank you. How are you doing?

                          HENRY
           I'm okay. How about you?

                          DEBBIE
           I'm good.
          A beat.

                          DEBBIE (CONT'D)
           Listen, Henry. I have something I need to
           talk to you about.

           14.

                         

                         

                          HENRY
           Okay.

                          DEBBIE
           I fell in love.
          Henry takes that in.

                          HENRY
           Oh.
          Pause.

                          DEBBIE
           I just...I mean it just happened.
          Pause.

                          HENRY
           Okay. Wow...

                          DEBBIE
           I'm sorry, Henry.

                          HENRY
           It's alright.

                          DEBBIE
           You're not mad?
          He thinks.

                          HENRY
           No.
          He looks at her.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           I want you to be happy.

                          DEBBIE
           You too, Henry.
          No one moves.

                         

          EXT. PRISON YARD - LATER THAT DAY

          Henry sits on a bench alone, processing what just
          happened. He looks up at the sky. Gray and empty.
          Max arrives, sits down next to Henry, carefully puts a
          hand around his shoulder.

                          MAX
           I ever tell you I was married?
          Henry turns to him.

           15.

                         

                         

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           I mean nearly. I had a lovely
           correspondence going with Jocelyn
           Steinberg in Utica. Problem was when she
           finally came on visitor's day she said I
           was too short.
          Henry thinks.

                          HENRY
           Books and covers.

                          MAX
           Right. Books and covers.

                          CUT TO:

          TWO YEARS LATER

                         

          INT. MAX AND HENRY'S CELL - DAY

          There's music on a radio. Pull back to reveal Henry
          sitting on his bunk. He's grown a beard.
          Their cell has temporarily been converted into a
          makeshift BARBERSHOP.
          CONVICTS of various races wait to get their hair cut by
          Max the Barber.
          Max holds up a mirror to his customer, FINK.

                          MAX
           Clean as a whistle.

                          FINK
           (checking himself out)
           Max, I think you missed your calling.

                          MAX
           Thank you.

                          (THEN)
           Who do we got next, Henry?
          Henry checks the schedule by his side, calls out a name.

                          HENRY
           Hector. You're up.
          Standing just outside, A GUARD watches the make-shift
          barbershop carefully.
          Hector takes his seat. Max wraps a sheet around his neck.

                          HECTOR
           Hey, Max. When are you up for parole?

           16.

                         

                         

                          MAX
           October.

                          HECTOR
           Show us what you did for the board last
           time.

                          MAX
           I'm working.
          The other INMATES egg him on.

                          OTHER INMATES
           Show us!

                          MAX
           Leave me alone.

                          INMATES
           Come on! Show us.
          Max finally puts his clippers down.

                          MAX
           All right, so I'm sitting there, and the
           head of the board asks me what I'm going
           to do if they let me out this time. And,
           so...
          Max's face starts to shudder...his shoulders jerking back
          a little bit...

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           I get this twitch! and then I give him my
           answer: "I'm gonna break in your house, set
           your dog on fire, eat all your food, go on
           a naked rampage through your garden, dance
           in the streets of your l'il hometown like a
           crazed harpee, hurl myself headlong flaming
           through the ethereal sky like God's blackest
           angel and explode like a goddamn heavenly
           fireball!
          Eyes ablaze and face beetroot red and twitching like a
          mad man...

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Oh, yeah. You don't want ME. You don't
           want THIS. Not out THERE.
          The inmates look slightly scared. Max casually picks up
          his clippers and smiles :

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Believe me, I'm not going anywhere.
          They crack up. A beat.

           17.

                         

                         

                          HECTOR
           Hey, White Shadow. When's your review
           coming up?

                          HENRY
           Next month.

                          HECTOR
           You gonna do the twitch like your cellie?

                          HENRY
           Nope.

                          HECTOR
           What, you don't like it around here?

                          MAX
           Everyone knows Henry's innocent.
          Laughter.

                          HECTOR

                          (TO HENRY)
           The board don't like it when you deny the
           crime.

                          HENRY
           I didn't do the crime.

                          HECTOR
           Hey, but you got the time...so you may as
           well have done it.
          Everyone laughs.

                          MAX
           I like it! `You got the time, so you may
           as well have done the crime!'
          Everyone laughs again.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Now that's funny, Henry.

                          HENRY
           Yeah, you're right.
          Henry ponders.

                         

          INT. SHOWERS - DAY

          INMATES shower. Alot of noise and steam. Henry and Max at
          the end of a row.

                          HENRY
           You know you never did tell me what your
           dream was, Max.

           18.

                         

                         

                          MAX
           I'm living it.

                          HENRY
           Really?

                          MAX
           Sure! It's easier to live in here. You
           don't have to do anything. You just show
           up. In fact they even do that for you.
           I'm living the life.

                          HENRY
           This place is horrible, Max.
          Max thinks, lathering his hair...

                          MAX
           So why didn't you just say something?

                          HENRY
           When?

                          MAX
           Back then. When you had the chance. When
           you were still innocent.

                          HENRY
           I thought maybe this was my way out.

                          MAX
           And was it?

                          HENRY
           Yeah.

                          MAX
           See. There are no mistakes.

                         

          INT. MAX AND HENRY'S CELL - MORNING

          It's early morning. Henry's clean shaven, dressed in
          street clothes. He packs the last of his things into a
          sports bag, zips it up.
          Looks over at Max whose eyes are closed. Max looks
          vulnerable, like a child, the coverlet pulled right up to
          his neck.

                          MAX
           You got everything, kid?

                          HENRY
           Yeah.
          Henry, silent for a moment.

           19.

                         

                         

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           Maybe you should think about getting out
           of here sometime. I'll buy you a cup of
           coffee on the outside.

                          MAX
           The only thing I've ever missed in twenty
           three years is a hot bath. And that ain't
           worth walking out of here for.
          The cell door slides open.

           PRISON GUARD (O.S.)
           Torne! Let's go!
          Henry starts to leave.

                          MAX
           Don't forget. Your dream is your myth is
           your truth.
          Pause.

                          HENRY
           I thought it was my dream is my truth is
           my destiny.

                          MAX
           Just testing.
          Henry continues...stops at the door.

                          HENRY
           I'm going to miss you.

                          MAX
           Yeah, well. I hope I never see you again.
          Henry smiles.

                          HENRY
           I'm still gonna miss you.

                          MAX
           Get out of here, Henry.

                         

          EXT. PRISON - DAY

          It's cloudy. Henry walks through the front GATE of the
          prison. He takes a long deep breath of free air. It's
          cold. We see his exhale.
          He starts to walk.

           20.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY

          Henry sits in the back of the bus, the New York
          countryside streaking past him in a blur...

                         

          EXT. BUFFALO STREET - DAY

          Henry turns onto his old street.

                         

          EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE - DAY

          Henry walks up to his doorway. He hesitates before
          ringing the bell. A beat.
          The door opens. It's --

                         JOE
          The guy who got sick several years before. He's wearing a
          suit and tie now.

                          JOE
           Henry. How you doing?

                          HENRY
           Hey.

                          JOE

                          (CALLING OUT)
           Debbie! Henry's here.

                          (TO HENRY)
           Come on in. Make yourself at home.

                          HENRY
           Thanks.

                         

          INT. HENRY'S OLD HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

          Henry enters. His old house looks more or less the same.
          Joe heads over to small display of KITCHENWARE SAMPLES in
          the living room.

                          JOE
           Don't mind me. I'm just getting set up
           for my meeting. You want a beer?

                          HENRY
           Sure.

                          JOE

                          (CALLING OUT)
           Honey, do mind getting Henry a beer?

           21.

                         

                         
          As Joe clips several FLOW CHARTS onto an easel -- they
          look like they were done by a kid -- Debbie appears with
          a Bud Lite. She hands it to Henry. She smiles.

                          DEBBIE
           Hi.

                          HENRY
           Hi.
          It's not so awkward.

                         

          INT. GARAGE - MINUTES LATER

          Debbie leads Henry to a NAVY BAG and a BOX with Henry's
          name on it.

                          DEBBIE
           I think that's everything you wanted.

                          HENRY
           Thanks.
          A beat. They just stand there for a moment.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           Are you happy?

                          DEBBIE
           I am, Henry.

                          HENRY
           I'm glad.
          He means it.
          Henry picks up the box, shoulders the bag.

                          DEBBIE
           So what are you going to do now?

                          HENRY
           I don't know yet.
          Joe enters.

                          JOE
           Honey, they're starting to arrive.
          Joe grabs a DISPLAY STAND featuring kitchen products.

                          DEBBIE

                          (TO HENRY)
           We're having a meeting. It's his new
           business.

           22.

                         

                         

                          JOE
           Hey, maybe you'd be interested, Henry.
           You could become a distributor for Jin
           Chi.
          They all head out of the garage.

                          JOE (CONT'D)
           It's Korean kitchenware. The future of
           food storage. Plus, if you recruit
           distributors, you get paid even more.
          Passing through the living room arriving GUESTS notice
          Henry walking out carrying his box.

                          HENRY
           You mean like a pyramid scheme?

                          JOE
           No! God, no. It's a multi-layered
           marketing paradigm.

                          (HENRY'S LOOK)
           Anyway, why don't you give it some
           thought?
          Henry nods, starts to head out.

                          JOE (CONT'D)
           Henry.

                          HENRY
           Yeah?

                          JOE
           Listen, I just wanted to thank you. For
           not giving up my name.
          A beat.

                          HENRY
           I don't know your name.

                          JOE
           Sure you do. It's Joe.
          A beat.

                          HENRY
           Right. You're welcome Joe.

                          (TO DEB)
           I'll see you Deb.

                          DEBBIE
           Take care of yourself, Henry.
          He leaves.

           23.

                         

                         

                         

          EXT. STREET NEAR HENRY'S OLD HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

          Henry walks down the street with his box.
          A NEIGHBOR approaches, recognizes him.

                          NEIGHBOR
           Henry! How are you?
          Henry looks over.

                          HENRY
           I'm good. How are you?

                          NEIGHBOR
           Great. How was Greece?

                          HENRY
           Greece?

                          NEIGHBOR
           Debbie told us all about your trip.
          A beat.

                          HENRY
           I was in prison.

                          NEIGHBOR
           In Greece?

                         

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          A shitty apartment. Tiny. A bed. A desk.
          The TV is on low.
          Henry sits on a chair by the bed, the box between his
          legs, its contents spread out over the bed.
          Photographs of a long-forgotten vacation in Puerto Rico
          with Debbie. A Baseball glove.
          A high-school year book. Inside, a page of senior photos.
          He finds his own picture smiling at the thresh-hold of
          adulthood. Underneath his name it reads : "MOST NICEST

                         GUY"
          He studies the image a moment, flips to the inner cover,
          graffitied with hand-written messages from classmates
          including : "Henry don't be such a fag, Eddie Vibes"
          Henry puts the yearbook back in the box. Next to it are a
          pile of photographs spread out...images from Henry's
          childhood...of him and Debbie...of different times. He
          finishes putting everything back.

           24.

                         

                         
          A distinctive JINGLE! on the TV. Henry looks over.
          An ad for the local Buffalo lottery, a PRETTY YOUNG
          BLONDE in a sequinned dress speaks to the camera.

                          PRETTY BLOND

                          (ON TV)
           Take a chance on life, take a chance on
           Buffalotto!
          Henry closes the lid of the box, regards it.

                         

          INT. PAROLE OFFICE, BUFFALO - DAY

          Henry sits at a desk. He's handed a cup of coffee by his
          FEMALE PAROLE OFFICER -- whose face we never actually
          see.

           PAROLE OFFICER (O.S.)
           (re: the coffee)
           Is it okay?
          Henry takes a sip.

                          HENRY
           Good. Thank you.

           PAROLE OFFICER (O.S.)
           So what do you think?

                          HENRY
           About what?

           PAROLE OFFICER (O.S.)
           About building your life from the ground up.

                          HENRY
           Sure. Sounds good.

                         

          EXT. FIELD - DAY

          A grass field. It's raining.
          Henry steps into frame with a SHOVEL. Behind him an OLDER
          MAN in a cap pushes a wheelbarrow.

          IN THE DITCH - LATER
          From a low-angle we watch as Henry digs. He's a few feet
          down. The wheelbarrowman still watches silently.

           25.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Henry lies on his bed, staring up at the ceiling. His
          mind turns. He's starting to think...O.S. the sound of
          the `BuffaLotto' jingle on the TV.

                         

          EXT. DITCH - DAY

          It's snowing. The Wheelbarrowman watches silently as
          Henry digs another small ditch.

                         

          INT. BUFFALO SIX MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT

          Henry sits in the back row. We watch him as he eats
          popcorn. The movie flashes across his face. There are
          guns involved...

                         

          EXT. FIELD - DUSK

          A cloudy spring day. Henry climbs out of the ditch.
          Throws down his shovel and shakes the wheelbarrowman's
          hand.
          He walks away past ROWS OF GRAVES. He notices a flower
          poking through the dirt.

                         

          INT. PAROLE OFFICE - DAY

          The female PAROLE OFFICER sets down a cup of coffee.
          Henry drinks. We still don't see her face.

                          HENRY
           Thanks.
          She sits down at her desk.

           FEMALE PAROLE OFFICER
           Seems like yesterday you walked through
           that door.

                          HENRY
           It does?

           FEMALE PAROLE OFFICER
           Henry, You've done your time. You are now
           a free free man.

                          (THEN)
           How does it feel?
          Henry takes a breath.

                          HENRY
           Good.

           26.

                         

                         
          She signs a document and hands it to him.

           FEMALE PAROLE OFFICER
           So, What's next?
          Henry doesn't answer.
          The SOUND of boots, move in on HENRY'S EXPRESSION,
          staring, as we

                          CUT TO :

                         

                         
          HENRY'S DIRTY BOOTS march along the street with
          purpose...
          We follow them.
          After a while, the boots stop.

                         

          EXT. MAIN ST. BUFFALO - DAY

          HENRY looks up : we travel around him, see what he sees :

          THE FIRST BUFFALO BANK
          Directly across the street. Holding on Henry as he
          contemplates the place...
          Henry takes a deep breath. Focuses in.
          There's something happening, he's not sure what it
          is...an idea perhaps, an instinct that somehow with each
          passing moment becomes more like a knowing....
          A moment of revelation.
          He starts across the street toward the bank, moving now,
          heading right toward the front door, transfixed, as the
          SOUND DROPS out and he begins to smile --

          SCREEEECH!
          A car HITS Henry in the side. He's knocked down.
          A GIRL (30s)
          Rushes out of the car.

                          JULIE
           What are you doing? What the fuck are you
           doing? Are you okay?
           (into cell phone)
           Stan. I gotta call you back! I just ran
           someone over. No, he looks okay.

           27.

                         

                         
          She hangs up.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           You idiot, you weren't even looking where
           you were going! Are you okay?
          Henry's a little delirious.

                          HENRY
           I think I'm okay.
          He grabs his thigh. Winces with pain. Tries to get up.

                          JULIE
           No. Stay on the ground.
          The bank Guard FRANK rushes over.

                          FRANK
           Is he alright? Don't get up. I'll call an
           ambulance.

                          HENRY
           No, don't.
           (Starts to stand)
           I think I'm okay.

                          FRANK

                          (RECOGNIZING HIM)
           You!

                          HENRY

                          (RECOGNIZING HIM)
           Yeah. Me.

                          JULIE
           (to Frank, confused)
           Is he alright?

                          FRANK
           Are you alright?

                          HENRY
           Yeah. Fine.

                          JULIE
           He just walked right out into the street.
           He came out of nowhere.

                          FRANK
           I saw the whole thing. You were on the
           phone. You weren't even paying attention.

                          JULIE
           Yes. I was. I know how to drive.
          Cars are honking now as Henry limps his way over to the
          sidewalk.

           28.

                         

                         

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           What are you doing? Get back on the
           ground!

                          FRANK
           Park your car. I'm going to take him into
           that cafe.
          She jumps back in her car and pulls it over to the side.
          Frank comes over to Henry, takes his arm.

                          FRANK (CONT'D)
           They let you out, huh.

                          HENRY
           Yeah.

                          FRANK
           Let's get you a seat in here.

                         

          INT. ORPHEUM CAFE - CONTINUOUS

          Frank sets Henry down in a chair at one of the tables by
          the door.

                          FRANK
           Pierre! Une Verre d'eau.

                          HENRY
           Thanks.
          Julie comes in.

                          JULIE
           Did you call an ambulance? I'm calling an
           ambulance.

                          HENRY
           It's okay. I really am fine.

                          FRANK
           Yeah. He's alright for a guy who just got
           run over.
           (sucks his teeth)
           Lucky I guess.
          Frank leaves.

                          JULIE
           I think we should call a doctor.
          Henry just stares at her. For a long moment.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           What? Are you okay?
          He keeps staring...

           29.

                         

                         

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           Hello, guy? Are you okay? Do you need a
           doctor?
          A beat.

                          HENRY
           No. You look familiar.

                          JULIE
           What?
          It takes Julie a moment.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           Oh. That.

                          HENRY
           What?

                          JULIE

                          (SINGS)
           'Take a chance on life, take a chance on
           Buffa-lotto'?
          A beat.

                          HENRY
           Oh, that's why.
          An awkward moment.

                          JULIE
           Well, I guess you seem to be okay.

                          HENRY
           Yeah. I'm okay.

                          JULIE
           Okay. So you're okay?

                          HENRY
           Yeah.

                          JULIE
           Great.

                          (THEN)
           So I can go now?

                          HENRY
           Sure.

                          JULIE
           Bye.

                          (THEN)
           And be more careful.

                          HENRY
           Thanks.

           30.

                         

                         
          She leaves. He watches her go.

                          WAITRESS
           Anything else I can get you?

                          HENRY
           A bathroom?

                         HENRY
          Hobbles down the hallway. He notices the photos on the
          wall. A series of HISTORICAL SHOTS of OLD BUFFALO.

                         

          INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Henry peeing. His eyes drift to the photos on the wall to
          his right.
          He zeroes in on a prohibition-era newspaper framed FRONT

          PAGE.
          A photo of COPS IN TRENCH COATS posing in front of THE

          FIRST BUFFALO BANK WITH CRATES OF SEIZED BOOZE.

          `WHISKY IN THE VAULT!'

          ON HENRY'S FACE
          The sound of Henry's Pee STOPS.
          He takes a step closer to the next urinal over. Reads the
          rest of it...
          A COP IN A TUNNEL, smiling as he points up to a HOLE :

                         `TUNNEL DISCOVERED'
          After a moment Henry starts peeing again. Thinking about
          what he's just read...

                         

          EXT. ORPHEUM CAFE - DAY

          Henry comes out. Stares at the bank across the street.
          Looks both ways and then crosses the road.

                         

          EXT. BACK ALLEY - DAY

          Henry stands in the back alley behind the bank, feeling
          the place out...his head turns between the back door of
          the bank and the back of the building opposite...then
          looks down at his feet.
          He looks up again, notices the :

                         `BACKSTAGE DOOR'

           31.

                         

                         
          He goes over to it. It's locked.

                         

          INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAWN

          Henry's still in his clothes, lying on his bed, his mind
          reeling, the TV on low....
          He gets out of bed. Puts his foot in his boot.

           PRISON GUARD (V.O.)
           Max! You've got a visitor.

                         

          INT. VISITOR'S AREA - DAY

          Henry sits at a visitor's table, waiting. A moment
          passes, a DOOR CLANKS open and --

                         MAX
          Emerges with a guard.

                          MAX
           I thought I told you I didn't want to see
           your face again.
          Henry smiles.

                          HENRY
           Nice to see you too.
          He goes to hug him.

                          GUARD
           No contact.
          They sit. They look at each other a moment.

                          HENRY
           I figured it out.

                          MAX
           What?

                          HENRY
           My destiny.

                          MAX
           Good. What is it?
          A beat. Henry leans in.

                          HENRY
           The bank.

                          MAX
           The bank is your destiny?

           32.

                         

                         

                          HENRY
           Yeah.

                          MAX
           What bank?

                          HENRY
           The one I didn't rob.
          Pause.

                          MAX
           But you went to jail for it.

                          HENRY
           Exactly.

                          MAX
           What are you talking about Henry?
          Henry looks around. Closer --

                          HENRY
           I did the time, I may as well have done
           the crime.

                          MAX
           Ah, that. Time. Crime. Right.

                          (THEN)
           I still don't get it.
          Pause.

                          HENRY
           I need your help.

                          MAX
           What for?

                          HENRY

                          (A WHISPER)
           To rob the bank.
          Pause.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           So what do you say?

                          MAX
           I'm in Jail. That's what I say.

                          HENRY
           You've got your review coming up --

                          MAX
           -- So?

                          HENRY
           So you can get of here. If you want to.

           33.

                         

                         

                          MAX
           No. It's not as simple as that.

                          HENRY
           Yes, it is.

                          MAX
           No, it's not.

                          HENRY
           Yes. It is.

                          MAX
           No, it's not.

                          HENRY

                          MAX --

                          MAX
           I'm happy here. This is my home.

                          HENRY
           This is not a home. This is a prison.

                          MAX
           Whatever you want to call it, I'm happy
           here.
          A beat. Henry looks at Max now. He looks frail.

                          HENRY
           Max. You can't die in this place.

                          MAX
           I can die wherever I want.

                          HENRY
           You really want to die here?

                          MAX
           What do you want, Henry?

                          HENRY
           I'm asking for your help.

                          MAX
           To rob that bank?!

                          HENRY
           I've thought about it. It's the right thing.

                          (THEN)
           For both of us.
          A long beat. Max gets up :

                          MAX
           Henry. I got cards.

           34.

                         

                         

                          HENRY

                          MAX --

                          MAX
           Great to see you, kid.

                          HENRY
           Max!
          Max exits.

                         

          EXT. BUFFALO STREET - DAY

          Henry stares at the bank again...then walks down Mecca
          Road glimpses the marquee of `THE ORPHEUM' theatre.
          DAREK MILLODRAGOVIC's `THE CHERRY ORCHARD' by Anton

                         CHEKHOV

                         OPENS NOVEMBER 23
          Henry approaches, takes in the large photo of Darek and
          the PLAY POSTER, featuring a TREE, for the upcoming

                         PRODUCTION:
          Each `tree branch' of this poster dangles a small cherry-
          shaped PHOTO of the various ACTORS starring in it,
          including JULIE IVANOVA, the girl who ran Henry over, as
          Madame Ranevsky.
          A black and white American flag wrapped around the trunk
          of the cherry tree with bloody roots.
          Henry regards this with some interest, tries the theatre
          door.
          This one's open.

                         

          INT. ORPHEUM THEATRE - DAY

          Henry enters the lobby. The light is low. There's
          something almost magical about this place.
          Henry hears VOICES drifting in from the main theatre as
          he continues to walk, heading toward the sounds..

           JULIE (O.S.)
           (As Madame Ranevsky)
           Is it really me sitting here? I want to
           dance and clap my hands!

          INT. MAIN THEATRE - CONTINUOUS

          Henry enters the back of the theatre...sees the girl on

                         STAGE :

           35.

                         

                         

                         JULIE
          The girl who hit him with her car. She's in mid-speech :

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           (as Madame Ranevsky)
           I think I must be dreaming. God Knows I
           love my country. I love it deeply. I
           couldn't see out the train window I was
           crying so much.

                          (SHE'S TEARFUL)
           But...I must drink my coffee...thank you
           Firs, thank you, you dear old man. I'm so
           glad to find you still alive.
          Henry's transfixed. She's good. ARNOLD, regional actor
          extraordinaire, plays Lophakin :

           ARNOLD AS LOPHAKIN (O.S.)
           Your brother Leonid Andreyevich says I'm
           an upstart. A Money grubber!
           (marching to and fro)
           He can say whatever he likes. I don't
           care a bit.
          He chews up the scenery.

           ARNOLD AS LOPHAKIN

                          (CONT'D)
           I just want you to believe in me like the
           old days. I just want your wonderful
           tender eyes to look at me like they did

                          THEN --

                          DAREK
           Stop! Stop!
          DAREK, the CZECH DIRECTOR -- greasy-haired, balding and
          smoking -- stands up in his seat in the stalls.

                          DAREK (CONT'D)
           Too small, too safe! Stop showing me your
           `safe face' --

                          ARNOLD
           -- But I was --

                          DAREK
           Not you. You're doing the best you can.
           You.
          He points to JULIE.

                          DAREK (CONT'D)
           What are you doing?

                          JULIE
           I'm...listening.

           36.

                         

                         

                          DAREK
           Listening? You look like you're hearing.
           To hear is to be weak. To listen is to be
           strong. To listen is an action.
          Julie cocks her ear, mockingly. Darek marches up to her.

                          DAREK (CONT'D)
           What is that?

                          JULIE
           An action. I'm listening. Is this what
           you mean, Darek? Is this what you want?

                          DAREK
           No, Djula.

                          JULIE
           Then what do you want?
          They stare each other down.

                          DAREK
           I want you to be more. I want you to be
           better than that.
          He snatches the cup from her hand.

                          DAREK (CONT'D)
           Now go drink coffee. And don't think
           about what I want, think about what you
           want!

                          JULIE
           Fine. I'll go drink coffee.
          Julie marches off stage...

                          DAREK
           I'll go drink coffee too! Let's all `go
           drink coffee'.

                          (SHOUTS)
           Ten minutes everyone!
           (to his Eastern European

                          ASSISTANT)
           Olga! Coffee. Coffee for everyone. We'll
           all have coffee Djula! Every single one
           of us! And think about what we want!

                         HENRY
          Watches as Julie comes up the aisle. She notices him.

                          JULIE
           What are you doing here?
          She doesn't wait, just walks right past...
          Henry follows.

           37.

                         

                         

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           Are you here to sue me?

                          HENRY
           No.

                          JULIE
           Then what are you doing here?

                          HENRY
           I saw your picture outside. The door was
           open. I came in.
          She exits.

                         

          EXT. ORPHEUM THEATRE - OUTSIDE

          Henry catches up. She crosses the street, ignoring the
          traffic. Henry follows.

                          HENRY
           Is it always like that?

                          JULIE
           What?

                          HENRY
           (gesturing back to the

                          THEATRE)
           That.

                          JULIE
           You mean rehearsal?

                          HENRY
           Yeah.

                          JULIE
           It's a process.

                          HENRY
           Looks complicated.

                          JULIE
           It's all pain.

                          (THEN)
           Chekhov, right?
          They reach the Cafe. He opens the door for her :

                          HENRY
           I thought you were listening.
          She looks at him, curiously.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           I'm Henry by the way.

           38.

                         

                         

                          JULIE
           Julie.

                         

          INT. CAFE ORPHEUM - DAY

          They enter. It's busy.

                          PIERRE
           Madame Julie!

                          JULIE
           Coffee, Pierre.
          She points at Henry.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           You want one?

                          HENRY
           Sure.

                         SHE SIGNALS :

                          JULIE
           Two.
          They stand right there at the bar. Silence.
          Henry notices the play poster on the wall over her
          shoulder. Looks at it. Then back at her. Comparing her
          photo to the live person.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           What?
          She turns to see what he's looking at. A beat.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           So what do you think?

                          HENRY
           Doesn't look like you.

                          JULIE
           No, I meant the poster.

                          HENRY
           Oh. It's funny.

                          JULIE
           Actors on a tree is funny?

                          HENRY
           Yeah.
          She smiles. Pierre puts the coffees down on the bar.

           39.

                         

                         

                          JULIE
           That's the director's joke.
          She starts dropping cubes of sugar in her cup.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           He's making a comment on the American
           culture. Actors faces as falling fruit.
           Birth, death, the consumption of the ID.
          Henry's interested.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           To him, the American dream has become the
           world's nightmare. "You are the country
           of apocalypse."

                          (THEN )
           That's what he told us on the first day
           of rehearsal, anyway.

                          HENRY
           Oh.

                          JULIE
           The irony is, he loves the American
           dream. I mean that's why he's here,
           right?

                          (WHISPERS)
           But I know for a fact he hates himself
           for loving it. It's always an inside job,
           isn't it?

                          HENRY
           Yeah. I guess.
          Pause.

                          JULIE
           But the truth is I wasn't listening. I
           was playing it safe.

                          (THEN)
           He was right. The jerk. About that,
           anyway...
          She drinks her coffee.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           You know the Cherry Orchard was Chekhov's
           last play. He was dying when he wrote it.
          She thinks. He listens.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           It's perfect.

                          HENRY
           Why?

           40.

                         

                         

                          JULIE (CONT'D
           It's my last play too. Here in Buffalo.

                          HENRY
           You're leaving?
          She downs the last of her coffee.

                          JULIE
           Right after we're done.

                          (THEN)
           I'm glad you came by. Thanks for not
           suing me. I'll see ya.
          She leaves.
          He watches her through the glass as she walks across the
          street...right past the bank on her way back to the
          theatre.

                         

          INT. PRISON - MORNING

          MAX's cell door opens. He walks, happy and confident this
          morning.

                          INMATE

                          (CALLING OUT)
           Hey Barber, tomorrow lunch, right?

                          MAX
           Right.

                          ANOTHER CONVICT
           Give `em hell!

                          MAX
           I always do, Felipe!
          As Max reaches the end of the walkway, an OLD GUARD opens
          the next steel door for him.

                          GUARD
           Morning, Max. Here we are again.

                          MAX
           How's your grandson?

                          GUARD
           Just started first grade.

                          MAX
           That's great. The socialization begins!
          The Guard smiles as he leads him toward the PAROLE BOARD
          ROOM at the end of another long corridor.
          They stop at the door.

           41.

                         

                         

                          GUARD
           How many more of these you think you got
           in you, Max?
          Pause.

                          MAX
           As many as it takes.
          The Guard shakes his head, opens the door for him.

                         

          INT. PAROLE REVIEW ROOM, PRISON - DAY

          A PAROLE BOARD OFFICER is reading Max's file as he enters.

           HEAD PAROLE REVIEWER
           Good afternoon, Mr. Saltzman. Take a
           seat.
          The OFFICER gestures to the chair. The other members of
          the Board stare at Max.
          The head Parole officer leafs through page after page of
          denied applications. Max watches the pages turning, the
          years of his life going by, taking it in...

           HEAD PAROLE REVIEWER

                          (CONT'D)
           Mr. Saltzman. Could you please tell the
           board why you believe we should grant you
           parole?
          They all wait for Max's answer. He's silent.

           HEAD PAROLE REVIEWER

                          (CONT'D)

                          (HALF AMUSED)
           Come on, Mr. Saltzman, what have you got
           for us this time?
          Closer on Max. He looks like he might start to twitch at
          any moment....

           HEAD PAROLE REVIEWER

                          (CONT'D)
           (o.s.)
           Mr. Saltzman?

                          MAX
           Well...

                         

          EXT. PRISON GATE - DAY

          The gigantic PRISON GATES clank open. Max emerges, a tiny
          figure against the imposing facade. He's holding a small
          black valise. Looks like it was made in the 40s.

           42.

                         

                         
          Max looks a little less sure of himself.

                         HENRY
          Appears. Smiling.

                          HENRY
           I knew you could do it.
          Max looks around nervously.

                          MAX
           Where's the car?

                          HENRY
           I don't have a car.

                          MAX
           You don't have a car? What's wrong with
           you? You came to pick me up without a
           car. That's not picking a person up.

                          HENRY
           Yes, it is. I'm here. I'm picking you up.

                          MAX
           I don't know about this. Maybe this is a
           mistake.
          Max turns....walks back towards the gates. Starts to
          POUND on them.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Dave! Carl!

                          HENRY
           Max, it's okay. You're free.

                          MAX
           Open up! DAVE!
          No response.
          Henry approaches. Takes Max's bag.

                          HENRY
           Come on, Max.

                          MAX
           I don't like this.

                          HENRY
           Take it easy. There's nothing to be
           frightened of. I promise. You're okay.
           The bus station's just a short walk.
          Max starts to hyperventilate :

           43.

                         

                         

                          MAX
           I can't breathe. I -- can't breathe...
          Henry hesitates a moment, puts an arm around him...

                          HENRY
           You're going to be alright.

                          MAX
           (nearly on his knees)
           I'm going to die right here. I told you!

                          HENRY
           Come on, Max, we're going to miss that bus.
          Henry helps Max back up again.

                         

          EXT. BUS - DAY

          A GREYHOUND BUS rumbles through the countryside.

                         

          INT. BUS - DAY

          Henry and Max sit up front right next to the driver. Max
          has his eyes closed. He still looks woozy.

                          HENRY
           You hungry?
          He opens his bag and pulls out a sandwich. Offers it to
          him.
          Max doesn't say anything.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           It's pastrami. On rye.
          A beat. Max opens one eye...

          A KEY GOING INTO A LOCK...

                         

          INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY

          Henry opens the door for Max. They enter.

                          HENRY
           Here we are.
          Henry indicates the tiny bed in the corner of the living
          room. There are some second hand books on the bedside
          table like `Future Shock' by Alvin Toffler and
          Dostoyevsky.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           That one's yours.

           44.

                         

                         
          Max goes over, looks at the books. Sits down on the bed.

                          MAX
           Thanks.

                          HENRY
           Anything else you need?
          A beat.

                          MAX
           Yeah.

                         

          INT. HENRY'S BATHROOM - LATER

          Max reclines in the steaming TUB, luxuriating in the warm
          water. He closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and
          relaxes.
          After a moment he notices a fancy-looking bottle on the side.

                          MAX
           (reads the label)
           Ah. The land of milk and honey.
          Pours it into his bath.

                         

          EXT. BUFFALO STREET - DAY

          As they cross a street, Max notices a coffee shop on the
          other side.

                          MAX
           What is this obsession with coffee,
           Henry? When did that happen?

                          HENRY
           I'm not sure, Max. But it seems to give
           people a lot of purpose.
          They walk into the Cafe Orpheum.

                         

          INT. CAFE ORPHEUM, BATHROOM -- DAY


          THE PROHIBITION-ERA PHOTO
          Henry looked at earlier when he was pissing.
          Max is staring at the thing now too...

                          MAX
           Oh my God. Are you kidding? This was
           eighty years ago. It's ridiculous. Oh my
           God. That tunnel's probably not even
           there anymore! Are you dreaming, Henry?

           45.

                         

                         

                          HENRY
           It's a start.

                          MAX
           A start? This was your plan? An old
           cartoon in a pissoir?

                          HENRY
           It's an article.

                          MAX
           Whatever, Henry. Why don't we just go in
           with guns and do it the old-fashioned
           way?

                          HENRY
           No. No guns.

                          MAX
           What?

                          HENRY
           Someone could get hurt.
          Pause.

                          MAX
           That's sweet, kid.

                          HENRY
           (the tunnel photo)
           Maybe it's still there, Max.
          A beat.

                          MAX

                          (SURE)
           Uh-huh.

                          HENRY
           Maybe it is.
          Max looks at him.

                          MAX
           Right. Okay. Yes. First things first. Why
           don't we go take a look at this bank of
           yours?

                          (THEN)
           At least we know that's still there.
          Henry looks at him.

                         

          INT. FIRST BUFFALO BANK - DAY

          Max and Henry walk in to the grand banking hall.

           46.

                         

                         

                          MAX
           Money is a mistress with a hard heart.

          FRANK THE GUARD
          observes Max and Henry. Henry glances over at him too.
          Doesn't react.
          Frank watches them as they walk toward the CASHIER.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           I'd like to speak to your manager please.
           I'm interested in opening an account.

                          CUT TO :
          A NAME-PLACARD : `HOWARD TUTTLE, Assistant Manager'.

           MR. TUTTLE (O.S.)
           And which kind of account would you like
           to open?

          ON MAX AND HENRY
          Sitting in front of his desk.

                          MAX
           What kind do you have?

           MR. TUTTLE
           Savings. Interest only. Commercial --

                          MAX

                          (INTERRUPTING)
           You know my uncle put all his money in
           that vault when I was a kid, after we
           came from Europe, before the war...the
           Brownshirts. He said that vault will be
           there for three hundred years!

           MR. TUTTLE
           We hope he's right!

                          MAX
           He was never wrong. How long's it been
           there already Mr. Tuttle?

           MR. TUTTLE
           Since 1891.

                          MAX
           And in the very same spot, correct?

           MR. TUTTLE
           That's right. On the very same spot.

           47.

                         

                         

           MAX.

                          (TO HENRY)
           See, my boy!. History. It's all about
           history.

           MR. TUTTLE
           Now. As I was saying. We have savings.
           Interest only. Commercial --

                          MAX

                          (INTERRUPTING)
           You'll have to give us some time to think
           about which one.
          Max gets up.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Thank you. You've been very helpful.

           MR. TUTTLE

                          (CONFUSED)
           No. Thank you.
          Henry and Max walk out past Frank. He watches them
          leave...

                          FRANK
           Have a nice day, gentlemen.

                         

          EXT. ALLEY, BEHIND THE ORPHEUM - A MINUTE LATER

          MAX AND HENRY stand in the alley. Henry touches the back
          of the bank wall.

                          HENRY
           The vault is here.
          He walks across the alley...

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           The tunnel runs under here...
          He follows it toward the back door of the theatre.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           And ends up somewhere in there.
          He turns to Max.

                          MAX
           It's virtually robbing itself!
          Henry laughs. THE DOOR HITS the back of his head as it
          SWINGS open.

                          JULIE
           Jesus...goddamn! Goddamn Czech Chekhov
           shit!

           48.

                         

                         
          She storms out, punches the air, screams :

                          JULIE (CONT'D)

           AHHHH!!
          Suddenly notices Max and Henry standing there.

                          HENRY
           (rubbing his head)
           Hi.

                          JULIE
           Jesus. Henry?
          She looks at Max.

                          HENRY
           Julie, Max. Max, Julie.

                          MAX
           Hiya.

                          JULIE
           What are you doing here?

                          HENRY
           Oh, we were, you know --

                          MAX
           I was just showing Henry the place I used
           to perform.
          Henry shoots Max a look.

                          JULIE
           Oh. What?
          The door opens. SIMON, the Stage Manager, pokes his head out.

                          SIMON
           That's lunch, Julie.

                          JULIE
           Thank God.

                          MAX
           Chekov's tough stuff. It takes a steel
           stomach.

                          JULIE
           You know Chekhov?

                          MAX
           Of course. Apart from Gorbachev he's my
           favorite Russian.
          She laughs. Max approaches her.

           49.

                         

                         

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Would you mind if we took a look around?
           It's been over thirty years since I've
           been inside.
          She considers the request.

                          JULIE
           Sure.
          She gestures them inside.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           Sure. Yeah. Come on in.

                          MAX
           Thank you.
          As Henry passes :

                          HENRY
           How you doing?

                          JULIE
           Great. I'm in hell.

                         

          INT. THEATRE - SAME TIME

          Max walks to centre stage front like he's been there
          before. He looks out at the auditorium, a little
          emotional all of a sudden.

                          MAX
           Home again.

                          JULIE
           So what productions were you in?

                          MAX
           Oh. Shakespeare, Ibsen, Mahoney, the
           greats.

                          (A SMILE)
           And the not-so-greats!
          Simon arrives.

                          SIMON

                          (TO JULIE)
           Mary wants to fit your wig at four. Darek
           says to stay hungry.

                          JULIE
           Fuck him.

                          SIMON
           Got it.
          Max and Henry exchange a glance.

           50.

                         

                         

                          MAX
           Would it be a tremendous imposition to
           have a little tour for old time's sake?

                          JULIE
           He used to perform here.

                          SIMON
           I don't see why not. We're on a break.

                          MAX
           That okay, Henry?

                          HENRY
           Sure. Go ahead.
          Julie and Henry watch them go.

                          JULIE
           Is that your dad?

                          HENRY
           No. He's a friend.

                          JULIE
           He seems like your dad.
          Henry walks out onto the stage where Max was standing,
          getting the feel of it.

                          HENRY
           It's peaceful out here.
          Beat.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           Is it fun?

                          JULIE
           What?

                          HENRY
           Pretending to be other people.
          She thinks.

                          JULIE
           It's not really like that. I don't
           pretend to be someone else. I find some
           part of me, and reveal it in a new
           way...just inside of a character.

                          HENRY
           So, in a way, you're still playing `you'.

                          JULIE
           Yes. Exactly. In a way.

           51.

                         

                         

                          HENRY
           So what part of `you' are you playing
           now?

                          JULIE
           That's the question you always have to
           ask yourself.

                         

          INT. THEATRE BACKSTAGE, DOWNSTAIRS - SAME TIME

          Max follows Simon through a tight hallway of DRESSING

          ROOMS.
          They pass ACTORS eating lunch or playing cards. Nothing
          very glamorous.

                          MAX
           Ah, the inner sanctum. The magic before
           the magic! I remember it like it was
           yesterday.
          They enter the Green Room where ARNOLD is holding court.

                         

          INT. GREEN ROOM - CONTINUOUS


                          ARNOLD
           People often make the mistake in Chekhov
           of going down...but you must always
           always go up...
          Other ACTORS look at him with blank faces.
          Max gestures Simon closer. With a conspiratorial whisper -

                          MAX
           Simon, did you know there used to be a
           speakeasy down here during prohibition
           days?

                          SIMON
           Yes. And they hid the booze in the bank!

                          MAX
           I know.

                          SIMON
           And there was a tunnel too!

                          MAX
           I know!

                          (THEN)
           I forget. Where was it?

           52.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. THEATRE - SAME TIME

          Henry examines the fake bookshelves on the drawing room
          set. Julie sits in an armchair eating the sandwich she's
          pulled out of her bag.
          She watches him a moment.

                          JULIE
           So what's your story, Henry?

                          HENRY
           My story?

                          JULIE
           I mean, like...what do you do?
          Henry crosses the stage, goes to sit in the chair
          opposite her.

                          HENRY
           I'm figuring that out.

                          JULIE
           Does that mean you don't have a job?
          A beat.

                          HENRY
           I just got out of jail.
          ON JULIE. She wasn't expecting that.

                          JULIE
           Jail!

                          HENRY
           Sounds worse than it is.

                          JULIE
           Really? Jail sounds bad.

                          (THEN)
           Why were you in there?
          She takes a big bite of her sandwich.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           Are you a murderer or something?

                          HENRY
           No. Do I look like one?
          She studies him.

                          JULIE
           No.

           53.

                         

                         

                          HENRY
           What do I look like?
          She studies him some more.

                          JULIE
           I don't know. A criminal.
          He laughs.

                          HENRY
           I do?
          She laughs. Then stops. Dead serious :

                          JULIE
           Yeah.

                         

          EXT. DRESSING ROOM - SAME TIME

          A taped paper sign on the door reads `LOPHAKIN please
          knock'. Simon opens it for Max, shows him inside.

                          SIMON
           We got to be quick. Arnold doesn't like
           people in his dressing room.

                         

          INT. DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          A costume on hangers. A wig and beard in front of the
          mirror.
          Simon walks into the room. Places his hand on the far wall.

                          SIMON

                          (ENTHUSIASTICALLY)
           It was right here.
          Max comes up. Feels it now too.

                          MAX
           Booze, broads and lucre. The good old
           days. I like it.

                          SIMON
           They filled it in, in 1931 when they
           built the theatre.
          Max pads the wall like it's a good old friend, testing
          it...searching...

                          SIMON (CONT'D)
           Times have changed.

           54.

                         

                         

                          MAX
           All good things must come to...
           (he hits a hollow spot)
           ...an end.
          Max stops. Turns to Simon, and with a broad smile :

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Do you need volunteers?

                         

          INT. STAGE - SAME TIME

          Henry picks up a marked-up text of the Cherry Orchard
          that's on one of the chairs.

                          HENRY
           The Cherry Orchard.
           (leafing through it)
           So what happens? What's it about? Is it
           funny?
          Julie gets up out of her chair.

                          JULIE
           A woman returns to her family estate in
           the Russian countryside and realizes she
           has no choice but to sell her beloved
           Cherry Orchard, the magical place of her
           youth, the only place she ever felt safe.

                          HENRY
           I guess it's not funny.
          She looks at him.

                          JULIE
           It's about being forced to let go of the
           past and create a new life in order to
           survive.
          Max's voice booms :

           MAX (O.S.)
           That was great! This place is full of
           treasures.
          Max comes right up to them.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Thank you, Julie. And thank you, Simon.
           I'll see you tomorrow.

                          JULIE
           Tomorrow?

                          SIMON
           Max has very kindly offered to volunteer
           at the theatre!

           55.

                         

                         

                          JULIE
           Oh.

                          MAX
           Henry, let's get out of these people's way!
          Henry turns to Julie.

                          HENRY

                          (TO JULIE)
           What are you doing after rehearsal?

                          JULIE
           Why?

                          HENRY
           Do you like Chinese?

                          JULIE
           Yeah.

                          HENRY
           Golden Dragon?

                          JULIE
           It's okay.

                          HENRY
           Eight o'clock?

                         SHE DECIDES :

                          JULIE
           Sure.
          They look at each other as ACTORS return to the stage.
          DAREK moves towards his place in the front seats.

                          DAREK
           Work. Work! It's time to work Americans!

                          (SEES HER)
           Even you Djula...
          Max grabs Henry --

                          MAX
           Let's go.

                          HENRY
           See you, Julie.

                          JULIE
           Stay out of jail.
          Henry waves.

           56.

                         

                         

                         

          EXT. ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

          Max and Henry exit the back stage doors.

                          MAX
           You were right, Henry. You got a nose
           like a bloodhound!

                          HENRY
           You found it?

                          MAX
           Yeah. Right there. In Lophakin's dressing
           room.

                          HENRY
           Who?

                          MAX
           Lophakin. We find a way to get into his
           dressing room and we're right as rain!
          Henry and Max notice FRANK standing at the corner of the
          alley having a cigarette.
          He glares at them as they pass...

                         

          INT. APARTMENT, BATHROOM - LATER

          Henry gets ready for his date. Max keeps talking, sitting
          on the side of the tub as he draws the bath...

                          MAX
           I can see it, Henry. It's all in front of
           me. The vault. The bank. The tunnel. The
           pieces of the puzzle are on the table.
           All we got to do is put them in the right
           order!

                          (THEN)
           The only thing is the dirt...where does
           the dirt from the tunnel go?

                          HENRY
           What about the vault?

                          MAX
           First things first. I'm on the dirt.

                          HENRY
           Okay. How do I look?

                          MAX
           Like Henry.

                          (THEN)
           We had a good day, Kid. It's good to be
           back in the soup.

                          (MORE)

           57.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           (he starts to take off his

                          CLOTHES)
           Go have a nice supper.

                         A CHOPSTICK
          Henry places it between a PLATE and a NAPKIN, linking
          them together like...a tunnel...

                         

          INT. GOLDEN DRAGON - RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          Henry waits for Julie. He's all cleaned up. Fresh shirt.

                          JULIE
           Sorry I'm late. I'm starving.
          She sits. Looks at the menu. A GUY who's leaving, sees her :

                          GUY
           Julie.

                          JULIE
           Bruce.
          The guy glances at Henry. Leaves.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           That guy's a total dick. Hi, Henry.
          She studies the menu.

                          HENRY
           Hi. How was rehearsal?
          She puts it down. No answer.

                          JULIE
           I feel like duck.

                         

          INT. RESTAURANT - LATER


          PLATES ARE CLEARED
          It's the end of the meal. Henry listens.

                          JULIE
           I don't just want to be good, I want to
           be great. And I don't just want to be
           great in Buffalo.

                          HENRY
           Where then?

                          JULIE
           Don't laugh.

                          (THEN)
           Hollywood.

           58.

                         

                         
          He doesn't.

                          HENRY
           I guess that's where people go.

                          JULIE
           I don't want my legacy to be a Buffalotto
           commercial. And it's not going to be.
           Soon as this thing is done I'm out of
           here.

                          (THEN)
           Before it's too late.

                          HENRY
           Sounds like a plan.
          The waitress brings over the check and the fortune
          cookies.

                          JULIE
           I hate fortune cookies.

                         

          INT. JULIE'S CAR - LATER

          Julie sings along to the radio, smoking half a joint from
          the ashtray.
          Henry watches her. Julie knows she's being watched. She's
          enjoying herself.

                          HENRY
           We going anywhere in particular?

                          JULIE
           (hits the joint)
           Want some?
          Henry shakes his head no. She turns the radio up.

                          CUT TO :

          HENRY AND JULIE
          Walk along a precipice near some railings. They move
          closer to the ROAR.
          They look out at the flood-lit NIAGARA FALLS. Stand there
          a moment...

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           You know there's a whole bunch of bodies
           down there churning around. Just caught
           in the current.

                          (BEAT)
           They all took the risk and look what
           happened to them. Same in death as they
           were in life. Imagine that. You kill
           yourself and nothing changes.

           59.

                         

                         
          They both stare down into the roaring water.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           All those dreams churning around down
           there. It makes you sick.

                          (THEN)
           I got to get out of here.

                          HENRY
           I get it.
          They start to walk...

                          JULIE
           So what did you do before jail, Henry?

                          HENRY
           I worked at a toll booth.

                          JULIE
           Which one?

                          HENRY
           Rainbow bridge.

                          JULIE
           No!

                          HENRY
           Yes.

                          JULIE
           I had family that used to live on the
           other side. I took that bridge all the
           time. We must of met a hundred times!
          He nods. She's probably right.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           Wow. So you were one of the guys in the
           tollbooth with those weird rubber gloves?

                          HENRY
           Yeah.
          She laughs.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           What's so funny?

                          JULIE
           You were watching everyone go somewhere
           and you were going nowhere.

                          HENRY
           That's funny?

                          JULIE
           Yeah. Funny sad, not funny funny.

           60.

                         

                         

                          HENRY
           I worked nights. It gave me time to
           think.

                          JULIE
           About what?

                          HENRY
           About where I wasn't going.

                          JULIE
           See, that's funny.

                          (THEN)
           What about now? Where you going now?

                          HENRY
           I'm working on it.

                          JULIE
           What'd they send you to jail for Henry?

                          HENRY
           For trying to rob the First Buffalo Bank.

                          JULIE
           What!

                          HENRY
           I thought I was on my way to a softball
           game. It was a mistake.
          Pause.

                          JULIE
           Sounds like it.
          He looks at her. Decides :

                          HENRY
           But now I'm going to rob it for real.

                          JULIE
           You're going to rob the bank you already
           went to jail for robbing?

                          HENRY
           Yeah.

                          JULIE
           Ha!

                          HENRY
           There's a tunnel.

                          JULIE
           What tunnel?

                          HENRY
           Runs from the bank to the theatre.

           61.

                         

                         

                          JULIE
           My theatre?

                          HENRY
           Yeah.

                          JULIE
           Ha!
          She looks out the falls.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           You're fucking hilarious, Henry.

                          HENRY

                          (SERIOUSLY)
           Thank you.
          A beat. We can't tell what she's thinking...

                          JULIE
           You know what?

                          HENRY
           What?

                          JULIE
           I'm hungry.

                          HENRY
           What for?

                          JULIE
           (as the thought occurs)
           Ice cream.

                         

          INT. JULIE'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Henry leans against the sink watching Julie at the table
          eating Ice Cream. There's music on in the b.g.
          They watch one another for a moment. She takes a big
          spoonful.

                          JULIE
           I can't believe I'm sitting here.

                          HENRY
           Neither can I.
          She gets up.

                          JULIE
           I want to dance and clap my hands.
          She moves through into the lounge. Henry follows.

           62.

                         

                         

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           I think I must be dreaming!
          She starts moving around the room, dancing to the music.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           God knows I love my country. I love it
           deeply.
          She sits down.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           I couldn't see out the train window I was
           crying so much.
          Henry's not sure what she's talking about.
          She gestures to her copy of `THE CHERRY ORCHARD' on the
          coffee table.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           Page twenty one.
          Henry opens it.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           I couldn't see out the train window I was
           crying so much. But I must drink my
           coffee.

                          (THEN)
           Read Lophakin.
          She points to the right place. Henry, awkwardly :

                          HENRY
           `I have to go to Kharkov on the five
           o'clock train. Such a bother, I wanted to
           stay and look at you and talk to you.

                          (TO HER)
           You're as wonderful as ever....'
          He stops, looks at her :

                          JULIE
           Read the next line!

                          HENRY
           `Even more beautiful, and dressed like a
           Parisian...you could blow me down.'

                          JULIE
           Say it like you feel it. Like it's real.
           Say it to me.
          Henry takes a beat.
          This time he makes it his.

           63.

                         

                         

                          `HENRY
           Even more beautiful, and dressed like a
           Parisian...you could blow me down.'
          She laughs like a little girl.

                          JULIE
           You're good. Keep reading! And get up.
           Walk around!

                          HENRY
           `Your brother says I'm an upstart, a
           money-grubber.'

                          JULIE
           Yes, you are. You're a bank robber,
           Henry!
          He laughs.

                          HENRY
           (the text again)
           `I don't care a bit. I just want you to
           believe in me like the old days!'

                          JULIE
           (pulling him around the room)
           Don't stop --

                          HENRY
           `I just want your wonderful tender eyes
           to look at me like they did then.'

                          JULIE
           Again!
          Henry's getting into it.

                          HENRY
           `I just want your wonderful tender eyes
           to look at me like they did then.'
          She laughs some more. Comes closer.

                          JULIE
           I'm glad I ran you over.
          Henry puts the book down.

                          HENRY
           Me too.
          They kiss...

           64.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. JULIE'S APARTMENT -- MORNING

          Henry and Julie asleep in the bed. She opens her eyes.
          Realizes he's there with her...as if sensing her, he
          opens his eyes too.
          They look at one another.

                          JULIE

                          (SOFTLY)
           Good morning.

                          HENRY
           Good morning.
          She climbs on top of him. Henry smiles.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           Good morning.

                         

          INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - MORNING

          Sun streams in through the window. Tchaikovsky plays on a
          tiny transistor radio. Max humming to the music, reading
          `Future Shock' on the toilet.
          The sound of the front door of the apartment opening --

                          MAX
           Henry!

           HENRY (O.S.)
           Max.

                          MAX
           (pulling up his boxers)
           I figured it out! Once we're in that
           dressing room the dirt from the tunnel
           goes out through the roof!

                          HENRY

                          MAX --

                          MAX
           (rushing out into the front

                          ROOM)
           That bank doesn't stand a chance.
          HENRY is standing right there, holding a bag of
          groceries, JULIE is right next to him. Max goes white.
          He's in his underwear.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Ah. Company.

                          JULIE
           Good morning, Max.

           65.

                         

                         
          Max is frozen.

                          HENRY
           It's alright. She knows.

                          MAX
           She does?

                          JULIE
           I didn't know the dirt from the tunnel
           goes out through the roof.
          She laughs a little. Max looks at Henry like `what the
          fuck?'

                          HENRY
           We brought breakfast. How do you like
           your eggs?
          Henry enters the kitchen...leaving Max and Julie there.

                          JULIE
           It's okay. I'm not going to tell anyone.

                          MAX
           Hold on.
          Max follows Henry into the kitchen.

                         

          INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

          Henry unpacks the groceries.

                          MAX
           You told her?

                          (A WHISPER)
           About what we're doing?

                          HENRY
           Yeah. I did.

                          MAX
           It's a crime. You're supposed to keep
           crimes a secret.

                          HENRY
           It's okay, Max.

                          MAX
           No. It's not kosher.
          Pause.

                          HENRY
           How do you like your bacon?

           66.

                         

                         

                          MAX

                          (PISSED)
           Crispy.
          Max leaves the kitchen for the front room where Julie's
          waiting, amused by the whole thing.
          Max just stands there in his underwear a moment, sizing
          her up.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Okay. I'll get dressed.

                         

          INT. APARTMENT - LATER

          They eat.

                          JULIE
           So what were you in prison for, Max?
          Max slurps his coffee.

                          MAX
           I'm a confidence man.

                          JULIE
           You mean a `con' man?

                          MAX
           I never liked that word. It's only half
           of what it is. The word confidence comes
           from the latin. Fides. With Faith.
           Belief.

                          (THEN)
           That's what I'm about.
          She considers this.

                          JULIE
           You mean you make people feel good...and
           then you rip them off?

                          MAX
           Yes.
          He glances at Henry.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           But I was always much better at the
           feeling good part than the ripping off
           part.

                          (THEN)
           Hence, the prison.

                          JULIE
           Aren't you guys worried about getting
           caught?

           67.

                         

                         

                          MAX
           Not really. For me it's a win-win
           situation.

                          JULIE
           How?

                          MAX
           I like jail. Three hots and a cot.
          Julie looks at Henry now...

                          JULIE
           You too, Henry? You like jail?

                          HENRY
           No. I like it out here.

                          JULIE
           So why would you take the risk? Is it the
           money?
          Henry doesn't answer, starts to collect the plates.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           It must be the money.
          Henry smiles.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           You are a criminal. A greedy little
           criminal.

                          HENRY
           (washing the plates)
           `Your brother Leonid says I'm an upstart,
           a money grubber...

                          (THEN)
           ...but I don't care a bit'.
          He turns to her.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           `I just want you to believe in me like
           the old days.'

                          JULIE
           You remember!

                          MAX
           What is that?

                          JULIE
           It's Chekhov!

                          MAX
           Chekhov?!

           68.

                         

                         

                          HENRY
           We read it last night.

                          JULIE

                          (TO HENRY)
           You really are good.

                          (TO MAX)
           He's a natural.

                          MAX
           I thought you were on a date.

                          HENRY
           We were.

                          MAX
           Reading Chekhov's a date?
          Beat.

                          HENRY
           Yeah.
          She downs her coffee. Stands.

                          JULIE
           I got to get to the theatre --

                          MAX
           Can you give me a ride there?

                          JULIE
           Why?

                          MAX
           I'm a volunteer!
          She regards him a moment.

                          JULIE
           You weren't in any of those plays, were you?

                          MAX
           No.

                          (THEN)
           But can you give me a ride?

                         

          INT. ORPHEUM THEATRE - DAY

          Julie as Madame Ranevsky. Her brother GAYEV and her
          daughter VARYA are also on stage.

                          JULIE
           All white! All White! Oh, my Cherry
           Orchard. After the dark, stormy autumn
           and the winter frosts you are young again
           and full of happiness; the heavenly
           angels have never abandoned you...

                          (MORE)

           69.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           Oh, if only I could be free of the stone
           that weighs me down! If only I could
           forget my past!

                         REVEAL HENRY
          Watching from the back of the theatre in the semi-
          darkness.
          He's transfixed.
          Max watches too. He wears his volunteer badge.

                          GAYEV
           Yes and now the orchard will be sold to
           pay our debts, which seems impossible...

                          JULIE
           Look! It's mamma walking in the
           orchard...in a white dress!
           (laughing with joy)
           There she is.

                          GAYEV
           Where?

                          VARYA
           Momma, don't!
          A PROJECTION OF THE MOTHER FLOATS ACROSS THE SCREEN and
          dissolves into one of the Cherry Trees...
          Henry and Max speak in hushed voices :

                          MAX
           This is driving me crazy.

                          HENRY
           What?

                          MAX
           We could be digging right now!

                          HENRY
           We could?

                          MAX
           If we were in that dressing room.

                          HENRY
           It's rehearsal. There are people
           everywhere.

                          MAX
           This is pissing me off.
          Max leaves....after a moment he stops where he
          is...freezes...
          ...then turns back to Henry...

           70.

                         

                         

                          HENRY
           What?

                          MAX
           I got an idea.

                          HENRY
           What?

                          MAX
           You have to be Lophakin!

                          HENRY
           What?

                          MAX
           If you did we'd be able to get into that
           tunnel whenever we want.

                          HENRY
           I'm not an actor.

                          MAX
           You're not a bank robber either! And
           you're doing that.

                          HENRY
           Max. Come on.

                          MAX
           She said you were a natural. That means
           you can do it.

                          HENRY
           No, it doesn't.

                          MAX
           Yes, it does Henry.

                          (SHAKES HIM)
           You ARE Lophakin! A man who came from
           nothing. A man who's not afraid to create
           a new life.

                          (POINTS)
           A man who's in love with her!
          Henry stares at Julie, mid performance, on the stage.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Your dream is your truth is your destiny!
          Henry thinks...

                          HENRY
           I can't be Lophakin. They have a
           Lophakin.
          Max thinks...

           71.

                         

                         

                          MAX
           What if they didn't?

                          HENRY
           There has to be another way.
          Max, frustrated :

                          MAX
           Kid, You forced me out of jail to help
           you. And I'm going to goddamn help you.
           But you got to help me help you. Now I
           need to know...
           (a fierce stare)
           ...do you want this bank or not?
          On Henry...

                          HENRY
           Yes. I want it.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           Then you're gonna be Lophakin!

                          CUT TO :

                         

                         ARNOLD
          Walks down the street. It's snowing. He approaches the
          theatre.

                         

          INT. THEATRE, BACKSTAGE - MORNING

          Arnold enters, shivering, shaking the snow off his
          coat...

                          ARNOLD
           Good morning, everyone!
          None of the actors pay him much attention. He pours
          himself a cup of coffee, makes his way toward his
          dressing room.

                         

          EXT. DRESSING ROOM - MORNING

          Arnold opens the door with his key.

                         

          INT. THEATRE DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Arnold enters, hangs up his coat. There is a FORMAL
          ENVELOPE leaning against his make-up mirror.
          He approaches. Opens it. Starts to read...

           72.

                         

                         
          As he absorbs the words he lets out a small gasp..
          and...falls into his chair.
          After a moment he puts down the letter and stares at
          himself in the mirror.

                          ARNOLD
           You knew this day would come. You deserve
           this, lubya.
          He closes his eyes. Bows his head. Starts to weep...

                         

          INT. THEATRE - MORNING

          CLOSE ON DAREK : the veins on the side of his forehead
          pulsate with rage...

                          DAREK
           Unprofessional shit!

                          ARNOLD
           Mr. Millodragovich --

                          DAREK

                          (HISSING)
           Shit!

                         

          INT. THEATRE - MORNING

          Julie stands in the wings. Max joins her.

                          MAX
           What's happening?

                          JULIE
           Arnold's leaving the production.

                          MAX
           Oh. Gosh.

          DAREK AND ARNOLD
          on the stage. Simon behind them. Darek is right in

                         ARNOLD'S FACE :

                          ARNOLD
           But I have no choice it's Willie Lohman
           we're talking about!
           (brandishing the letter)
           A Ken Waterstone production!

                          DAREK
           OOOH-LA-LA! A Ken Waterstone production.
           The heaven's have opened. You lucky boy.

                          (MORE)

           73.

                          DAREK (CONT'D)
           Run, run, to that pandering, populist,
           piece-of-shit-Waterstone and his
           spineless productions! You're perfect for
           it.

                          ARNOLD
           Good-bye, Darek.

                          (THEN)
           I'm sorry.
          Arnold marches off the stage with his case.

                          DAREK
           Simone! I need a new Lopakhin. Now.

                          (CALLING OUT)
           I'm dying, Olga! Cigarettes! Cigarettes
           NOW! And COFFEE!

                          SIMON
           We'll hold auditions this afternoon,
           Darek! I'll get the list --
          Darek ingests caffeine and nicotine at an alarming rate :

                          DAREK
           I've seen that shit-list! It's a
           disaster.

                          SIMON
           What do we do?

                          DAREK
           I must think.
          He moves stage left past Julie...

                          DAREK (CONT'D)
           Djula! Your orchard cannot be felled
           before she has a chance to grow.
          And with that he disappears with Olga out the door.

                          JULIE
           Perfect.
          Beat.

                          MAX

                          (A SHRUG)
           It is Ken Waterstone.
          She shoots him a look, picks up her stuff and goes...

                         

          EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

          Julie, on the phone, searches for her keys in the bag as
          she approaches her car.

           74.

                         

                         

                          JULIE
           Yes, Stan, yes! I know it's bullshit but
           that's what's happening...

                          (SHE LISTENS)
           I don't know, he's `thinking'...
          She gets in the car. Tries to find a roach in the
          ashtray. A KNOCK at the passenger window.
          She looks up. It's MAX.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           What?
          He gestures, `Can I come in?'. Max gets in.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           Sorry, I can't give you a ride --

                          MAX
           You said he was a natural.

                          JULIE
           Stan. Let me call you back.
           (she hangs up, to Max)
           What?

                          MAX
           Henry.

                          JULIE
           Henry what?

                          MAX
           Henry would be perfect for it.

                          JULIE
           Perfect for what?

                          MAX
           For Lophakin.
          It takes a moment till her mind gets a hold of the idea.

                          JULIE
           You mean Henry should play Lophakin?

                          MAX
           Yes.
          She laughs.

                          JULIE
           He's not even an actor!

                          MAX
           Exactly. He'd be playing himself.
           (off her shocked look)
           Think about it Julie! He is Lophakin.

                          (MORE)

           75.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           A man who came from nothing. A man who's
           not afraid to create a new life and put
           his past behind him. A man who's in love
           with you...Madame Ranevsky.
          A beat. She does think about it.

                          JULIE
           Why do I feel like the earth is suddenly
           shifting under my feet?

                          MAX
           Fact is you need a Lophakin and Lophakin
           needs a dressing room.

                          (BEAT)
           Can you get him in to see Darek?
          She hesitates...

                          JULIE
           What's going on here, Max? What are you
           doing?

                          MAX
           Nothing.
          She regards him. Suspiciously.

                          JULIE
           You made this happen, didn't you?

                          MAX
           Sometimes a good guy needs a less good
           guy to help the good guy be good.
          He smiles. A beat :
          She SLAPS him hard across the cheek.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Fair enough.
          They just sit there for a moment...

                          JULIE
           What am I supposed to do now?

                          MAX
           He just needs a shot. One audition. Let
           the chips fall where they may.

                          JULIE
           What if it doesn't work?

                          MAX
           They'll get someone else.
          She thinks...

           76.

                         

                         

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Give him a shot. One shot. That's all I'm
           asking, Julie.
          She thinks some more...

                          JULIE
           Okay, confidence man.

                         

          INT. DAREK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Julie sits, looking at Henry who stands in the middle of
          the living room of Darek's apartment...

                         DAREK
          Circles HENRY...walking around him...an animal tracking
          its pray...he's chain-smoking...

                          DAREK
           ...you've never had any training...you've
           never been in a production...you don't
           even know the play...

                          HENRY
           I read it. I think I know the scene.

                          DAREK
           Think.
          He glances at Julie. Then back at Henry.

                          DAREK (CONT'D)
           Start.

                          HENRY

                          (READING)
           `Your brother , Leonid Andrevich...'

                          DAREK
           How can you perform Chekhov and not be
           able to say AND-REY-E-VICH! Now say it!

                          HENRY

           ANDREYEVICH.
          Darek nods, continue :

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           Your brother, Leonid ANDREYEVICH says I'm
           an upstart, a money grubber --

                          DAREK
           A what?

                          HENRY
           A money-grubber!

           77.

                         

                         

                          DAREK
           Are you?

                          HENRY

           NO!

                          DAREK
           Convince her.
          Darek pushes Henry closer to Julie. She stands :

                          HENRY
           Your brother, Leonid Andreyevich says I'm
           an upstart, a money grubber. He can say
           whatever he likes. I don't care a bit --

                          DAREK
           (into his ear)

           NEITHER DO I.
          Henry ignores him and with twice the passion --

                          HENRY
           I just want you to believe in me like in
           the old days.

                         JULIE WHISPERS :

                          JULIE
           Show me, tell me.
          Darek laughs, circling...
          Henry takes her hand now...his voice drops...

                          HENRY
           Good God in Heaven. My father was one of
           your father's serfs, and your
           grandfather's serf before that.
           But you, you did so much for me in the
           old days that I've forgotten all that...
          His yearning is suddenly palpable. Intense. Tender.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           I love you...like a sister...more than a
           sister.
          Henry drops to his knees, supplicates.

                          DAREK
           You piece of shit! Yes!
          Henry just breathes. He's unbreakable.
          A beat.

                          DAREK (CONT'D)
           Good.

           78.

                         

                         
          Henry looks up.

                          HENRY
           Good?

                          DAREK
           Yes.
          Darek considers him.

                          DAREK (CONT'D)
           Tomorrow. Be more good.
          Henry and Julie share a look. He actually did it.

                         

          INT. JULIE'S CAR -- NIGHT - MOVING

          She drives. Henry rides shotgun. They both look at the
          road ahead. In silence.
          After a while...

                          JULIE
           Does this make me an accessory?

                          HENRY
           I think so.
          A beat.

                          JULIE
           Things have certainly gotten a lot more
           interesting since you showed up.

                          HENRY
           You mean since you ran me over...
          She smiles.

                         

          INT. JULIE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

          They make love. It's more intense than before. They
          climax.
          They lie there, breathless, looking at each other...

                         

          INT. KITCHEN TABLE - LATE AT NIGHT

          She makes tea. Henry sits at the table watching her.

                          JULIE
           So why are you robbing the bank, Henry?
          He doesn't answer.

           79.

                         

                         

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           It's not just about the money, is it?

                          HENRY
           No.

                          JULIE
           So why are you doing it?
          It takes a moment for him to answer.

                          HENRY
           I used to sit in that toll booth and
           think about just getting in one of those
           cars, going wherever they went. Just
           joining someone else's life.

                          JULIE
           You were asleep at the wheel.
          Henry smiles.

                          HENRY
           Yeah, I was.

                          (THEN)
           It was easier for me to go to jail than
           tell my wife the truth.

                          JULIE
           Which was?

                          HENRY
           That I was going along with everything. I
           didn't know I could change it.

                          (THEN)
           So now I'm changing it.

                          JULIE
           Robbing the bank is changing it?

                          HENRY
           It already has.
          She gets the honey out of the cupboard. Pours some in her
          tea.

                          JULIE
           What was your wife like?

                          HENRY
           Nice.
          A beat.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           Are you sure you're okay with this? I
           know it's a lot.
          She turns to him.

           80.

                         

                         

                          JULIE
           Not for a girl like me, Henry.

                         

          INT. ORPHEUM THEATRE STAGE - MORNING

          Darek addresses the full cast. Henry by his side.

                          DAREK
           This is Mr. Henry Smith. He will be
           taking over the role of Lophakin. If you
           please.
          He leads a light round of applause. Henry acknowledges

                         IT:

                          HENRY
           Thanks. Thank you. Looking forward.

                          DAREK
           Top of act three. Twenty minutes. Olga,
           cigarettes!
          Henry walks briskly away. Julie watches him...

                         

          INT. ORPHEUM THEATRE - MORNING

          Henry enters his dressing room, locking the door behind
          him. Max is already waiting. He turns the music on.
          They move the GIANT ARMOIRE that's against the wall
          aside.
          Max spreads a blanket on the floor to catch the falling
          rubble and holds another against the wall to muffle the
          sound.
          Henry pulls a sledgehammer out of a bag :

          WHACK!
          He POUNDS the wall AGAIN and AGAIN...

                         

          INT. TUNNEL - LATER

          The blanket is pulled aside to reveal MAX AND HENRY on
          the other side looking in. Max shines his flashlight

                         REVEALING :

          THE EMPTY OLD TUNNEL BEYOND
          It's dusty. Max climbs through the hole, disappears down
          the tunnel. Henry follows, counting his steps...

           81.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. OLD TUNNEL - DAY

          Max and Henry, stooped over, make their way down the
          dank, dark passage.
          Max's flashlight combs the floor. A glint of light now as
          something FLASHES.

                          MAX
           Tracks! Trolley tracks!
          The beam scours the blackness ahead looking for the
          end....and there it is. A soot-covered WALL maybe ten
          feet ahead.
          They reach it. Henry touches the damp, decrepit brick,
          turns to Max.

                          HENRY
           There's still twenty feet to go.
          He turns back to him :

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           We're going to need another pair of
           hands.

                         

          EXT. `GAMETIME' SPORTS BAR, BUFFALLO OLD TOWN - NIGHT

          It's cold out. Max and Henry walk inside.

                         

          INT. `GAMETIME' SPORTS BAR, BUFFALLO OLD TOWN - NIGHT

          A giant screen showing the game. Henry and Max arrive at
          the bar.

           LOUD VOICE (0.S.)
           No! No! NO! You got to be kidding me! You
           suck! You SUCK! Could you possibly SUCK
           anymore?

                          HENRY
           That's him.

                          MAX
           That's him?
          Henry and Max watch as JOE grabs his head, flops into a chair.
          Max looks concerned.

                         

          INT. BOOTH - LATER

          Henry and Max sit with the guy -- JOE who's drunk.

           82.

                         

                         

                          HENRY
           Thanks for meeting us.

                          JOE
           Sure.
          Joe is looking worse for wear.

                          HENRY
           How's your pyramid scheme?

                          JOE
           It wasn't a pyramid scheme.

                          HENRY
           Okay.
          Joe hits his Schooner Longneck.

                          JOE
           It all fell apart.

                          (THEN)
           We were banking on that money, Henry. And
           now all I've got is a garage full of dumb
           Korean plastic.

                          MAX
           What's he talking about?

                          HENRY
           Kitchenware.

                          MAX
           Oh.

                          JOE
           See what happens when a person tries to
           go `legit'?

                          (THEN)
           It's killing me.
          Joe drains his beer. The WAITRESS arrives with a bucket
          of steaming wings.

                          HENRY
           So how's Debbie?

                          JOE
           She's worried, Henry. The baby's due in a
           couple months.
          He grabs a wing. Rips off the meat.

                          HENRY
           She's pregnant?

                          JOE
           Yeah, she's pregnant.

           83.

                         

                         
          Henry takes it in.

                          HENRY
           Congratulations.

                          JOE
           Thanks, Henry.

                          (THEN)
           It's okay if you want to punch me out.
           Tonight would be a good night. In fact I
           could use it.

                          HENRY
           Come on. This is great news.
           (off Joe's hopeless look)
           It's going to be okay.

                          JOE
           Really? It is? You know how much diapers
           cost? You know how much it costs to send
           a kid to college?

                          MAX
           You want to send your baby to college?
          Joe keeps going on the wings. He's making a meal of it...

                          JOE
           Of course not. I'm just saying. The kid
           needs stuff. Stuff that's expensive.
           Stuff it deserves.

                          (THEN)
           These things are hot! I'm on fire.

                          HENRY
           Listen, Joe, maybe we can help.
          A beat.

                          JOE

                          (WIPING OFF)
           How?

                          HENRY
           We might have a job for you.
          Max shoots a look at Henry. Joe chugs a glass of water,
          looking at both of them now.

                          JOE
           No foolin'?

                         

          INT. TUNNEL - DAY

          Henry, Max and Joe stand hunched over at the end of the
          tunnel.

           84.

                         

                         

                          HENRY
           There's maybe twenty feet till the bottom
           of that vault.

                          JOE
           That's a lot of dirt, Henry.
          Max studies Joe.

                          HENRY
           So what do you think?

                          JOE
           I think we should get some guns and go
           get the money through the front door!

                          HENRY
           No guns. People could get hurt.

                          JOE
           What about fake ones?

                          HENRY
           They're still guns.

                          MAX
           Listen Joseph, guns are dangerous and
           we're not doing a simple hold-up. Tellers
           and tears and chump change. We're doing
           an old fashioned heist. We're going right
           into the belly of the beast.

                          (THEN)
           Are you in or are you in?

                         ON JOE
          Considering it...
          He picks up a shovel and CRUNCHES into the wall of dirt.

                          JOE
           I hope we don't get caught.

                         

          INT. JULIE'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- NIGHT

          Henry and Julie are in bed. He memorizes his lines. The
          TV's on low. Julie's Buffaloto commercial comes on. Julie
          snaps it off.

                          JULIE
           I hate that commercial.

                          HENRY
           I like it.
          She looks at him.

           85.

                         

                         

                          JULIE
           So what's your plan?

                          HENRY
           For what?

                          JULIE
           For when it's done. After.
           (making light of it)
           Am I going to see your picture in the
           post office or something?

                          HENRY
           I hope not.

                          JULIE
           But have you thought about what happens
           after?

                          HENRY
           Not really, no.
          He thinks carefully before he says it :

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           I don't know. Maybe I could meet you out
           west...

                          JULIE
           Out west?

                          HENRY
           Yeah. Maybe you could meet me there.

                          JULIE

                          (SHE LAUGHS)
           When did you think of that?

                          HENRY
           Just now.

                          (THEN)
           So what about it?

                          JULIE
           What about what?

                          HENRY
           Meeting me --

                          JULIE
           -- I'm not going anywhere, Henry --

                          HENRY
           You're not?

                          JULIE
           No.

           86.

                         

                         

                          HENRY
           I thought that was your plan. Do the play

                          AND --

                          JULIE
           Plans change, Henry. Okay?
          She gets out of bed. Throws on her robe.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           I think I ran out of maple syrup.

                         

          INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

          We follow Henry as he walks through her apartment and
          finds Julie in the kitchen, standing at the sink, not
          moving.

                          HENRY
           Is there a reason you didn't leave
           before?

                          JULIE
           Because life is fucked. It never works
           out the way you want it to.
          Silence...

                          HENRY
           Yeah. Well. Maybe...

                          (THEN)
           But you could still meet me.

                          JULIE
           Right! On the lam? You're dreaming.

                          HENRY
           It was just an idea. Why not --

                          JULIE
           This isn't going to work out, Henry.
          She turns to face him.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           Didn't we both know that?
          On Henry.

                          HENRY
           I didn't.

                          JULIE
           I did.
          Silence.

           87.

                         

                         

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           I think you should leave.
          Henry just stands there...stunned.

                         

          EXT. BUFFALO STREET - NIGHT

          Henry leaves Julie's apartment. There's snow on the
          ground. It's freezing out here.
          He starts to walk.

           MAX (O.S.)
           It's going to be incredible. I'm talking,
           Florida...

                         

          INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Max hungrily munches his cheerios at the table.

                          MAX
           Palm trees. Sandy beaches. All you can
           eat sunshine. Grapefruits as big as your
           head!
          Henry sits across from him.

                          HENRY
           Why couldn't I have met her after?

                         

                          MAX
           Who?

                          HENRY
           Julie. I asked her to meet me. After
           we're done.

                          MAX
           Oh yeah? What'd she say?

                          HENRY
           She said no.

                          MAX
           Of course she said no.

                          HENRY
           Why of course?

                          MAX
           Because life ain't like that. There's
           always a cost. That's why they call it
           life. You got to pay somewhere. The piper
           must be paid to pipe.

           88.

                         

                         

                          HENRY
           I paid already, Max.

                          (THEN)
           I don't want to leave her.
          Max looks at him. About to say something --
          A KNOCK at the door.

                          MAX
           Who's that?

                          HENRY
           I'll check.
          Henry walks to the door.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           Who is it?

           JOE (O.S.)
           It's me. Joe.
          Henry opens it. JOE stands there. He's drunk. And a
          little sheepish. Now we see why : EDDIE VIBES is standing
          right beside him. He walks right on in.

                          JOE (CONT'D)
           Sorry, Henry.

                          EDDIE
           The same bank. Shit, Henry. Now that's
           poetry! I like it.

                          MAX
           Who is this guy?
          Eddie beams at Max.

                          EDDIE
           Your new partner.
          Max looks at Henry : `huh?'

                          MAX
           What do you mean?

                          EDDIE
           I'm in. Or you're out.

                          JOE
           I screwed up. Sorry, Max.
          Joe lies down on the floor. He's drunk as a skunk.

                          EDDIE
           (amused by the whole thing)
           Joe tells me you guys might need a little
           help with that vault. I know the whole story.

           89.

                         

                         
          He sits.

                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           And I don't dig. Dig?

                          (THEN)
           Got any cold ones?

                          MAX
           Joe doesn't know what he's talking about.
           He's a drunk. He made a mistake. Get out
           of that chair.
          Eddie laughs. Leans back on it.

                          EDDIE
           Relax, old man. Henry and I go way back.
           We've known each other since high school,
           isn't that right?

                          HENRY
           Yeah. I know you.

                          EDDIE
           Appreciate you keeping your mouth shut,
           Henry. One thing I admire in a man is the
           quality of loyalty.

                          HENRY
           What do you want, Eddie?

                          EDDIE
           Nothing. Just the American dream.

                          CUT TO :

          MAX AND HENRY
          At the window. Looking down as EDDIE gets into his car.
          He senses them watching him. Turns around. Gives them the
          thumbs up.

                         

          INT. APARTMENT - SAME TIME

          Max and Henry watch Eddie leave.

                          MAX
           I'm gonna kill him. With a knife.

                          HENRY
           You can't kill him.

                          JOE
           (slurred, on the floor)
           Yeah. You can't kill him, Max. He's got
           the vault --

                          MAX
           Shut up, Joe.

           90.

                         

                         
          He looks over at Joe on the floor. Thinks about how easy
          it would be to just kick him in the head.

                          JOE
           Deb says we can't have sex till the kid's
           born. Says the kid'll know about it.

                          MAX
           Go home. Please. Before it's too late.

                          CUT TO :

                         

          INT. STAGE - DAY

          Henry in period costume. He has a beard. He watches from
          the stalls as they run a dress rehearsal.

                          TROFIMOV
           I'm sorry to be blunt, but, for God's
           sake, the man has robbed you.

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           (stopping her ears)
           No! No! No! Don't say that!

                          TROFIMOV
           He's a scoundrel: everybody knows it but
           you. He's a petty scoundrel, a user...
          ON HENRY, feeling like the accused. From the stage Julie
          sees him.

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           You are twenty six or twenty seven, and
           you're still in the lower grades!

                          TROFIMOV
           Who cares?
          She locks eyes with Henry now :

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           You ought to be grown up by now. At your
           age, you ought to understand about love --

                          DAREK
           Where are you, Djula? Where?!

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           (with double the fire)
           You ought to love someone yourself! You
           ought to have an affair. Yes! Yes!

                          DAREK
           Yes. Yes. Good Djula! Scene.

                          (THEN)
           Carlotta and the girls.

                          (MORE)

           91.

                          DAREK (CONT'D)

                          (A CLAP)
           Let's run the magic scene!
          Julie walks off the stage. She knows Henry is waiting for
          her.

                          HENRY
           What happened last night?

                          JULIE
           I came to my senses.

                          (THEN)
           And you should too.
          She walks on. He follows...

                          HENRY
           We should talk about it.
          She turns.

                          JULIE
           I don't want to, Henry.

                         

          INT. DRESSING ROOM - LATER

          Henry arrives to find Max attaching one of the bags of
          dirt to a pulley. Above them, Joe begins to hoist it up
          through the open skylight.
          Henry looks up.

                          MAX
           (tugging the pulley)
           Three feet of it so far today. We'll make it.
          Henry goes to the open doors of the Armoire. The tunnel
          is deeper now and all lit up...

                         

          EXT. PARKING LOT BEHIND THE THEATRE - LATER

          Henry, Max and Joe make their way toward Joe's car.

                          JOE
           What do you think guys? If it's a boy do
           I cut him or not?

                          MAX
           Well, you know what they say, cleanliness
           is next to Godliness.

                          JOE
           What do you say, Henry?
          Before he can answer :

           92.

                         

                         

           VOICE (O.S.)
           I see you guys in the bank. I see you
           guys in the alley next to the bank.
          They turn. FRANK, the bank guard, is standing right
          there. He's in his street clothes.

                          FRANK
           Now I see you coming out of the theatre
           behind the bank.
          Frank sucks his teeth.

                          FRANK (CONT'D)
           I know what you're up to Gentlemen.
          Henry, Max and Joe look at each other. Frank moves
          closer. Checks around to make sure no one can hear them.

                          FRANK (CONT'D)
           And I want in.

                          MAX
           In on what?
          Frank snickers.

                          FRANK
           We can't talk here. Let's drive.
          Max looks at Henry.

                         

          INT. JOE'S CAR - DRIVING

          Joe's driving. Max is in the passenger seat. Henry in the
          back next to Frank.

                          HENRY
           What's on your mind, Frank?

                          FRANK
           The I.C.R.E. Indigenous Currency
           Retrieval and Exchange.
          They exchange glances.

                          FRANK (CONT'D)
           Once a month a truck goes to all our
           partner banks across the border in
           Canada, picks up all the currency and
           brings it back home.
          They're listening...

           93.

                         

                         

                          FRANK (CONT'D)
           I'd say on average eight to twelve
           million, held in our vault at First
           Buffalo for just a few hours before it's
           picked up for redistribution.
          Now they're paying attention.

                          FRANK (CONT'D)
           Only a bunch of fools would rob that bank
           any other time.
          A beat. He leans closer...

                          FRANK (CONT'D)
           I can give you that date. I can help with
           alarms. I can be your guy on the inside.

                          MAX
           Hypothetically say you were right about
           what we're up to...which you're not. But
           just say...why would you help us rob your
           bank?

                          FRANK
           I got my reasons.

                          JOE
           This sounds like a set-up, man --
          Frank grabs Joe. Glares into his eyes.

                          FRANK
           I don't fuck around, kid. I told you. I
           got my reasons.

                          MAX
           Well, forgive us, Frank. But we're going
           to need to hear them.
          A beat.

                          FRANK
           The wife got sick a few years ago.
           Insurance wouldn't pick up all the costs.
           So I went to the bank. They wouldn't help
           cover the difference. We were going to
           retire to the Loire valley.

                          (DARKLY)
           We had to use all our savings to cover
           the bills.

                          JOE

                          (GETTING IT)
           The man gave it to you, huh.

           94.

                         

                         

                          FRANK
           I spent everything we had -- then she
           died...thirty years I've been at that
           bank.

                          HENRY
           What was her name?

                          FRANK
           Annie. Her name was Annie.

                          HENRY
           I'm Sorry.
          The moment just hangs there...

                          FRANK
           November 23rd. The money's delivered at
           eight and picked up at midnight.
          He turns to Henry.

                          FRANK (CONT'D)
           I retire in two weeks. This is it.

                          (THEN)
           You set up the table. I make sure dinner
           arrives hot.

                         

          EXT. THEATRE - MORNING

          MAX and HENRY walk up to the theatre. They've got
          coffees. It's drizzling.
          They both look up.

                          HENRY
           Shit.
          ON THE MARQUEE : "Chekhov's `The Cherry Orchard'...Opens
          NOVEMBER 23rd, 8 PM"

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           Opening night.

                          MAX
           And?

                          HENRY
           That's soon.

                          MAX
           We're going to have pull some nights.
          Henry thinks...

                          HENRY
           Maybe we should wait. Do it closing
           night.

           95.

                         

                         
          Max turns.

                          MAX
           We can't. He's retiring. This is a one
           time deal.

                          (THEN)
           I told you there were going to be tests,
           Henry.
          Henry absorbs that. Looks at Max.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           You're going to have to leave her.

                          (BEAT)
           No looking back.

                          CUT TO :

                         

          EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

          AN AMBULANCE Peels into the drive. A PATIENT is wheeled
          inside.

                         

          INT. HOSPITAL, EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT


                         REVEAL HENRY
          Walking down a corridor toward a NURSE'S STATION at the
          far end.
          The doors open for him...he hesitates

                         HENRY'S POV
          DEBBIE in profile, smiling and talking to a seated
          receptionist who touches her very pregnant belly.
          Henry takes a step back, the doors close. He watches
          through the glass a moment...
          Debbie looks radiant. Peaceful. Happy.

                         HENRY
          Walks back outside again. It's as if he got all the
          answers he needed...

                         

          INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT

          Max and Joe are digging. Looks like they've been at it
          for hours - covered in dirt and sweat. Henry enters the
          tunnel.

                          MAX
           There he is!

           96.

                         

                         
          Henry picks up his shovel. Starts to dig. He goes at it
          hard.
          Max catches his mood.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           You okay, Henry?

                          HENRY
           No.
          He turns to Max.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           I'm not leaving her.

                          JOE
           Who?

                          MAX
           The girl --
          He throws down his shovel.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Now listen, Henry. You're digging this
           tunnel. And you're gonna rob that bank.
           You're gonna take the money and you're
           gonna put it in the car and we're gonna
           drive away.

                          (THEN)
           This is one thing. Julie is another
           thing. This is not that. That is not
           this. Understand?

                         ON HENRY

                          JOE
           Hey! I think I got something...
          Joe furiously digs his shovel into the caked-in dirt
          above his head. Suddenly the ceiling of dirt comes free
          burying Joe who struggles to get out.
          Above, from where the dirt once was, is the smooth
          surface of concrete. The bottom of the vault.

                          MAX
           We have arrived! Look at that.
          Joe gets to his feet - he looks dazed.

                         

          INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY

          Henry and Max are finished packing up the apartment.
          Henry looks out the window. A beautiful clear blue sky.

           97.

                         

                         

                          HENRY
           Not a cloud in the sky.

                          MAX
           So clear you can see tomorrow.

                          (THEN)
           You're a good man, Henry. Thank you.

                          HENRY
           You too, Max. Let's go.

                          CUT TO:

                         

          EXT. ORPHEUM THEATRE - NIGHT

          A line at the box office. THEATERGOERS mill around,
          waiting for friends or chatting, everyone anticipating a
          great evening of theatre.

                         

          INT. ORPHEUM THEATRE, GREEN ROOM - SAME TIME

          The cast, dressed for stage, is gathered in the green
          room, chatting nervously to one another.

          HENRY AND JULIE
          Standing on opposite sides of the room.
          Hush descends as DAREK walks in.

                          DAREK
           In this `American dream' of ours,
           everyone is happy and smiling, they have
           achieved their objectives...and yet in
           life there is only change, upheaval, the
           birth of the new...and that birth is
           painful.

                         ON JULIE
          avoiding Henry's gaze.

                          DAREK (CONT'D)
           Our play is about misery, disconnection,
           a future that we don't see hitting us
           like a train...but tonight, my players,
           we show them...that this not a future to
           fear!
          He leaves. The players applaud --

                          GAYEV

                          (THRILLED)
           Off the cushion in the corner ; double
           into the centre pocket!
          Everyone laughs.

           98.

                         

                         

                          SIMON
           Ten minutes people!

                         

          INT. JULIE'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

          Julie sits by her vanity finishing her make-up. A knock
          on the door.

                          JULIE
           Come in.
          Henry appears. She's surprised.

                          HENRY
           I want you to meet me in California.

                          JULIE
           Henry, we've been over this --

                          HENRY
           We're doing it tonight.
          She sits there...

                          JULIE
           What?

                          HENRY
           It's the only time we can get in the

                          VAULT --

                          JULIE
           Of course! Opening night. What else? Like
           I said, everything always fucks up --

                          HENRY
           Nothing's fucked up. If it's tonight or a
           month from now, what's the difference? I
           still want you to meet me.

                          JULIE
           Nothing's fucked up? Have you looked
           around recently? You're leaving. What
           about the goddamn play?

                          HENRY
           Arnold's coming back. Max arranged it
           already.

                          JULIE
           I'm sure he did.
          He approaches her...

                          HENRY
           I want us to be together.
          She laughs. That's so ridiculous to her.

           99.

                         

                         

                          JULIE
           We screwed a couple of times, Henry! So
           what?

                          HENRY
           You know that's not true --

                          JULIE
           No, really. A couple of times.

                          (THEN)
           Don't you get it? I don't want to be with
           you.
          That cuts him dead.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           You're a thief. Go rob your bank.
          A beat. He leaves.

                         

          INT. THEATRE - NIGHT

          Max helps seat some elderly people.

                          MAX
           Enjoy the show, folks!
          He checks his watch...it's two minutes to eight. He walks
          briskly up the aisle...

                         

          INT. FIRST BUFFALO BANK - NIGHT

          Frank watches through the glass doors out onto the empty
          street.
          He looks at his watch, sucks his teeth.

          INT. THEATER - SAME TIME


                         SIMON
          On a headset. Points to Henry.

                          SIMON
           Curtain!
          ON HENRY, watching the curtain start to rise...

          THE CURTAIN COMES UP TO REVEAL :

                         THE NURSERY
          a long white post-modern room. Sounds of wind. It's may
          but frosty.

           100.

                         

                         
          Through the windows. CHERRY TREES in full bloom which
          contrast with the stark modernity of the nursery set.
          They're BIG SCREEN projections on real tree trunks :
          LOPHAKIN enters with DUNYASHA, holding a candelabra.

                          LOPHAKIN
           Well, thank god the train is in. What
           time is it?

                          DUNYASHA
           (checks his watch)
           Almost two.
           (blowing out the candle)
           It's light already.
          Henry yawns and stretches.

                          LOPHAKIN
           The train's late. At least two hours.

          AN ARMORED BANK TRUCK
          Rounds a corner into view...

                         

          EXT. STREET - NIGHT

          ...pulls up right in front of the First Buffalo Bank.
          BERNIE and STAN jump out. Bernie knocks on the glass door.

                          BERNIE
           How you doin', Frank?
          He un-holsters his weapon, covers as Stan opens the back
          of the truck.
          Through the glass, Frank smiles.

                          FRANK
           Doin' good, Bernie. Real good.
          He sucks his teeth.

                         

          EXT. BACK DOOR - THEATRE

          Max bursts out the back door of the theatre, his walk
          turning into a run...

                         

          INT. THEATRE - SAME TIME

          Julie as Madame Ranevksy enters the nursery in rapt
          delight.

           101.

                         

                         

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           My nursery, my dear, beautiful, sweet
           nursery! This is where I used to sleep
           when I was a little girl!
          Henry as Lophakin turns to face her, waiting for her to
          say hello...instead she breezes past him.

           MADAME RANEVSKY (CONT'D)
           I'm still like a little girl...
          She kisses Gayev and Varya and then Gayev again. She
          kisses everyone in fact, except Lophakin.

                          GAYEV
           Your train was two hours late. How do you
           explain that? Is that good management?

                         

          INT. BANK - SAME TIME

          Bernie breaks the seal of an envelope, hands it to Stan.
          Frank unlocks the plastic casing to the VAULT KEYPAD for
          Stan who punches in the CODES on the slip of paper that
          was inside the envelope.
          Frank reaches into his pocket. We glimpse his phone. He
          presses `SEND'...

                         

          EXT. POWER POLE - SAME TIME

          Max struggles to the top of a telephone pole by an open
          electrical box. His cell phone vibrates. He pulls it out,
          reads it.

                         "YOU"
          He unzips a fanny pack, pulls out a WIRE CUTTER, but his
          hands are trembling and he drops it...
          Thirty feet to the ground.

          CRACK!

                          MAX
           Shit.

                         

          INT. STAGE - SAME TIME

          Standing next to Simon, Henry watches Julie perform from
          the side of the stage.

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           Oh, my childhood, my innocent childhood!
           I used to sleep in this nursery.

                          (MORE)

           102.

           MADAME RANEVSKY (CONT'D)
           I looked out from here into the garden. I
           woke up happy every morning.

                          HENRY
           Isn't she beautiful?

                          SIMON
           Yes.
          She looks out toward the window through which there is
          now a projection of the ORCHARD, this time in autumnal
          decay...

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           Oh, my cherry orchard...

                         

          INT. BANK - SAME TIME


                         ON FRANK
          Waiting...as he and Bernie watch Stan load the money into
          the vault.

                          BERNIE
           You ever think what you could do with all
           that money, Frank?

                          STAN
           I know what you'd do. Buy the Bills and
           put them in first place.

                          BERNIE
           You'd need a lot more money than that.
           But I guarantee you I'd have them back in
           the Super Bowl within two seasons.

                          STAN
           Perfect. Another chance to lose.
          Frank laughs nervously.

                         

          EXT. ALLEY - SAME TIME

          Max picks up the wire cutters off the ground, checks his
          watch. His heart jumps. He starts up the pole again.
          Finally reaches the top. Struggles to find the right wire.

                          MAX
           Oh god, oh god. Where are you, you little
           pischer?
          He finally finds the right one and CUTS IT :

           103.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. BANK - SAME TIME

          Bernie and Stan place the last of the money in the vault.

                          BERNIE
           We're good.
          Bernie closes the vault.

                         

          INT. BANK - SAME TIME

          Stan returns to the keypad. Begins pecking in the re-
          arming code --

                         

          EXT. POWER POLE - SAME TIME

          AS Max quickly attaches the CIRCUIT BYPASS WIRE...

                         

          INT. BANK - SAME TIME

          Stan completes the code. Just as he's about to hit the
          `Enter' button --

                         

          EXT. POWER POLE - SAME TIME

          Max CLIPS the bypass onto the other side of the wire and
          the NUMBERS START TO COME UP.

                         

          INT. BANK - SAME TIME

          Stan hits `enter' -- the vault CLANKS again. Locked. A
          RED LIGHT indicates the alarm is on.

                         

          EXT. POWER POLE - SAME TIME

          Max looks at the screen. ALL THE NUMBERS MATCH. The red
          light turns GREEN.
          He sighs, relieved.

           LOPHAKIN (O.S.)
           I saw this excellent piece of theatre
           yesterday. Really very funny.

           104.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. STAGE - NIGHT -- SAME TIME


                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           I'm sure it wasn't in the least funny. I
           believe people like you should examine
           their own lives instead of going to the
           theatre to observe other peoples!

                          LOPHAKIN
           True enough. To be honest. We live a
           stupid life.

                         

          EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF BANK - SAME TIME

          Frank, Stan and Bernie are by the truck.

                          STAN
           Well this is it, Frank.

                          BERNIE
           We got you something.

                          STAN
           A little retirement gift.
          Bernie produces a neatly wrapped gift.

                          STAN (CONT'D)
           Go ahead. Open it.
          Frank does. It's a bag of coffee.

                          FRANK
           Thanks guys.

                          BERNIE
           We wanted to get you something from
           France.

                          STAN
           You like French Roast, right?

                          FRANK
           Thanks.

                          (THEN)
           You know this isn't from France.

                          BERNIE
           What are you talking about? It's French
           roast.

                          FRANK
           Right. But over there they call it coffee.

                          STAN
           (slightly baffled, at Bernie)
           But this is French roast...

           105.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. TUNNEL - SAME TIME

          Joe and Eddie in the tunnel, waiting. Eddie looks at his
          watch.

                          EDDIE
           Where is he? Where's that old man?

                         

          EXT. BACKSTAGE DOOR - SAME TIME

          Max pulls open the door, sweating, runs inside...
          straight into Julie.

                          MAX
           Julie -- Break a leg!

                          JULIE
           Play's already started, Max.
          She walks past him.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           Good-bye confidence man.

                          MAX
           Good-bye, Julie.

                         

          INT. HENRY'S DRESSING ROOM AREA - SAME TIME

          Max hurries down the stairs, rushes into Henry's dressing
          room.

                         

          INT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

          Max opens the armoire, looks inside to a waiting Joe and

                         EDDIE --

                          MAX
           Go! Go! Go!

                          EDDIE
           About time, old man.

                          MAX
           Do your job.
          Joe leans over and pukes on the ground.

                          EDDIE
           Jesus! Not again! What is it with you?

                          JOE
           Sorry.

           106.

                         

                         
          Eddie looks at him.

                          EDDIE
           You're a pussy, Joe, you know that?
          Eddie grabs the drill. Starts to make a hole. Joe starts
          to prepare the charges...

                         

          INT. THEATRE - NIGHT

          Lophakin and Madame Ranevsky perform.

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           Well, what should we do? Tell us what to do?

                          LOPHAKIN
           I tell you every day. Every day I say the
           same thing over and over. You must rent
           out the Cherry Orchard and the rest of
           the Estate for villas. At once, right
           this second, the auction is coming up
           very soon --
          A muffled BOOM (o.s.)
          Henry freezes. Julie looks at him.

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           It's all so vulgar!
          Another muffled BOOM (o.s.) this time the audience looks
          around. Julie glares at him.

                         

          INT. TUNNEL ROOM - NIGHT

          Henry rushes in to the tunnel to find Joe and Max staring
          at the underside of the steel bank vault. It's like a
          gleaming jewel.

                          MAX
           That was good, kid. Good acting.

                          JOE
           (a little giddy)
           There she is.
          Henry reaches up, touches the steel vault bottom, rubs
          it.

                          EDDIE
           Get out of there!
          Eddie arrives in his protection suit, holding a thermite
          burning tool.

                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           This shit comes straight from hell.

           107.

                         

                         
          They scramble out. He puts his protective helmet on.
          Lights it. It's like an inferno

                         

          INT. TUNNEL - SAME TIME


          WHITE HEAT AND SPARKS
          EDDIE's manic face behind the mask, a man possessed,
          screaming, a river of molten steel dripping down right in
          front of him.
          KRUUUNK! The bottom of the vault drops onto the ground.

                         

          INT. TUNNEL - A MINUTE LATER

          Smoke clears to reveal EDDIE. He pulls off his hood.

                          EDDIE
           Welcome to my world, bitches.
          They all look up at THE HOLE.

                          JOE
           Fuck, yeah.

                         ON HENRY

                         

          INT. VAULT - A FEW MINUTES LATER

          as his head rises into view through the newly cut hole.
          He climbs in and touches the saran-wrapped STACK OF CASH,
          subdivided into bricks.
          He sits on it. Thinking...
          It's dead quiet in here.
          Max pops his head up. Stares at the cash :

                          MAX

                          (SMILING)
           You're on, Henry!

           MADAME RANEVSKY (O.S.)
           Is the cherry orchard sold?

                         

          INT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS

          Audience's POV as Madame Ranevsky faces Lophakin on the
          other side of the stage. It's like a showdown.

                          LOPHAKIN
           Yes.

           108.

                         

                         

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           Who bought it?
          Pause.

                          LOPHAKIN
           I did.
          Madame Ranevsky is overwhelmed by the news. Varya takes
          her keys and throws them on the floor. Exits in a rage.

                          LOPHAKIN (CONT'D)
           I bought it. Wait a minute ; don't rush
           me. I'm all dizzy. I can't talk...

                         

          INT. VAULT -- SAME TIME


          EDDIE, JOE AND MAX
          Stuff duffel bags full of cash.

                          JOE
           Deb's gonna freak.

                         

          INT. STAGE - NIGHT

          Lophakin swirls on stage...

                          LOPHAKIN
           ...and now the Cherry Orchard is mine.
           Mine!

                          (LAUGHING)
           God! God in heaven. The Cherry Orchard is
           mine! Tell me I'm drunk, tell me I'm out
           of my mind, tell me I'm dreaming!

                         

          INT. TUNNEL ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER


          EDDIE, JOE AND MAX
          Finish lining up the duffels of cash by the door.

                          MAX
           That's everything.

                          EDDIE
           Yes, it is.
          Max freezes, suddenly notices Eddie is standing there
          with A GUN pointed at him and Joe.

                          MAX
           What's that, Eddie?

           109.

                         

                         

                          EDDIE
           It's a gun, Max.
          Max doesn't seem so surprised.

                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           (with the gun)
           Joe! Take the money out back to my car.
          Joe doesn't move. Eddie waves the gun.

                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           Joe!
          Max boldly steps right in front of the gun.

                          MAX
           Stay right where you are, Joe.
          Eddie puts the gun to Max's stomach.

                          EDDIE
           Don't be stupid, Max.

                          MAX
           You're not going to do this, Eddie.
          Eddie smiles.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           You can shoot me dead if you want, but
           you're going to have to shoot me dead.
          Eddie PUNCHES Max in the gut, then pops him in the head
          as he throws him back.

                          EDDIE
           I'm not playing with you, old man.

                          JOE
           What are you doing, Eddie?
          The door swings open -- HENRY -- walks in on the scene...

                          EDDIE
           Welcome to the party, Brando.
          Seeing the gun, Henry freezes at the door. Eddie's in the
          middle, Max and Joe by the mouth of the tunnel, Max on
          the floor, a gash on his forehead from Eddie's blow.

                          HENRY
           What are you doing, Eddie?
          Eddie turns at him.

                          EDDIE
           It's money, Henry. Money.

           110.

                         

                         

                          MAX
           This was your chance you idiot. You
           could've been a better man but you did it
           again. You messed up. And now you're back
           with the maggots. Just one big missed
           opportunity.
          Eddie kicks him again.

                          JOE
           Yeah. Come on, Eddie. We're here. We're
           done. He's right. Come on, man.

                          EDDIE
           Shut up, Joe. Get the money. Put it in
           the car. Shut up.
          He turns back to Henry.

                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           Now move, Torne. No happy ending for you.
          He gestures to the tunnel.
          Joe suddenly turns back, grabs Eddie's gun hand from
          behind. THE GUN GOES OFF. They wrestle. Joe bites Eddie's
          hand.

                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           You animal!
          Max, straddling Eddie, grabs his head, bangs it on the

                         GROUND :

                          MAX
           Famach deh mohl! Gey lig mitt'n vahntzin
           son of a bitch!
          Henry, a little dazed, picks up the gun.

                          JOE

                          (TO HENRY)
           Get the extension chord.
          He does. They roll Eddie over, start to hog tie his hands
          then his legs.
          Eddie starts to freak out.

                          EDDIE
           You couldn't have done this without me.

                          MAX
           Our new partner. Huh.
          Max stuffs a glove into Eddie's mouth but Eddie still
          kicks like crazy.
          Max notices Henry's thigh.

           111.

                         

                         

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           You ok?
          Henry sees it now too. It's a graze.

                          HENRY
           I got shot.
          Henry hears the tannoy. It's his cue. He's late.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           I gotta get on stage.
          He rushes out...

                         

          INT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS

          On stage, the lights come up revealing a LINE OF HOODED
          FACELESS FIGURES standing behind the scrim, axes by their
          side.
          They walk out onto the stage...

                          GAYEV
           Thank you, my friends, thank you.
          Lophakin rushes on stage. He's late. Yasha, holding a
          tray with small tumblers of champagne, shoots him a look.
          Madame Ranevsky enters from the other side, hands out
          cash to the line of hooded figures.

                          YASHA
           The peasants have come to say good-bye.

                          (THEN)
           They're good fellows, Yermolai
           Aleksayovich but in my opinion a little
           stupid...

                          GAYEV
           (to Madame Ranevsky)
           You gave them everything in your purse,
           Lyuba. Wrong, quite wrong!

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           I couldn't help it. I couldn't help it.
          Gayev and Madame Ranevsky walk past Lophakin, ignoring
          him on their way out.

                          LOPHAKIN
           (still a little out of

                          BREATH)
           Won't you please come here and drink a
           glass as a good-bye?

           112.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. TUNNEL - SAME TIME

          Eddie, gagged and bound, lies in the middle of the tunnel
          as Max closes the door to the dressing room.

                          MAX
           Old man, huh.
          Eddie tries to scream but he can't. As Max shuts the door
          all light is blotted out.

          THE PEASANTS/HOODED FIGURES
          positioned now by the cherry trees behind the scrim and
          back-lit.

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           We're going and not a soul will be here
           until after we're gone.

                          LOPHAKIN
           Until spring.
          She notices he's clutching his thigh...

                         

          EXT. THEATRE - SAME TIME

          Max and Joe load the last of the duffels filled with cash
          into the back of Joe's car...
          They get inside. Joe starts the engine...

                          JOE
           Where is he?

                          MAX
           Any minute now.

                         

          INT. STAGE - SAME TIME


                          ANYA
           Goodbye, home! Goodbye to the old life!

                          TROFIMOV
           Hello to the new life!
          Trofimov exits with Anya. Varya looks around the room and
          exits. Yasha and Carlotta exit with the dog.
          Lophakin to Madame Ranevsky and Gayev :

                          LOPHAKIN
           Until the spring, then. Goodbye my
           friends, until we meet again!

           113.

                         

                         

                         ON HENRY
          As he and Julie exchange a final look. She watches him
          go...it's as if he's moving in slow motion...

                          GAYEV
           My sister! My sister!

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           Oh, my dear, sweet, lovely orchard! My
           life, my youth, my happiness, farewell!
           Farewell!

           ANYA (O.S.)
           Mamma!

           TROFIMOV (O.S.)
           Aa-oo!

                         

          EXT. THEATRE - MOMENTS LATER

          Henry comes out the back door. Gets in the car.

                          MAX
           How's the leg?

                          HENRY
           It's fine. Go.
          Joe guns it.

                         ON HENRY
          Sitting in the back.

                          CUT TO :

                         

          INT. STAGE -- SAME TIME

          The Peasants/hooded figures raise their axes. They
          suddenly have the manner of executioners...
          They stand ready to fell Madame Ranevsky's beloved
          orchard.

                          JULIE
           (as Madame Ranevsky)
           One last look at these walls, these
           windows...Dear mother used to love to
           walk about in this room.

                          GAYEV
           My sister! My sister!

           ANYA (O.S.)
           Mamma!

           114.

                         

                         

           TROFIMOV (V.O.)
           Aa-oo!

                          JULIE
           (as Madame Ranevsky)
           We're coming.
          The sound of the HOODED FIGURES as they chop the trees
          behind her. It's horrific.
          Madame Ranevsky holds her hands over her ears and falls
          to the ground...and begins to weep...

                         

          INT. CAR - SAME TIME


                          HENRY
           Stop the car!

                          MAX
           Henry!

                          HENRY
           Joe, stop the car.

                          MAX
           He can't stop the car, it's the getaway!

                          JOE
           Yeah, you can't --

                          HENRY

           STOP THE FUCKING CAR!
          Joe screeches to a halt. Henry gets out of the car.

                          MAX
           What the hell are you doing?
          Henry starts to run back toward the theatre as best he
          can...
          Max sticks his head out the window.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Henry!
          But he's already gone...

                         

          INT. STAGE - SAME TIME

          The HOODED FIGURES finish destroying the orchard. TREES
          litter the stage...
          Madame Ranevsky still holds her hands over her ears on
          the ground...

           115.

                         

                         
          As the cacophony ends, she gets up slowly and turns to
          walk off the stage...

                         SHE FREEZES :

          RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER
          Coming down the aisle is
          HENRY as LOPHAKIN
          Pause.
          He comes closer. He's limping slightly....

                          LOPHAKIN
           I had to come back. I couldn't get on the
           train. The moment I stepped on the
           platform, the blood drained from my
           heart.
          ON JULIE, in shock.

                          LOPHAKIN (CONT'D)
           I knew I might never see you again.
          He steps up on the stage...

                         ON DAREK

                          DAREK
           What is he doing? Why is Lophakin back?!

                         ON HENRY

                          LOPHAKIN
           I had to come back.

                          MADAME RANEVSKY

                          (A WHISPER)
           Henry, what is this? What are you doing?

                          LOPHAKIN
           This is the only way you'll listen to me.
          She looks out to the audience. EAGER FACES awaiting
          Madame Ranevsky's response...

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           You should have gotten on that stupid
           train. You made a mistake.

                          LOPHAKIN
           The mistake would have been getting on that
           train without telling you how I feel.

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           Ha! Don't pretend you care about me. All
           you care about is money.

           116.

                         

                         
          She tries to get past him. He blocks her.

                          LOPHAKIN
           You think this is about money?

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           Yes.
          He grabs her.

                          HENRY
           It's never been about money. You know
           that.

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           Let go of me!

                          LOPHAKIN
           No.

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           Damn it! Just leave, Henry!
           (under her breath)
           Get off the fucking stage --

                          HENRY
           Take a chance. Meet me in Moscow.

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           No, I'm perfectly happy here.

                          HENRY
           That's not true. Meet me in Moscow.
          She tries to get away again...

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           Let me go!

                          HENRY
           I can't.
          Pause.

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           Why are you doing this?

                          LOPHAKIN
           You're just afraid.

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           I'm not afraid of anything --
          She kicks out at him.

           MADAME RANEVSKY (CONT'D)
           What am I afraid of Henry? Tell me!

           117.

                         

                         

                          LOPHAKIN
           You're afraid because I love you.
          That hits her. Pause. She breaks away from him, stepping
          back...

                         SHOCKED ACTORS
          On the side of the stage.

                         ON JULIE

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           ...what?
          She searches his expression now...

                          HENRY
           Meet me in Moscow.
          She can't move. The audience is rapt.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)

                          (SOFTLY)
           Tell me you'll meet me in Moscow.
          There are tears in her eyes now...

                          AUDIENCE MEMBER
           Go with him!

           ANOTHER AUDIENCE MEMBER
           Meet him in Moscow!

                         DAREK
          at the back of the theatre. Stunned :

                          DAREK

                          (TO SIMON)
           He loves her.

          JULIE AND HENRY
          She whispers softly. Looks down at his leg.

                          JULIE
           Henry. You're bleeding.

                          HENRY
           I know.

          IN THE BACK
          Darek is alive once more...

           118.

                         

                         

                          DAREK
           (whisper to Simon)
           Lights down ten. Down ten more. Slowly...
          Julie and Henry in silhouette now.

                          JULIE
           Oh, fuck, Henry...
          The lights fade, as an image of WHITE CHERRY BLOSSOMS
          appears on the projection screen...

                          FADE DOWN :

          EXT. THE LOIRE VALLEY, FRANCE - DAY

          ...which become REAL BLOSSOMS on a CHERRY TREE, widening
          to reveal an orchard, the most beautiful you've ever
          seen.

          A STONE FARM HOUSE
          Frank sits at a table outside in the garden. He pours
          himself a Pernod. He looks happy as a clam.
          A CAT jumps in his lap, purring.

                          FRANK
           Hello miou-miou.
          He looks out at the lush valley below. Smiles.

                          CUT TO :

          THE SOUND OF A CRYING BABY

                         

          INT. PRIVATE DELIVERY ROOM, SOMEWHERE IN NEW MEXICO -


                         DAWN
          A state of the art hospital room. No expense has been
          spared. A shaky image of DEB's face as JOE frames the
          video camera.
          THE BABY comes into view now. It's beautiful. And
          screaming its little lungs out.

           JOE (O.S.)
           It's a girl!!!

                          DEBBIE
           A girl.

           119.

                         

                         
          A NURSE hands the baby to Debbie. Joe looks on, tears
          stream down his face.

                          CUT TO :

                         

          EXT. FORT LAUDERDALE - DAY

          We follow A MAILMAN past a row of palm trees as he enters
          a traditional-looking BARBER SHOP : "MAX'S - A PLACE FOR

                         GROOMING"

                         

          INT. MAX'S BARBER SHOP - CONTINUOUS

          The Mailman hands a few letters to the pretty front desk
          GIRL. Max, his back to us, finishes a shave, talking his
          customer's ear off.

                          MAX
           Time is a medium of exchange. You can buy
           things with it. Education. Self-respect.
           You can even figure out your dream.
          The Guy nods. Max turns. We see him now. He's super tan.
          He pulls the sheet off his client.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           You're done. Next!
          Another YOUNG CUSTOMER sits down. There's a few of them
          waiting their turn, enjoying Max's schtick.
          The front desk girl hands Max the mail.
          CLOSE ON A POSTCARD : `Our dream is our truth is our
          destiny...Love H... xx'
          Max smiles. Flips over the postcard and only now when he
          pins it above the mirror do we finally see what it is --
          an image of THE HOLLYWOOD SIGN.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           So tell me, Javier. What's your dream?

          THE SOUND OF BREATHING
          Fade up on : what looks like the AFRICAN BUSH.
          It's hot. There are insects buzzing around and it doesn't
          look like rain's landed anywhere near here in years.
          A HAND reaches out for another HAND, helping someone over
          the final step.

          REVEAL HENRY AND JULIE
          Sitting right below the Hollywood sign now...

           120.

                         

                         
          Looking down on the whole basin of Los Angeles. She hands
          him a bottle of water. He drinks.

                          JULIE
           Look. You can see the ocean.
          He puts his arm around her.

                          HENRY
           `Your brother says I'm an upstart, a
           money grubber...but I don't care a bit.'
          She laughs...they kiss in the sun for a while...

                         

          FADE TO BLACK

          CREDITS START TO ROLL...

                         

          INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - BUFFALO - DAY

          EDDIE VIBES is being questioned by the unseen DETECTIVE.

           DETECTIVE (O.S.)
           I'm only going to ask you one more time,
           Eddie. Who was it? Who helped you?

                          EDDIE
           I told you before. Dopey. Sleepy. Happy
           and Doc --
          WHAACK! The slap knocks Eddie to the ground. He's under
          the table now, his face crushed by the Detective's BOOT :

           DETECTIVE (O.S.)
           You know what you are Vibes? A liar, a
           cheat, a thief and a loser.
          He presses his boot down harder ON EDDIE'S FACE :

                          EDDIE
           I may be all those things but one thing
           I'm not...is a rat.
          Eddie smiles. His face squashed sideways like that, it's
          a pretty strange kind of smile...

        FADE IN:
                         
          1 INT. NICK'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT 1
                         
           Looking incredibly weary, NICK WATERS, 30's, enters his
           apartment in his business suit. He stumbles into --
                         
                         
          2 INT. NICK'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 2
                         
           He drops his briefcase, strips off his jacket, loosens
           his tie and collapses onto the bed like a dead man. PAN
           OVER TO the alarm clock which reads "1:23 AM."
                         
           MATCH CUT TO:
                         
                         
          3 INT. NICK'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING 3
                         
           The alarm clock now reads "4:59 AM." It switches to
           "5:00" and a BLARING BUZZER goes off. Nick sits up in
           bed, shuts off the buzzer and painfully forces himself
           out of bed. He hurries out of the bedroom, passing the
           saddest, deadest houseplant in history.
                         
                         
          4 INT. NICK'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 4
                         
           Nick opens his fridge to reveal a wasteland of moldy
           leftover containers and crusty condiments. The orange
           juice container he grabs is empty.
                         
                          NICK
           Damn.
                         
           He opens the freezer. It contains nothing but multiple
           boxes of "Jimmy Dean's Breakfast Bowl -- with Bacon!" He
           pops one in the microwave, then glances over at a framed
           photo of a slightly younger Nick kissing a smiling OLD
           WOMAN on the cheek. The frame reads: "I Y Grandma!"
           Nick sighs sadly.
                         
                         
          5 INT. NICK'S BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER 5
                         
           Nick sits on the toilet eating his breakfast bowl with a
           fork. He takes some toilet paper from the roll and wipes
           his mouth with it.
                         
                         
          6 INT. NICK'S SHOWER - MOMENTS LATER 6
                         
           Nick showers while simultaneously brushing his teeth and
           shaving. He loses track and brushes his face with the
           toothbrush.
           2.
                         
                         
          7 INT. NICK'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER 7
                         
           Nick hastily grabs work clothes from his messy drawers
           and closet. Clearly, no laundry has been done in a
           while.
                         
                         
          8 INT. NICK'S APARTMENT ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER 8
                         
           Nick hurriedly buttons his shirt, tucks it in and begins
           tying his tie as the elevator reaches the lobby.
                         
                         
          9 INT. NICK'S CAR - SHORT TIME LATER 9
                         
           As he drives to work, he dials a number and transfers it
           to speakerphone.

                          NICK
                          (CHEERY)
           Hey, Jenna, it's Nick.
                         
           JENNA (V.O.)
           It's five-thirty in the morning,
           Nick.
                         
                          NICK
           Yeah, sorry. This is like the
           only time I have to make any
           personal calls. I just wanted to
           see if you felt like going out
           again because I had a great time
           with you on our last date.
                         
           JENNA (V.O.)
           Our last date was two weeks ago.
           You haven't called me since.
                         
                          NICK
           I know and that's my bad. I've
           been swamped at work --
                         
           JENNA (V.O.)
           Yeah, I remember. Work was all
           you talked about when we went out.
                         
                          NICK
           Right. Well, I'm up for a
           promotion which will give me a lot
           more free time --

           Listen, I'm actually seeing
           someone. And even if I weren't,
           the last thing I need is some
           career-obsessed guy complaining
           about work all the time. See you
           around, Nick.
                         
           She hangs up.
                         
                         
          10 EXT. COMMTRONIX INDUSTRIES - SHORT TIME LATER 10
                         
           A soulless four-story building in a drab office park.
           Nick exits his car and runs full-speed to the entrance.

           Nick bursts through the doors and looks at his watch. It
           reads "6:02." He looks up at a security camera with a
           flashing red light, indicating he is on tape.
                         
                          NICK
           Fuck!

           Nick sits at his desk inputting information from a large
           PILE of documents into a spreadsheet on his computer.
           The clock on his computer turns to "8:00 AM."
                         
           HARKEN (O.S.)
           Nick.
                         
           Nick jumps, startled. He turns to see his boss, DAVE
           HARKEN, 40's, standing behind him.
                         
                          NICK
           Yes?

           of the lobby security camera footage on a television.
           The time code at the bottom of the screen reads "6:02."
           We see Nick looking up at the camera and silently
           mouthing the word "Fuck!" The image freezes and we PULL
           BACK to see Harken holding the remote. Nick stands
           across from him.
                         
                          HARKEN
           Here's my concern, Nick. You're a
           punctual guy. You understand the
           importance of getting to work on
           time. So that leaves me to wonder
           if there isn't something wrong
           with the internal clock in our
           security system. What do you
           think?
                         
                          NICK
           I don't know, Mr. Harken. I might
           have been a minute late.
                         
                          HARKEN
           Two minutes according to this. So
           either you're a liar -- which I
           know you're not -- or our system
           is off by a full minute. And if
           that's the case, I have no choice
           but to dismiss Thomas, our
           longtime security coordinator.
                         
                          NICK
           Okay, I might have been two
           minutes late.
                         
           There's an uncomfortable beat. Then --
                         
                          HARKEN
           So you did lie.
                         
                          NICK
           No, I --
                         
           Harken picks up the phone.

           Trust is everything in this
           office, my friend. I know you've
           been working your tail off for
           that promotion, but if I can't

           Oh. Well, I only took it because
           I thought you were having one.

           A car pulls up outside the modest building.

           STACY, cute, 30's, is dropping off DALE STEVENS, 30's,
           who wears the scrubs of a dental hygienist.
                         
                          STACY
           Boy, I have to get used to driving
           with this heavy ring on. I keep
           swerving to the left.

           Stacy drives off. Dale steels himself for what lies
           ahead, then goes inside.
                         
                         
          21 INT. DENTAL OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 21
                         
           Dale enters the waiting room, passing a few PATIENTS. He
           grabs a mask and goggles from a supply room, then heads
                          INTO --

           Dale finds his boss, DR. JULIA HARRIS, 30's, sexy but
           with something a little off, hovering over a patient, MR.
           ANDERTON, 50's. Dale seems visibly uneasy.
                         
                          JULIA
           All right, Mr. Anderton, I'm going
           to give you the nitrous now and
           your root canal will be over
           before you know it.
                          (TO DALE)
           Dale? Please.
                         
           Dale turns the valve on the tank and soon Mr. Anderton's
           eyes roll back in his head. Julia shuts the door, picks
           up a drill and begins boring into the patient's molar.
                         
                          JULIA

           Dale sighs and looks down at the unconscious Mr.
           Anderton. This obviously isn't the first time Julia has
           spoken this way.

           She lifts the patient's limp hand and cups it over her
           breast.

           "Barnes & Noble girl," "Lauren? Laura?," "Blonde Chick"

                          KURT
           Last quarter's profits? I ran the
           numbers. We're down by 11 percent
           year-to-year.

           No way. These people have worked
           their asses off for me. There's
           no reason they should suffer.
                         
           Kurt looks at his boss with admiration. There's a lot of

           There's also the issue of our
           hazardous waste disposal. We're
           paying a lot right now and the
           Bolivians have come back with a
           very good offer.
                         
                          JACK
           You know why it's good? Because
           they'll dump our chemicals in
           rivers, pollute water supplies and
           hurt people. I've spent my life
           building this company.

           PELLIT, late-20s, weasely-looking, sniffing a bit too
           much and rubbing his nose repeatedly. There's something

           if you want something done right,
           you do it yourself. So, I'm going

           between my office and what
           would've been the Senior VP's to
           create a single, enormous office.
           However, as a cost-cutting
           measure, I will only be taking 85%
           of the additional salary I'm

           suit.
                         
           PELLIT (O.S.)
           Yo, dickwall! What the fuck?
                         
           Kurt sees Bobby Pellit standing in the doorway of what
           was Jack's office.
                         
                          KURT
           What?
                         
                          PELLIT
           You're three hours late. What's
           the deal?
                         
                          KURT
           I was at your father's funeral.
                         
                          PELLIT
           Maybe that excuse would've flown
           when my dad was here, but I'm in
           charge now.
                         
                          KURT
           That excuse wouldn't have made any
           sense when your dad was here.
                         
                          PELLIT
           In my office. Now.

          31 INT. PELLIT'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 31
                         
           Kurt enters. He notices that the "Jack Pellit" nameplate
           has been partially taped over with the name "Bobby"
           scribbled in magic marker.
                         
                          PELLIT
           Sit.
                         
           Kurt sits. Bobby quickly slips a small mirror and rolled
           up dollar bill into a drawer. Kurt sees Bobby has tossed
           most of Jack's mementos, achievement awards and photos
           with luminaries in the trash.
                         
                          PELLIT
           I've been looking over the books.
           You're the accountant. Tell me
           why this company is in the
           crapper.
                         
                          KURT
           It's not in the crapper. It's a
           recession. But we're still
           profitable.
                         
                          PELLIT
           Bullshit. Look, I know you and my
           dad were pals. Frankly, I always
           thought it was weird and gay and I
           never understood why my dad
           thought you were so great. But it
           doesn't matter now because he's in
           the ground and I'm your boss. And
           there's gonna be some changes
           around here. First of all...
           (pointing to a
                          BALANCE SHEET)
           What is this `EnviroTech Waste
           Management' shit that we're paying
           so much for?
                         
                          KURT
           Your father made the decision to
           pay a little more to dispose of
           our chemical waste responsibly.
                         
                          PELLIT
           Yeah, fuck that. We've got an
           offer from Bolivia to dump the
           stuff for a third the cost.
                         
                          KURT
           But that would endanger thousands
           of local residents.

           So some jungle tribesmen get
           cancer. Boo friggin' hoo.
                         
                          KURT
           They're not tribesmen. It's a
                          MODERN --
                          (THEN)
           Look, Bobby, your dad told me very
           clearly he'd die before he'd save
           money by hurting people.
                         
                          PELLIT
           Well then, we're right on
           schedule, aren't we?
                         
           Kurt's eyes narrow. He reaches into the trash can and
           grabs one of Jack's discarded ACHIEVEMENT TROPHIES and
           PLUNGES its pointy end deep into Pellit's chest, impaling
           him in his chair.
                         
           SMASH CUT TO:

           Kurt sits across from an unharmed Pellit.
                         
                          PELLIT
           Oh, and we also need to trim the
           fat around here.
                         
                          KURT
           (snapping out of it)
           What do you mean?
                         
                          PELLIT
           I want you to fire the fat people.
           They're slow and lazy and they
           make me sad to look at. Start
           with Large Marge.
                         
           ANGLE ON Margie at her desk.
                         
                          KURT
           Margie's not fat. She's pregnant.
           I'm not firing her.
                         
                          PELLIT
           Fine. Then fire Professor Xavier
           over there.
                         
           ANGLE ON a balding, middle-aged man in a wheelchair,
           HANK, who sits at a desk near Margie's.

                          PELLIT
           He creeps me out. Rolling around
           in that weird little chair of his.
                         
                          KURT
           I'm not firing anyone! It's like
           you don't care about this company
           at all.
                         
                          PELLIT
           No shit. You think when I was a
           kid I dreamed of running a fucking
           chemical company? No. I dreamed
           of retiring. Of being fed
           tropical fruit on a beach by a
           model while she blows me. And as
           soon as I squeeze all the profit
           out of this place, that's exactly
           what I'm gonna do. So here's the
           deal. You either fire the fatty
           or the cripple, or I fire both of
           them.

           Kurt sighs as he looks from Margie to Hank and back. At
           last, he gathers his resolve and crosses to Hank's desk.
           From a RESPECTFUL DISTANCE we watch as Kurt breaks the
           news to Hank who reacts with sad resignation.
                         
           Kurt turns to see Pellit standing directly beside him.
                         
                          PELLIT
           (loudly, to the room)
           Everyone, can I have your
           attention please? I've just
           learned that Kurt has fired our
           dear friend Hank here. I want you
           to know that I am as surprised and
           angry about this as you are.
                         
                          KURT
           What are you -- ?!
                         
                          PELLIT
           This is entirely an accounting
           department decision. My hands are
           tied.
           (then, to Kurt)
           You are one heartless bastard,

           Hank wheels away, leaving Kurt to face the angry looks of
           his CO-WORKERS.

           Dale, dressed for work, knocks on Julia's office door.

           He looks up to find Julia sitting at her desk in nothing
           but an unbuttoned white lab coat.

           Yes, I like to joke around at
           work. And sometimes I might cross
           the line a bit. But the last
           thing I want to do is make you

           Let's cut to the chase. You're
           engaged now. And I respect the
           institution of marriage too much
           to violate it. That's why you
           need to fuck me well before the
           wedding. Because the closer it
           gets, the less ladylike I'm going
           to feel about this whole thing.

           you guys and your drunk bullshit.

           If it's bullshit, Dale, then how
           come we all want to do it so much?
                         
           They reach the corner where they part ways.
                         
                          DALE
           I don't want to do it. And when
           you sober up neither will you.
           We're not killing anyone.
                         
           Dale heads off.

           I knew you only brought her in

           Kurt and Dale wait in the car outside of Nick's office.
                         
                          KURT
           We're outside. You ready for a
           little recon?
                         
                          NICK
           Yeah. I just need to get Harken
           to let me leave early.
                         
                          KURT
           What's the difference? He's not
           going to be your boss much longer.
                         
                          NICK
                          (WHISPERING)
           If I get fired before we kill
           Harken, this'll all have been for
           nothing. I'll just be an out-of-
           work murderer.
                          (THEN)
           I'll be down in three minutes.
                         
           He hangs up then peers over his cubicle wall to see
           Harken talking to another EMPLOYEE nearby. Nick takes a
           breath, leans over his garbage pail and sticks a
           Commtronix pen down his throat. At the sound of Nick's
           loud WRETCHING, Harken looks over to see him puking into
           the trash pail.
                         
                          HARKEN
           What in God's name...?!
                         
                          NICK
                          (WEAKLY)
           Sorry, sir. I've been fighting
           this bug all day. I'll just get
           back to work --
                         
           Nick wipes his mouth and turns pathetically back to his
           desk.
                         
                          HARKEN
           No. Go home. I don't want you
           getting everyone else sick.
                         
                          NICK
           Oh, okay. Thank you, Mr. Harken.
                         
           Nick grabs his jacket and moves to go.

           Have it on my desk at six AM.
                         
           Nick barely conceals his contempt as he picks up the
           stack of papers and heads out.
                         
                          HARKEN

           Kurt's car pulls up slowly and parks. Kurt, Dale and
           Nick slump down in their seats.

           Okay, boys, as soon as Pellit
           makes a move, we tail him. It is
           on now.
                         
                          NICK
           Oh, it's on.

           Hells yeah!
                         
           They watch the house with steely determination.

           The guys are bored out of their minds, barely awake.
           Dale nibbles on a peanut butter and jelly sandwich in a
           plastic bag.
                         
                          KURT
           Ugghhhhh, I can't believe how much
           this sucks.
                         
                          DALE
           I don't get it. On TV,
           surveillance always looks so
           great. They've got their cups of
           coffee. Their sunflower seeds.
           They talk about their lives.

           And then, right when they reveal
           something really intimate, the
           perp appears and they spring into
           action.
                         
           A long, silent pause as they watch the house...
                         
                          NICK
           Are we even sure he's home?
                         
           They exchange looks.
                         
                          KURT
           (opening his door)
           Let's go check it out.
                         
           They get out of the car. Dale pockets his sandwich.
                         
                         
          60 EXT. PELLIT'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 60
                         
           The three guys creep around Pellit's patio, peeking in
           doors and windows. Finally:
                         
                          NICK
           I don't see him.
                         
           Kurt is about to try a window when Dale stops him.
                         
                          DALE
           What are you doing?
                         
                          KURT
           We're not gonna get intel standing
           on his lawn. We have to go in.
                         
                          DALE
           What about fingerprints? We don't
           have gloves.
                         
                          KURT
           Here, do this.
                         
           Kurt pulls his shirt sleeves down over his hands. Dale
           does the same. Nick, who wears a T-shirt, tucks his
           hands inside the bottom of the shirt. With some
           difficulty, Kurt slides open the window.
                         
                          KURT
           Here we go.
                         
           The three of them manage to wriggle through the window.
           It's not graceful: Dale's foot gets caught on the sill,
           causing him to tumble on top of Nick and Kurt. At last,
           all three are inside.

           Dale, keep an eye out. Let us
           know if Pellit's coming.
                         
                          DALE
           Got it. Wait, I don't know what
           he looks like.
                         
                          NICK
           It doesn't matter. Just tell us
           if anyone comes.
                         
                          DALE
           Got it.
                         
           They take in Pellit's living room. There's a leather
           sofa, a 60-inch plasma and enormous speakers. On the
           wall are framed Ed Hardy posters depicting dragons and
           half-naked girls.
                         
                          KURT
           Wow. This guy's a bigger
           douchebag than me.
                         
                          NICK
           Okay, let's split up. Look for
           any intel we can use on him.
                         
                          KURT
           What kind of intel?
                         
                          NICK
           I don't know. I guess we'll know
           it when we see it.
                         
           Kurt heads upstairs while Dale and Nick look around the
           living room.
                         
                          DALE
           Hey, Nick? Does this count as
           intel?
                         
           Nick looks over to see Dale holding in his sleeve-covered
           hands an open wooden box filled with white powder.
                         
                          NICK
           Holy shit, that's a lot of blow.
                         
                          DALE

           floor, sending a cascade of cocaine all over the rug.
                         
                          NICK

           He kneels and begins trying to scoop up the coke in his
           hands. It's an impossible task.

           useful so he heads into --

           He flips on the light. His eyes land on Pellit's
           toothbrush. He grins slyly.

           Dale is still on his knees, scooping up coke, as Nick
           returns from the kitchen cradling a Dustbuster in his T-

           Look out. Let me try this.
                         
           Struggling with his hands in his T-shirt, Nick vacuums up
           the cocaine from the rug. When he's finished, he pops
           open the vacuum's waste receptacle and dumps the contents
           back in the wooden box.

           increasingly red.
                         
                          DALE
           Get your what?
                         
           With one hand Harken grabs his throat and with the other
           he looks at the plastic bag he's holding.

           Huh? Oh, yeah. It was a peanut
           butter sandwich.
                         
           Harken collapses to his knees. His face is turning blue
           now. Dale quickly steps out of the car.
                         
                          DALE

           Harken yanks up the right leg of his jogging pants
           revealing an EPI-PEN strapped to his ankle. He reaches
           for it, but Dale moves faster.
                         
                          DALE
           What do I do with this? Should I

           Okay, hold on! I got this.
                         
           Dale takes the cap off the epi-pen, raises his arm and
           jams the needle into Harken's chest. Harken lets out a
           grunt.

           Nick ZOOMS away from the curb.

           Nick's car SPEEDS through a red light at an intersection.
           A TRAFFIC CAMERA FLASHES as it snaps Nick's photo and
           license plate.

           With trembling hands, Nick and Dale take deep gulps of
           their drinks. Kurt hurries in, looking disheveled. The
           ensuing conversation is conducted in tense whispers.
                         
                          KURT
           Okay, let's all stay calm and
           figure this out.

           I don't know. I mean, afterwards,
           it was kind of hard to imagine
           killing her.
                         
           Nick and Dale turn to him, quizzically.

           Kurt's car is parked across the street.
                         
           KURT (V.O.)
           At first I was surveilling her
           just like I was supposed to...

           Kurt watches through her bedroom window as Julia
           undresses sexily.
                         
           KURT (V.O.)
           Then she started deliberately
           undressing in front of the window.
           With the lights on. She must've
           known I was there.
                         
           As Julia removes her bra, we see Kurt's face pressed
           against his car window, his breath fogging it up.

           Julia enters her bedroom with a tray of food. She wears
           a skimpy kimono-style robe. She sits on her bed and
           unwraps a Popsicle.
                         
           KURT (V.O.)
           Then she made herself a little
           snack. A Popsicle...
                         
           We see Julia eat the Popsicle as suggestively as humanly
           possible. Then she picks up a banana and peels it.
                         
           KURT (V.O.)
           ... then a banana....
                         
           Julia eases the whole banana into her mouth. Then she
           picks up a hot dog.
                         
           KURT (V.O.)
           ... and finally a hot dog. I
           mean, three penis-shaped foods
           cannot be coincidence. And in
           that weird order? That's not a
           proper meal.

           So you took that as an invitation
           to fuck her?
                         
           Julia opens her front door, stares straight at Kurt and
           beckons him inside with one finger. She walks back
           inside, leaving the door wide open.
                         
           KURT (V.O.)
           No. I took her invitation to fuck
           her as an invitation to fuck her.

           Kurt opens his car door so quickly he tumbles out
           headfirst, planting his face on the street. He jumps up,
           but one ankle is tangled in the seatbelt. He finally
           extricates himself and hurries to the house as fast as he
           can.

           Let me ask you something,

           knew who the shooter was and was
           willing to hand you that perp on a
           platter. Would he be entitled to
           some sort of immunity for that
           information?
                         
           Both Dale and Nick shoot daggers at him.

           No. But he would be entitled to
           some sort of jail time. Because
           if he knew who the shooter was and
           didn't tell us, that would be

           We see Mrs. Harken is intrigued. Just then, the front
           door opens and Harken enters. The lights come on.

           Surprise!
                         
           A jittery Harken nearly jumps out of his skin as the
           crowd starts singing "Happy Birthday." Mrs. Harken takes
           Harken's arm.
                         
           MRS. HARKEN

           He heads off to his study, leaving his confused wife.
           She notices Kurt, standing at the buffet, staring at her.
           He smiles and winks. Mrs. Harken gives him a little
           wave.

           What the -- ?!
                         
           As his leg bleeds, Harken wipes the gun off with his
           shirt, then suddenly tosses it to Dale.
                         
                          HARKEN
           Catch.
                         
           Startled, Dale catches the pistol with shaking hands.

           Now I can tell the cops that when
           I discovered you three killed
           Pellit, you tried to kill me to
           shut me up.
                         
                          KURT
           That's crazy!
                         
           Down the street, two squad cars turn the corner and speed
           toward them. Dale looks down at the gun in his hand and
           drops it.
                         
                          HARKEN
           Is it? Because I don't see a
           shred of evidence proving that I
           killed Pellit. It's like I've
           always told you, Nick. Life is a
           marathon and you can't win a
           marathon without putting a few
           Band-Aids on your nipples.
                         
           Nick deflates. The three guys realize Harken's won.
           Then, from the car's open window they hear:
                         
           ON STAR REP (V.O.)
           Did I mention that this
           conversation is being recorded?
                         
           Kurt, Nick and Dale exchange a look of shock and relief.
                         
                          HARKEN
           Who said that?

           My name is Atmanand!
                         
           Harken's face falls. He looks around nervously as the
           police cars come to a halt.
                         
                          HARKEN
           You can't -- this isn't --
                         
           And with that, Harken BOLTS AWAY as fast as his injured
           leg will take him. It's not very fast. The guys watch
           him for a beat as they share a joyful, exhausted moment
           together.

           This is for you, Gam Gam.
                         
           Nick sprints off after his hobbling boss and in SLOW
           MOTION, violently TACKLES Harken to the pavement. Harken
           goes down hard, his face SLAMMING against the asphalt.
                         
           As the COPS hurry toward them, Nick kneels on the back of
           Harken's neck, pinning him.
                         
                          HARKEN
           Get the fuck off me!
                         
           Kurt steps up and kneels beside the battered figure.

           Kurt enters and looks over at what was Pellit's office.
           He smiles when he sees Margie, the pregnant employee, now
           running the company. He heads over.

           Kurt, I know you were a favorite
           of Jack's. He was willing to
           overlook your inappropriate
           behavior with female clients and
           service people. But you should be
           aware, I'm not Jack. And I have
           very little tolerance for the
           mistreatment of women. So
           consider this your first strike.

           Kurt opens his mouth to say something but thinks better
           of it. He stands up and slumps out. Life as he knew it
           at Pellit Chemicals is clearly over.

           you're going to pay for. And then
           I'm going to come back to a rape-
           free workplace. Because if you so
           much as look at my ass, I'll have
           yours locked up.
                         
           With a bounce in his step, Dale strides out of the room.
           There's an awkward beat with Kenny and Julia.
                         
                          KENNY
           I don't suppose you could take a
           look at this molar --
                         
                          JULIA
                          (SCREAMING)
           OUT! GET OUT!
                         
           Kenny scampers out, pulling up his pants as he goes.
                         
                         
          139 INT. NICK'S OFFICE (FORMERLY HARKEN'S) - DAY 139
                         
           Nick is in his new office as a young employee, CARTER,
           20's, pops his head in.
                         
                          CARTER
           You wanted to see me, Mr. Waters?
                          (CONTINUED)
           119.
                         139 CONTINUED: 139
                         
                          NICK
           Hi, Carter. Just wanted to check
           if you had a chance to finish
           those regional sales projections
           yet?
                         
                          CARTER
           Oh, I think I may need another
           day.
                         
                          NICK
           Okay. I was hoping to give them
           to the marketing guys today, but I
           can hold them off.
                          (FRIENDLY)
           In the future, it'd be great if
           you could tell me if you're going
           to miss a deadline.
                         
           Carter's eyes narrow. All at once, he rushes at Nick,
           grabs him by the throat and HURLS him THROUGH THE PLATE
           GLASS WINDOW, shattering it.
                         
                         
          140 EXT. COMMTRONIX INDUSTRIES - CONTINUOUS ACTION 140
                         
           Nick plummets forty feet and lands with a SICKENING
           CRUNCH directly onto his own car. Just behind him we see
           a parking plaque that reads "Nick Waters, Senior VP of
           Sales."
                         
           SMASH CUT TO:
                         
                         
          141 SAME SCENE (REALITY) 141
                         
           Carter stands opposite Nick as before.
                         
                          CARTER
           Sure. No problem, Mr. Waters.
                         
                          NICK
           Thanks, buddy.
                         
           Nick smiles and closes the door behind Carter. He
           settles into his comfy chair and puts his feet up on the
           desk.
                         
                          NICK
           It's good to be the boss.
                         
           CUT TO BLACK.
                         
                         
                          THE END
